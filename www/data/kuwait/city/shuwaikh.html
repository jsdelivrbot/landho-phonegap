<div class="hello"><div><p>Kuwait Radio (callsign 9KK) maintains listening watch on Channel 16 between 06:00 and 24:00. The Harbour Master should be contacted on arrival and permission requested to enter the port. This is reached through a 4 mile (6.5 km) long dredged channel.</p>
<p>After clearance, foreign yachts are directed to the marina run by the Kuwait Yacht Club situated 5 miles (8 km) SE of the main port.</p>
<p>The entrance is reported to be difficult to find at night because of bright lights ashore.</p>
