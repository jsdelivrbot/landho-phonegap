<li>The North Atlantic island of Ireland is made up of two political units, the independent Republic of Ireland, also known as Eire, and the smaller region of Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. </li>
<li>Ireland has a coastline of nearly 3000 miles with many deep and sheltered bays. Described by some sailing authors as one of the finest cruising grounds in the world, the only missing element to put Ireland at the top of the table is better weather. At least this is more than made up for by a profusion of perfectly sheltered anchorages.</li>
<li>Ireland's three coasts are very different and in their variety they cater for every requirement. The east coast is the most easily accessible for yachts coming from the United Kingdom, but Ireland's real beauty lies on its southern and western coasts. The most popular cruising area is between Cork and the Dingle Peninsula with an abundance of snug harbours and picturesque anchorages.</li>
<li>The wilder west coast is more exposed and the distances between sheltered harbours are greater. Some 200 islands lie scattered off the west coast and only a handful are inhabited. While the east and southwestern coasts have a sizeable local boating population and also attract a number of cruising yachts, the west of Ireland is less frequented.</li>
<li>Repair facilities for yachts range from excellent in such major yachting centres as Cork Harbour to virtually non-existent in some of the smaller ports. The facilities at Crosshaven are possibly the best in Ireland and a whole range of repair services is available. Further east, repair facilities are also available at Youghal and Waterford.</li>
<li>Provisioning in all ports on the east and south coast is good and there are several marinas scattered about. As one moves west, supplies become scarcer and the boat should be well provisioned with food, fuel and water.</li>
<li>A useful source of help are the many yacht clubs dotted about the coasts, the most famous among them being the Royal Cork Yacht Club in Crosshaven, founded in 1720 and considered the oldest yacht club in the world. Most yacht clubs have moorings for visitors who are generally made welcome everywhere.</li>
