<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Dublin is a busy port for large commercial ships and small craft should keep a sharp lookout, and are advised to use the southern entrance channel into the Bay and then to keep to the southern side of the Bay itself. Monitor VHF channel 12 for shipping movements.</span></p>
<p><span>There is excellent shelter here and the marina breakwaters protect the berthed boats from the ferry wash. All the yacht clubs based here offer visitor's berths in addition to those in the marina.</span></p>
<p><strong>Greystones</strong> - A new marina (lying about 15nm south of Dun Laoghaire) has been built here providing very good shelter.</p>
<p><span>Last updated April 2016.</span></p></div></div>
