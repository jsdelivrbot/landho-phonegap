<div class="hello"><div><p><span> Access is possible at all states of the tide, although the entrance to the river can be difficult to locate at night.</span></p>
<p><span>The marina is on the NE bank of the Avoca River and provides perfect shelter. There is also a long pontoon in the river just beyond the marina entrance.</span></p>
<p><span>The fishing harbour, to port as you enter, has now been dredged and a new visitor's pontoon installed. It has room for 20 yachts. It has water and electricity and the charge is a set 10 euro/night (May 2015) per boat.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many moorings in the river and anchoring is not advisable.</span></p>
<p>Anchorage in the bay has good holding, but beware of the whelk pots.</p>
