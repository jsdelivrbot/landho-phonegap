<div class="hello"><div><p>Founded in 853 by the Vikings, Waterford is Ireland’s oldest city. With its impressive medieval city walls, cobbled back streets and colourful waterfront, it is a delightful place to visit. It is also a busy commercial and fishing port.</p>
<p>It lies on the river Suir, and is a useful place to stock up with supplies. The passage up the river is well buoyed and with wonderful scenery making the trip worthwhile. The river is navigable for a further 9 miles beyond the town, but take note of the clearances of the 2 bridges and power cables.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can moor on the pontoons on the South side of the river, opposite the cathedral spire. This is the Waterford City marina.</p>
<p>Anchoring in the river is not recommended as the tidal streams past the town are strong, but there are several anchorages further down the estuary.</p>
<p><span>Dunmore East now has a dedicated pontoon inside the breakwater for yachts. </span><span>The pontoon is a single 60m pontoon which can take 9 yachts in three rafts of 3. It has water and electricity. Installed in June 2016.</span></p>
