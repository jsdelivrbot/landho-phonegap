<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Dublin is a busy port for large commercial ships and small craft should keep a sharp lookout, and are advised to use the southern entrance channel into the Bay and then to keep to the southern side of the Bay itself. Monitor VHF channel 12 for shipping movements.</span></p>
<p><span>Once inside the river, shelter is very good but the entrance can be rough in strong easterlies with an ebb tide.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a marina at Poolbeg and also </span><span>pontoons between the lifting East Link and Samuel Beckett Bridges. They are on the N side of the Liffey and offer convenient access to the city centre. </span></p>
<p>There are several other marinas and repair facilities in and around the capital Dublin, the best centres being at <a><strong>Dun Laoghaire</strong></a>, Howth and Malahide.</p>
<p><span>Malahide is about 12nm north of Dublin Bay and t</span><span>he approach is restricted by a sandbar at LW (LAT 0.8m) and should not be entered in strong on shore winds.</span></p>
<p>The Howth Yacht Club marina has excellent docking facilities and its location is ideal for visiting Dublin. Good provisioning, fuel and LPG are available locally. The club offers temporary membership to those spending the winter here.</p>
