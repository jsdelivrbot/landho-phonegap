<div class="hello"><div><p>Cork Harbour is a natural harbour and river estuary at the mouth of the River Lee in County Cork, Ireland. It is one of the largest natural harbours in the world by navigational area, very much like Halifax Harbour in Canada and Poole Harbour in England.</p>
<p>This area of sheltered water dotted with islands has a moderately wide entrance with shallow water in the middle, opening out into a large expanse of water and shoreline varying from beautiful woodland, picturesque waterfronts to power plants.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Keep a good look out when transiting this very busy harbour as even large commercial vessels can travel at speed here.</p>
<p>Most visiting yachts make for the facilities in Crosshaven as it is the closest to the entrance of Cork Harbour (on the Owenboy River about 12 miles from Cork City) and has three marinas and a pier (very busy in summer).</p>
<p>However, there are other marinas to be found in this large harbour, either up the East Passage to Cobh (pronounced. “Cove”) or the West Passage to Cork City itself where there is a 150m yacht pontoon at Custom House Quay, just below the Michael Connolly bridge.</p>
<p>A welcome addition is the new Cork Harbour Marina, in Monkstown Bay opposite the Cork Dockyard.</p>
<p>This harbour is full of small boat clubs, so every available anchoring spot is littered with small boat moorings. Beyond Crosshaven, further up the Owenboy River, you might find a spot to anchor among the moorings. There may be more space up the East Passage beyond the East Ferry Marina, although a strong current runs here (see comment below by cruiser who succesfully anchors here).</p>
<p>The problem with anchoring is finding a place to land the dinghy. Much of the shore dries to mud and it is likely your anchoring spot will be pretty isolated.</p>
