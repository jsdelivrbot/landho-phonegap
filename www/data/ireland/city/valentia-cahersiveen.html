<div class="hello"><div><p>Valentia Harbour is enclosed by Beginish Island, the mainland and Valentia Island. There are two entrances, the principal one being to the south, past Cromwell Point on Valentia, where there is a lighthouse with sectored leading lights.</p>
<p>The alternative, northern entrance is on the other side of Beginish Island via Lough Kay. Note that this entrance is not as straightforward as the Cromwell Point entrance but does have channel marks. Note that as of mid-2015 the Kay Rock mark in the northern harbour approach is missing.<span> </span></p>
<p>Beware that in heavy western or north western gales and swell, these entrances may not be feasible due to breaking waves at the entrance.<span> </span></p>
<p>Cahersiveen Harbour is accessed by a well-marked tidal channel of 2 NM that leads east from the Lough Kay entrance to Valentia Harbour. There is a marina at Cahersiveen which is within easy walking distance of the town. <span> </span></p>
<p>Valentia Harbour is centred on the attractive village of Knightstown. There is a partially constructed marina that provides (free) berthing on the marina breakwaters (2015). There are no longer any visitors moorings here.</p>
<p>It is easy to land a dinghy at Knightstown. Care should be taken in selecting an anchorage as some area are quite exposed to the SE. Also the holding can be tricky in many parts of the harbour due to kelp.<span> </span></p>
<p>The shallow channel between Valentia and the mainland, the Portmagee Channel,<span> is narrow, and, at the village of Portmagee, is blocked by a low swing bridge which no longer opens.</span></p>
<p><b>Portmagee Harbour</b> is, therefore, a separate port of call  and a few hours sail from Valentia Harbour.  It is accessed via the entrance near Bray Head on Valentia. This entrance can be difficult in strong winds. Portmagee is an attractive village with a new small marina. Call the Moorings Restaurant in advance to book a berth at this marina. Any visitors moorings at Portmagee are no longer maintained and cannot, therefore, be recommended. The main pier is reserved for fishing boats.</p>
