<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Centre of Bantry town can be reached by Dinghy at high tide, otherwise it is a good walk from the sailing club slip. A new marina is scheduled to be completed behind the town pier by 2017.</span></p>
<p>The northern shore provides many sheltered anchorages, although the Bay itself is exposed to the SW’lies. Lawrence Cove marina is tucked into an inlet on the N side of Bear Island and Whiddy Island protects Bantry and provides several sheltered swinging moorings.</p>
<p>Also providing shelter in substantial inlets, are Adrigole Harbour and, the stunning setting of Glengarriff Harbour.</p>
<p>Castletown Bere, north of Bear Island, is closely protected by the small Dinish Island which forms the southern side of the harbour. The western entrance, Piper Sound, is the normal approach, as the eastern one is spanned by a low bridge. The anchorage is good in about 2.5m, in mud.</p>
