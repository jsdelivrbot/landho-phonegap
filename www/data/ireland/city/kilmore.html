<div class="hello"><div><p>A useful port of call on on Ireland's SE Coast.  The harbour needs to be approached with caution and it is advisable to avoid arriving at low water. However, the entrance is well marked, although it is exposed in SE winds.</p>
<p>There is now a Safe Water Mark in approx position 52° 9.3' N, 6° 35.4' W (WGS84 Datum). This is directly on the leading line transits and therefore useful if crossing St Patrick's Bridge in less than ideal visibility. It is safer to use this rather than rely on GPS positions.</p>
<p><span>Kilmore Quay is a very active fishing harbour and fishing trawlers enter and exit the very narrow marina entrance at all hours (especially at HW+/-2).</span></p></div></div>
