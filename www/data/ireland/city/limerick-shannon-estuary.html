<div class="hello"><div><p>There are visitors’ mooring buoys at various locations; Loop Head, Carrigaholt Bay, between Kilcredaun Head and the river Fergus. There is a yacht club pontoon at Foynes island.</p>
<p>Limerick itself is a commercial port, but now has a new marina in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>For those who can lower their mast, exploring the river beyond Limerick is an interesting challenge. See the <a href="http://www.iwai.ie/events/Warning-Limerick_and_Ardnacrusha.html"><b>Inland Waterways site</b></a> for more information.</p></div></div>
