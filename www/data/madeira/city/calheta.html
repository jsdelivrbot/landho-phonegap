<div class="hello"><div><p>Being at the western end of the island this is the sunniest part
of Madeira. This port, for some reason, does not appear to feature in many crusing guides, but it is a Port of Entry and has a marina for about 300 yachts. It is situated about 14NM west of Funchal.</p>

      This marina is the 2nd largest in Madiera. All facilities including waste disposal. Yacht club. The staff here are reported to be excellent.  

Care is needed when leaving the marina as some of the concrete defences have fallen into the
south side of the channel.  Keeping to the starboard side means keeping to the centre of the channel especially where the concrete defences meet the mole.
