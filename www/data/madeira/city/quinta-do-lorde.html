<div class="hello"><div><p>When approaching the marina contact the staff on VHF 16/9, to assist you with manoeuvres, with a Zodiac. The Marina office is located in front of pontoon E. Staff are reported to be very helpful here.</p>
<p>The marina provides good shelter for boats, but it can suffer from significant surge. The visitors pontoon was damaged and has not yet been replaced. <span>If available the hammerheads are best used for overnight arrivals.</span></p>
<p>It also offers winter storage. There are gates on every pontoon, however cruisers report that crew have a tendancy to leave these open.</p>
