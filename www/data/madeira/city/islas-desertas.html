<div class="hello"><div><p>This long, thin chain of islands lies about 15nm SE of the eastern tip of Madeira.</p>
<p>The three islands are barren and uninhabited (apart from a ranger camp) and are a designated nature reserve. The largest native european tarantula can be found here - up to 10cm across! A rare colony of monk seals inhabit the beach which is another reason why these islands are protected.</p>
<p>There is good snorkling around the islands, but hiking the mountain is no longer possible due to the erosion of the path. </p>
