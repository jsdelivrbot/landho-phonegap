<div class="hello"><div><p>Located on the southern coast of Madeira, Funchal is a popular port of call for cruise ship. It lies in a bowl with a dramatic mountain backdrop. It has many spectacular festivals, the foremost of which is that held on New Years Eve.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The inner harbour at Funchal is run as a small marina, mainly full of local boats. Formalities are completed at the reception dock, immediately to starboard on entrance to the marina. Note this dock is low and only really suitable for boats up to 13m.</p>
<p>Officers from Guarda Fiscal (Customs) and Policia Maritima (Immigration) are here daily. If there is no space to come alongside, boats should anchor in the outer harbour and visit the office by dinghy. The Guarda Fiscal will issue a transit log to non-EU yachts arriving from outside of Madeira. Even if coming from Porto Santo, the clearance procedure must still be completed. On departure the marina office and all other officials must be visited.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Docking facilities for visitors in the main harbour at Funchal are not very comfortable as there are no pontoons available, and boats have to raft to the quay walls. Larger boats over 13m will find it hard to find space here. Turning room is very tight.</p>
<p>During the busy months of October and November, if wishing to moor here, anchoring in the centre of the harbour may be the only option. Note that during public holidays there are no dockmasters available. An increasing number of cruise ships are calling here, to encourage this, and to allow the docking of even larger vessels, the commercial activities are being moved to Canical, to the east of Funchal.</p>
<p>A more comfortable and secure berth can now be found in the new marina at Quinta do Lorde, 2 nm from Canical, at the eastern end of the island. The approaches to this marina can be easily identified by the wind farm on the land to the west of the entrance.</p>

      The yacht club is located several kilometres to the west of the marina at 235 Estrada Monumental. The club also has a large facility in the Funchal dock and boatyard area just across the river outlet to the west of the marina. The boatyard facility has several workshops and yacht club members, who work on their own boats, can help in finding expert assistance if repairs are needed.
