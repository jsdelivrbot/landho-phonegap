<div class="hello"><div><p>A new marina was built here in 2004 but has been destroyed twice by southerly winds in February 2006 and 2007. This should have been the biggest marina in Madeira with the capacity to receive up to 370 boats.</p>
<p>The marina is now closed without any forecast of re-opening for at least 3 years. The proposed project is to build an inside wall, to protect the marina, therefore reducing the marina to 1/3 of its original size. A hotel associated to the marina is also planned.</p>
<p>No further information available as at January 2013.</p></div></div>
