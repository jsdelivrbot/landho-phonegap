<div class="hello"><div><p>Most cruisers prefer to moor at Placencia, across the lagoon from Big Creek as t<span>he channel in to the commercial harbour at Big Creek is busy and narrow.</span></p>
<p>Placencia is still primarily a fishing village, although recently it has become a popular tourist destination. Ashore there are grocery stores, hardware stores, a small chandlery and lots of restaurants and souvenir shops. A new boatyard opened here in 2015.</p>
