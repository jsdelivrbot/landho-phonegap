<div class="hello"><div><p>Ambergris Cay is twenty-five miles long and is the largest of the 200-plus islands located off the Belize coast. It ranges in width from a few hundred feet to over four miles and is separated from the southernmost tip of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula by a small channel.</p>
<p>For most of the year, the tradewinds keep the temperature down and the mosquitos away. It is a popular location for snorkling and diving.</p>
<p><span>Position 17°55'N, 087° 53'W (anchorage)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an official port of entry with Customs, Immigration and Quarantine officers on duty, all based in adjacent offices at the Police Station.
Since these officials do not seem to coordinate their office times, the clearing in/out process can be rather drawn out.</p>
<p>As the entrance through the reef is rather complicated, one should call San Pedro Yacht Club on Channel 16 for directions. One can go straight to the yacht club (identified by the Texaco sign) to complete formalities. San Pedro is located just south of the Mexican border and therefore convenient for yachts arriving from or leaving for Mexico.</p>
