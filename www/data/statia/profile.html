<div><ul>
<li>St Eustatius is now part of the Netherland, and known as Statia (pronounced "STAY-SHA").</li>
<li>the island lies north of St Kitts in the Leeward Island chain and is just 5 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.</li>
<li>the only anchorage is off the main village of Oranjestad, in Oranje Baai, which is an open roadstead where the swell usually makes itself felt.</li>
<li>Statia is a free port, like Saba and Sint Maarten.</li>
<li>Services are quite basic, although the situation has improved with moorings for visiting yachts being laid both in the harbour and marine park. Maintenance of these moorings however is reported to be poor.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><span>Free Cruising Guides have completed the Caribbean Security Index (CSI) review of 2013 and updated the country ratings. The latest update of the CSI contains new information that may be important to you to “route around crime.”</span><br/><span>See this report at</span><strong><a href="Countries/Anguilla/General/Piracy/caribbean-crime-caribbean-security-index-csi-review-of-2013">http://www.noonsite.com/General/Piracy/caribbean-crime-caribbean-security-index-csi-review-of-2013</a></strong></p>
