<div><p>Proceed ashore and check in with Customs and Immigration which is based in 3 modified white containers at the head of the main town dock (see the large "Customs" sign). The office is normally open 08:00-16:00, although there is often someone around out of hours.</p>
<p>Clearance is reported to be easy and straightforward with no fees. For a <span>short stay officials will clear you out at the same time.</span></p>
<p>Now Statia is part of the Netherlands, the eSeaClear computer system is not being used.</p>
<p>Currently Dutch officials are much in evidence and will sometimes board to check papers and equipment.</p>
