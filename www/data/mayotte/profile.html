<li><b>Update August 2016</b>: An outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Reunion and Rodrigues has resulted in strict food import restrictions. See this <a href="Countries/ReunionIsland/reunion-island-rodrigues-an-outbreak-of-foot-and-mouth-disease"><b>Noonsite report</b></a>.</li>

<li>Mayotte Island is geographically part of the Comoros archipelago, a small group of islands lying between the northern tip of Madagascar and East Africa in the Indian Ocean. </li>
<li>As of 1st January 2014 Mayotte became <span style="text-align: justify; ">‘an outermost region’ </span>of the European Union. It is an <span style="text-align: justify; ">overseas administrative department of France and t</span>he French Navy maintain a naval base on the island.</li>
<li>The island is surrounded by reefs and the main harbour at Dzaoudzi is very well-protected. There are many anchorages inside the reef and diving is excellent.</li>
<li>Some repair facilities are available in Dzaoudzi. Supplies are better than in the neighbouring Comoros and most imported goods are French.</li>
<li>The other three islands in the group, Grande Comore, Moheli and Anjouan, now form the independent republic of <a href="Countries/Comoros">Comoros</a>.</li>

<div><p>Noonsite has previously received more than one report about the increase of crime and violence on the island, and how this is affecting visiting yachts. However, there have been no reports in the last 2 years.</p>
<p>It would be wise to take the usual precautions to protect your dinghy and outboard and to secure the boat against intruders.</p>
