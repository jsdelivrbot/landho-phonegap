<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on Grand Terre, opposite the clearance port of Dzaoudzi. <span>There is a frequent ferry service between the two ports. Mamoudzou has better shoreside facilities, chandleries/repair service companies etc. however Dzaoudzi is better protected from a berthing point of view. </span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../MazamadouMarinafromtheferry_MBarzam.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina here is full of local motorboats, as well as a few sailboats on moorings in the not-so-protected bay, so visitor berthing is unlikely. One can however come alongside for water.</span></p>
