<div class="hello"><div><p>With the winds and currents in the lagoon, ensure you are not anchored too close to the local boats on their moorings. At night, the SE trades often swing into local NW winds and the current can cause boats to lay in a fairly confused order.</p>
<p>Another special feature of this well-sheltered bay, is the huge, unlit mooring buoys. A surprisingly large number of ferries and barges operate between the islands and at nightfall, they moor to these buoys. Not only is this a rather noisy experience, but it may well give you a new neighbour at midnight, swinging some 60 meters around its mooring. Staying well away from these moorings is therefore a good idea.</p>
<p>When anchoring, be sure your anchor, preferably two anchors, are well dug in. During the northern monsoon, a swell as much as 3m can penetrate the bay.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/dzaouzidinghydock_MBarzam.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/>The Harbour Master at Dzaoudzi ("Charlie Tango") is doing his best to help arriving yachts. He provides a daily weather report which is posted at the yacht club and at the entrance to the pontoon(in French).</p>
<p>There is a floating pontoon which provides a dingy landing <i>(see photo courtesy of Michael Barzam)</i>.</p>
<p>The yacht club (see below) has the ony mooring buoy in Mayotte for visitors! It <span>can be picked-up by any visitor free of charge if it is vacant. It is located close to the reef where two wrecks are (one monohull and one catamaran – they are conspicuous). GPS coordinates of the buoy: 12 46.839S / 45 15.823E. This is a good option if vacant as anchoring might mean you are more than a mile from the dinghy landing.</span></p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> At position 12 46.587S / 45 15.956E there is a wreck marked with an orange floating jerry can. The top of the mast can be seen at low tide, but it is submerged at high tide and it is easy to hit the mast if heading for the vistor's buoy.</p>
