<div><p>It is important to enter the lagoon via the Mzambouru pass and <strong>not</strong> through the Bandrele pass. There is some doubt as to whether this is permitted or not. One cruiser reported having no problem, another said you will be fined if you do so. However, it is not the best entry if there is an easterly swell. Best advice is to contact the Port Captain for permission in advance.</p>
<p><strong>On Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Contact the Port Captain (Capitainerie du Port) on VHF 16 or VHF 9 upon arrival.</p>
<p><span><span>The marina in </span></span><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mayotte/mamoudzou">Mamoudzou</a></strong> </span><span>(see Frederic who is in charge) can organise entry and departure clearance, however finding space may be difficult. Weekend clearance is also possible. </span></p>
<p>In<strong> </strong><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mayotte/Dzaoudzi">Dzaoudzi</a> </strong>clearance formalities are done ashore and the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mayotte/Dzaoudzi?rc=PortProfile#YachtClubs">ACHM</a> </strong>hold all forms, not the Port Captain. They are located 200m to the left of the ferry landing (open 11:00 to 20:00). The Yacht Club members are very friendly and most speak English. Note that if you base yourself in Dzaoudzi, you will need to take a ferry to Mamoudzou to complete clearance.</p>
<p><span><strong>Clearing-in</strong></span></p>
<p>Take the completed clearance forms to Customs first, then to Immigration <span>(at the airport) </span><span>where it has to be stamped, and finally to the Maritime Authorities/Port Captain. </span><span>Customs may want to visit (and search) the boat.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Finding Immigration at the airport is a little unusual. There is an empty office (labelled POLICE) in the main airport arrival hall, with one phone at the front desk and A4 size paper with instructions of which number to call. Call that number and Immigration will find you within a minute or two.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Maritime Authorities are located in <span>Mamoudzou, which you can reach by ferry if you are based in </span><span>Dzaoudzi. T<span>hey are housed in a container close to the passenger ferry landing at Mamoudzu, so quick and easy to find.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Clearance is possible on Saturday and Sunday mornings but the <span>Port Captain's office is only open 07:00 to 09:00 at weekends.</span> Basic French is required as the officials do not normally have any English. All boats, whether French or not, must clear in.</p>
<p>Once clearance has been completed, yachts may explore the lagoon freely.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing-out</strong></p>
<p>Prior to departure, outward clearance must be obtained.</p>
<p>All officials must be visited for outward clearance. Take your completed outward clearance form to Immigration first (at the airport, as above), then to Customs where the same form will be stamped a 2nd time, then to the maritime authorities in Mamoudzou (as detailed above). Show them the double stamped form and they will issue outward clearance to the next port.<span> </span></p>
<p>This must be done the day before the intended departure, or before 11:00 if planning to leave that same afternoon.</p>
