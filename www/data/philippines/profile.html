<ul>
<li>The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7000 islands lying between the 
Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. They are divided into three regions: 
Luzon to the north, the Visayas in the centre, and Mindanao in the south.</li>
<li>The Philippines has been a popular cruising destination for many years. Day-
sailing through the archipelago is undoubtedly the best way to visit this vast 
area and one can find a good anchorage every night. This also avoids the danger 
of running into one of the many unlit fishing boats, as well as their nets or 
traps. Cebu and the surrounding islands have some of the most attractive 
anchorages and places such as Romblon and Puerto Galera should not be missed.</li>
<li>Although the government is trying to stamp out corruption and also to 
standardise the entry and exit charges applied to yachts, the situation is 
confused. On the positive side, however, the Philippines have a lot to offer the 
cruising sailor and in spite of such inherent difficulties, it remains a country 
well worth visiting.</li>
<li>There are small boatyards in various islands and the Filipinos are skilled 
workers, particularly in wood. Teak is still widely available, but while its 
price is steadily increasing, its quality is deteriorating.</li>
<li>General repair facilities, such as engine or electrical repair, are also 
available in most centres, the widest range being concentrated in and around 
Manila. Most marine supplies have to be imported, but local nautical charts are 
available both in Manila and Cebu.</li>
<li>The majority of Filipinos speak good English as a second language and almost 
all newspapers are published in English.</li>

<div><p><strong>August 2016:</strong> For some useful comments from cruisers in the Philippines see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/phillipines-palawan-warning-about-kidnapping-danger-in-the-tagbita-bay-area/report_view#1470297049125163">this report</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>April 2016: </strong>Both the US and the UK governments have <span>advised against all travel to south-west Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago due to the high risk of kidnapping of international travellers and the increased threat of maritime kidnappings against small boats.</span></p>
<p>There are persistent rumours about  the danger of pirates in the south of Mindanao and the Sulu Sea and yachts generally avoid this area. General advice seems to be to s<span>tay away from the Southern PI, including South Palawan and be careful heading between PI and </span>Malaysia<span>.</span></p>
<p>A well known marina on Samal Island near Davao in the southern Philippines was<strong> stormed by armed men</strong> in September 2015 and four yachties were kidnapped. Two of the captives were executed and two were released. See report <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/philippines-samal-island-yachties-abducted-from-ocean-view-resort-marina">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>German couple were abducted</strong> from their yacht by bandits <span>at Palawan </span><span>on their way back to Sabah in Malaysia after island-hopping in Mindanao, </span><span>in April 2014. Read news report <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/philippines-german-cruising-couple-abducted-in-april-in-hands-of-asg-bandits">here</a></strong>. This area south of Palawan continues to be a dangerous area.</span></p>
<p><span>The area off the west coast at the southern end of Palawan, in particular T<span>agbita Bay, is also an area that should be avoided. See this <a href="Countries/Philippines/phillipines-palawan-warning-about-kidnapping-danger-in-the-tagbita-bay-area"><strong>latest Noonsite report</strong></a>.</span></span></p>
<p>A long-term cruiser in the Philippines sent <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/philippines-security-advice/">this report </a></strong>to noonsite with security advice and places to avoid if cruising the country.</p>
<p><span>People are extremely friendly everywhere in the Philippines, however, the uncertain political situation in some parts of the country has seen worrying rebel groups developing in certain areas which means cruisers should explore with care and a carefully planned itinerary.</span></p>
