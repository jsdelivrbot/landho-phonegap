<div><p>Yachts must clear in at a designated port of entry before the crew may go ashore anywhere. The Port Authorities/Coast Guard must be notified immediately upon entry. It is best to arrive on a weekday, but even then your VHF call may not be answered. Try calling the Port Office by cell phone.</p>
<p>Overnight stops, while proceeding to such a port, are normally tolerated but there should be no contact with anyone before proper clearance formalities have been completed.</p>
<p>See Clearance <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for details on how much clearance should cost.</p>
<p>Yachts, especially those with animals on board, are expected to contact the quarantine medical officer 24 hours before arrival, but the authorities are aware of the impracticality of this requirement and may waive it, provided the yacht proceeds to an official port of entry.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months beyond the planned stay.</p>
<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> If flying back into the country on the return half of a ticket, American Airlines (and maybe others) now require an onward ticket even if you have documents showing your boat is berthed in the country.</i></p>
<p>No visa is required for stays of up to 30 days for most nationals with an extension of a further 29 days, provided their onward passage is assured. For details on applying for an extension of stay beyond the initial 59 days, see the <a href="http://www.immigration.gov.ph/index.php/visa-requirements/non-immigrant-visa/temporary-visitor-visa/extension-of-authorized-stay-beyond-59-days"><b>Philippines/Immigration</b></a> website. Fees vary but should be displayed in the Immigration office. It is advisable for anyone planning to cruise the Philippines to obtain a 60 day visa in advance as this avoids the additional fees involved in obtaining an extension. </p>
<p>Further extensions can be obtain up to a maximum stay of 6 months at which time you must leave the country.</p>
<p>Nationals requiring a visa:- Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Bangladesh, Belize, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, China (PR), CIS, Croatia, Cuba, East Timor, Egypt, Estonia, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Korea (Dem Rep), Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Lithuania, Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of), Nauru, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Yemen.</p>
<p>The validity of the visa starts from the date of checking in at the first port of entry.</p>
<p>A convenient place to obtain a visa in advance is the Philippine Consulate General in Brisbane, Australia. As well as passport, form and photograph signed on the reverse, it is required to submit an itinerary, date and port of entry into the Philippines and details of the vessel. The cost of the visa depends on the nationality.</p>

<div><p>Having a Customs Clearance form declaring the boat’s entry into the Philippines is very useful when flying out of the country and subsequently re-entering. It is likely the airline will ask that you have a return or on-going ticket when you enter the Philippines, but by showing your Customs papers you can prove that you are returning to your boat and will be exiting the Philippines in it. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/philippines-new-requirement-when-flying-back-into-the-country">reports adjacent</a></strong> for latest on this topic.</p>
<p>Some Customs officials will state that yachts are required to clear in and out of all major ports in the Philippines as they cruise. In practice, very few do.</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared to customs on arrival.</p>
<p>Prohibited items include pornographic material, narcotics and internationally  prohibited drugs, unless accompanied by a medical prescription.</p>
<p>All boat items imported into the Philippines, either through an agency, chandlery  or privately, attract a 40% import duty.</p>

<div><p>Officially yachts should gain free entry for one year and the only charges are for immigration visa extensions.</p>
<p>However, in practice, many local officials charge for what they call "special services" (this could be overtime, even if the delay is their fault) and may also try to charge for a deratting certificate, which is not required by small pleasure craft.</p>
<p>Clearance fees can vary from  500 peso to clear in and out (approx. US$12) to US$50 depending on which clearance port you choose and which officials you encounter. <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Philippines/SubicBay">Subic Bay</a></strong> seems a particularly expensive place to clear-in. This fee includes the first 21 day visa although the same fees are payable even if you have a visa in advance and some ports will charge a US$50 per person fee for immigration.</p>

<div><p>Some tips on understanding Filipinos, taken from a forum posting by a cruiser who lived in the Philippines for 4 years.</p>
<p>Watch your anger. Filipinos are raised in multi-generational households living close together where expressing anger is not conducive to harmony. You discredit yourself in their eyes.</p>
<p>If you ask a question and get no reply, it could be one of several things:<br/> 1. They slightly lifted their eyebrows which means yes.<br/> 2. They squinched up their nose which means no.<br/> 3. They moved their head. Wherever their nose was pointing it means that way.<br/> 4. It means they don't want to answer. For Filipinos this is not impolite.</p>
<p>Also if they answer with a double vowel sound (ah-ah, uh-uh, etc.) It means yes.</p>
<p>If someone younger takes your hand and puts it on their head it's a sign of respect.</p>
<p>You indicate you want a trike, taxi, or bus to stop by extending your arm at an angle to the ground with palm open. If you want to tell them which way you are going, do the same with your arm pointing in the direction you want to go.</p>
<p>If someone squeezes past you, bowed over with arm pointing to the ground, it means "excuse me".</p></div>
