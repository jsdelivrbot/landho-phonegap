<div class="hello"><div><p><u>Culion Island</u></p>
<p>This is the second largest island in the group and has little tourist development. The main town, Culion, is on the north eastern coast. It has many historic buildings. There is a good anchorage in the bay to the east and dinghies can be tied to one of the piers off the town.</p>
<p>The small stores here, together with the market at the western end of the waterfront, provide all the basics.</p>
<p>There is a newly rebuilt hospital with good services.</p>
<p><u>Busuanga Island</u></p>
<p>This is the largest island in the group and the region's main town, Coron is here.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage off the town, behind the reef, in 9m. Watch out for the many floating lines in the approach. There is a more sheltered anchorage NW of Discovery Island in 6-8m but this involves a longer dinghy trip to reach the town.</p>
<p>Provisioning is good in the many small stores and the markets. There are several bakeries, hardware stores, laundry services and restaurants. Internet connections and phone services are good and the town has three banks with ATMs. Fuel is available and can be delivered in drums to the wharf or jerry jugged by dinghy.</p>
<p>Busuanga Yacht Club Palawan Philippines offers free moorings to cruising yachts. Located on Busuanga Island, the Yacht Club is located at the beautiful new Puerto Del Sol Resort, in Puerto Del Sol Bay,Concepcion, near Coron.</p>
