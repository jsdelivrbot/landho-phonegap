<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Puerto Galera</b><span> is at the NW tip of the</span><span> </span>province<span> of </span>Oriental Mindoro. <span>It is located at the SW end of the </span>Isla Verde Passage<span>, about 130 kilometers south of </span>Manila<span>. It's a popular tourist destination with many beautiful "pocket" beaches and dive spots and stunning mountain scenery.</span></p>
<p>Be cautious if stopping on your way to Puerto Galero. A popular bad weather shelter before rounding the Cape on the NW point of Mindoro is Paluan Bay. A cruising couple were boarded by armed men and robbed at gunpoint here in February 2013 (see report adjacent). <strong>Cruisers are advised to stay away from this bay and be wary of anyone approaching your boat at night.</strong></p></div></div>

      Pandan Island is the only resort on the West coast of Mindoro and is the gateway to Apo Reef, and also a good waypoint for yachts travelling to Coron, Basuanga. It has a restaurant and dive shop.

There is a good anchorage south west of the beach, in fair and medium weather conditions. For vessels with less than two metre draft there is a sandy area about four metres deep, vessels with more draft need to anchor further offshore in about 25 metres of water (good holding in mud). Avoid dropping your anchor between the two areas as the steep slope may cause your anchor to drag in northerly winds.
