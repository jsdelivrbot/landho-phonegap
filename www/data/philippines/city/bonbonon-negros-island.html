<div class="hello"><div><p id="content">Tambobo Bay is at the southern tip of Negros Oriental and behind it the cruisers' haven of <span>Bonbonon. This beautiful deep cove with </span><span>a “dog leg” entrance makes it fully </span><span>enclosed, very comfortable and calm in </span><span>most weather. </span></p>
<p><span>The bay is surrounded by </span><span>mangroves and tall green jungle growth </span><span>and in the background, the tall peaks of </span><span>two mountains appear, though they are </span><span>often covered in cloud.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Bonbonon</span><span> is one of the principal hurricane holes in the Philippines being far enough south to keep it in the safer portion of the island group and fairly shallow with good holding in mud.</span></p>
<p>The mouth of the river is shallow so it is recommended to enter as close to high tide as possible. <span>The approach </span><span>to the entrance may be difficult to spot but m</span><span>ost people use a track on </span><span>openCPN or Maxsea to get in to the harbour, which probably helps. <span>The reef on the approach to Bonbonon is now buoyed with small white drums.</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Moorings are available from Boy and Arlene's Cafe, phone <span>09173612437</span> (who do a </span><span>Friday buffet and simple meals during the week), or from Emma (who has </span><span>a buffet too on Wednesday). Both are situated on the waterside. Arlene and Boy have a dinghy dock which they are happy for cruisers to use.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Good potable water is available free at the pump opposite Emmas.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring is in mud, good holding in about 5-10 metres. This is one of </span><span>the safest anchorages in the Philippines, but can be a little crowded </span><span>at times, with some yachts staying indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span><span> Fuel is not available except if you take your jerrycans to </span><span>Tambobo, the village at the entrance </span><span>to Bonbonon. See the fuel section for more details.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Basic stocking up can be done in Siaton or Zambuguita (approx. 14km away), but for more </span><span>selection and things like yogurt, good cheeses and other delicacies, it </span><span>is necessary to go to Dumaguete, about 30 km away.</span></p>
