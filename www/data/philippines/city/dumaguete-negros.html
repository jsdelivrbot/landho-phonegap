<div class="hello"><div><p><span> It is possible to anchor off the city of Dumaguete with care. The bottom here is gently sloping with very good holding in sand. Yachts can anchor in approx. 5 to 7 mts in a stretch between south of the wharf and the next point, which has many fishing bangkas both moored off and ashore. </span></p>
<p><span>There are both steps in the seawall and a small beach for dinghy access.</span></p>
