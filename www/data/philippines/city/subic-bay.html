<div class="hello"><div><p>Subic Bay is situated on the western coast of Luzon, which is the largest island in the Philippines. It is about 100km north of Manila. It is rich in panoramic views, green landscapes and old Spanish houses. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Whilst officially there should be no clearance charges for the Philippines, in practice many ports do charge and this is one of them. Be warned that clearance fees here are high.</p>
<p>If coming from the South <span> it may be better to clear in at Puerto Princessa, for example, where no fees are charged. </span></p>
<p>Review full clearance details for this country at <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Philippines?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Philippines Formalities</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span>Cruisers report being charged US$50 by Customs for both inward &amp; outward clearance, plus US$50 per person for immigration and US$50 for quarantine.</span></p>
<p>All officials will want to come to your boat so they can claim the above overtime/fieldwork charges, so taking the time to visit the various offices yourself is a waste of time. Some officials are reported to be more friendly than others.</p>
<p>If is now possible to get visa extensions here <span>in Olongapo at their new office</span> (remember <span>you only get a 30 day visa on arrival)</span>, rather than having to travel to Manila. Take cash as their is no card service.

<div class="hello"><div><p>The mountain ranges around the Subic Bay area and the deep natural harbour provide an excellent, protected anchorage. In addition, these features make it a natural shelter from typhoons as well as from the effects of the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/SubicBayYachtClub_SYJanna1.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/>The Subic Bay Yacht Club was developed as a world class resort, however recent reports from cruisers are that  the marina is in a run-down state. Whilst most of the pontoons are in service, there is a lack of power and water on some fingers. Note however that this is a private member club that offers some visitor berths. Whilst rates are cheap for members, they may seem high for visitors particularly considering the <span>state of the marina is below standard. </span><span>Some repairs are possible. </span><i>See photo by </i><span><i>SY Janna who visited in May 2013.</i></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Yachts can anchor out or pick up a mooring at Blue Rock Resort.</span><span> Most cruisers tend to choose Watercraft's small marina (next door to the Yacht Club in the tax free zone in the former US naval Base) which is cheaper. The Yacht Club does let "yachties" use their facilities for a small charge (including a pool), although again, these are now rather a poor standard.</span></p>

      Located on the island of Luzon, recommended for clearance for Hong Kong. Latest update May 2013 is that facilities have not been maintained, nothing works and the showers and toilets are dirty. Cruisers now must pay to use the pool. Prices are high (33 USD for boat &lt;40' LOA). This is a safe facility for typhoon season with 24hr security.
