<div class="hello"><div><p>This was once a tourist resort, but now is rarely visited by land tourists. Visiting yachts are warmly welcomed by the locals. The bay lies on the north end of Palawan's west coast, just south of Boayan Island.</p>
<p>It is not a port, just a large, peaceful, sheltered bay, protected by several off lying islands.</p>
<p><span>Position 10°25'30"N, 119°09'E (Port Barton Bay)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The nearest port for clearance, is <a href="../PuertoPrincesa"><strong>Puerto Princesa</strong></a>, which can be reached by regular van service which runs several times a day, both ways. Leave on the 6am van and return on the 4pm one.</p>
<p><span>The van drops you at  San Jose terminal just north of Puerto Princesa. You will then need to take a tricycle ride into city Immigration or to the airport. The journey takes about 3 hrs and costs aproximately 300 peso</span>.</p>
<p><span>Imigration in Puerto  Princesa is free. <br/>Customs is 115 peso. <br/>Only the captain needs to go. </span></p>
<p><span>Port Barton is accepted as a valid port to leave the boat while completing clearance.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is reported to be a safe place to stay and anchor. The bottom is gently shelving sand with good holding. I<span>n the north east monsoon a swell comes into the bay mainly on the south side, so in these conditions anchor at the north end of the beach to avoid the swell. The dinghy can be left anywhere on the beach.</span></p>
<p>Ashore there is fuel, water and supplies, also several restaurants.</p>
<p>A good contact is Brian Tennant who runs a lodge and accommodation here.</p>
