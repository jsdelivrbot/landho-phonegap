<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Carmen is situated on the eastern side of Cebu Island, in the centre of the 
Visayan Island group. It is approximately 30 miles north of Cebu City. </p>
<p>The approaches and entry to Port Carmen can be difficult because of the 
discoloured water and fringing reefs. </p>
<p>Not only is this a good place to leave your boat while you do some land travel, it 
is also a good option for repair work. There are several boatyards here which are 
becoming more popular with transient cruising boats for refit work.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The outer anchorage at the south arm of Port Carmen (near Zeke's) has good holding and reasonable depth, but the entrance is tricky. Open CPN/Google earth is very accurate in this area though and can be used with confidence.</span></p>

      Also known as H and M Boat Services, run by Pepe Hermosilla. Whilst this is principally a repair facility, there are 16 slips for rent. This yard/marina is accessed through Zeke's yard and is at the end of the Southern arm of Pt. Carmen. The yard is fairly primitive, with rickety docks, limited workspace under cover, no running water and no showers/toilets, however it has received very good reports from cruisers, particularly for woodwork and fibreglass repairs.

      Located towards the end of the southern arm of Pt. Carmen. Full service yacht storage, maintenance and repair facility with slips for rent (electricity and water) and large modern club house with bar, restaurant, WiFi and toilets. Armed security. Zeke's has only one cradle, so if it's occupied the only other option is to secure alongside his jetty and wait for a tide that is low enough so you can do some work.
