<div class="hello"><div><p>Palawan is a beautiful, underdeveloped island lying west of the Visayas. This long, narrow island is fringed with white sandy beaches and there is a rich diversity of wildlife in the mountainous jungle which cover this most attractive destination.</p>
<p>Puerto Princesa lies approximately in the middle of the east coast.</p>
<p>Position 09°50.3'N, 118°50.4'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines?rc=Formalities">Philippines Formalities</a></b> for full details of clearing into and out of the Philippines, including Fees.</p>
<p>Immigration is situated on Rizal Ave, near the airport on the second floor of a nondescript house along the main road (right hand side towards the airport – small signpost). Some of the tricycles cabbies know where it is.</p>
<p>Customs is located opposite the Pilot Elementary school just off Manola Street, in another anonymous house. The tricycle cabbies mostly know where it is. The officials are all very helpful. Customs is responsible for local regional clearance only and do not always expect private yachts to clear with them, but it proves useful if flying out of the country and then back again.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerta Princesa bay contains the small but very helpful Abanico yacht club, located in the NE corner of the harbour. Look out for the blue roof. They monitor VHF channel 72 and can be reached by phone (see their listing below) and the YC will send out a dinghy to guide you in as there are unmarked reefs in the area.</p>
<p>The anchorage is well protected and secure in 8m over sand/mud, and the yacht club will point out where to anchor. To get to the yacht club requires some care and should not be attempted at night.</p>
<p>See<b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Philippines/cruising-the-palawan-and-calamian-islands"> this cruising report from <strong>MV Solita</strong></a></b> for information about other anchorages around Palawan.</p>
<p>Take care of your dinghy and outboard and secure them properly at all times. There have been thefts here in the past.</p>

      Advisable to give call on VHF 72 for guidance into the anchorage, service boat is there until 5 PM. The Club report that Cmap and others do not work properly according to yachts who tried to get to the anchorage on their own. Local charts (large scale Puerto Princesa) are useful, but go slowly.<br>
The yacht club charges 500 peso a week access fee (the website has a complete listing of most fees). Safe dinghy dock. In the bar and grill, hot simple meals are served and usually a Sunday buffet.
