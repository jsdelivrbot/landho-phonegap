<div class="hello"><div><p>Clearance is possible at Batangas Port. The only fee that appears to be charged is by the special quarantine doctor (500 pesos/person). On arrival at 
Batangas for clearance, go first to the Customs house near the ferry port and ask for the port quarantine office which is a short walk from the customs house. From the quarantine office, back to customs and then a short ride by jeepney to the provincial capital building for immigration. Only the skipper need attend but be sure to have copies of all ships paperwork (and an official stamp with the ships name is also helpful).</p>

Actively welcomes visiting boats. Launching ramp, moorings, travel hoist, accommodation, restaurant, fuel and internet.
If all moorings full, it is recommended you anchor in the area to the South which has reasonably good holding in sandy mud.  Typhoon moorings are available should you need refuge from approaching storm.
