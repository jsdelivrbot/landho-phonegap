<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Corong Corong:</i> Anchor in 5 to 12m over sand/mud. Ensure the anchor is well dug in as the holding is not so good in some places.</p>
<p><i>El Nido</i> : You can anchor here in 4 to 5m but the town is more crowded with tourist. .</p>
<p>Which anchorage to choose will depend on the wind direction.</p>
