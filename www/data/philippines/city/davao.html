<p><span>It is the only area in the Philippines that is typhoon-free.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Although other parts of <span>Mindanao suffer from political unrest, </span>Davao City <span>and Samal </span>are safe places to stop (apart from the usual petty crime).</p>
<p><span>The yacht quarantine anchorage is located 50-100m off the southern Sta. Anna wharf (approximately 07°04.53N, 125°37.74E). It is deep here and is a lee shore anchorage making it a little dangerous with a 0.5-1m SW swell in SW winds and rather uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p>It may be possible to anchor in shallower water closer to the southernmost jetty, but clear of busy ferry access lanes. Quarantine and Customs will come to the boat. Immigration will also visit (they may need to be informed of your arrival).</p>
<p><span>Since the opening of Holiday Ocean View Marina, it is permitted to come in the marina first and clear entrance formalities yourself in Davao City. Coming up along the East side of Samal will give you more room to sail and less current and boat traffic.</span></p>

      The marina facility offers 2 docks (self-adjusting with tides) with a combined total of 56 berths. Each berth can fit yachts up to 50 feet LOA. The end of the docks can fit longer yachts up to 100 ft LOA. Each dock has electric connection 220Vac-30A - 60Hz (small fee) as well as water connection (included) . Fuel service is available. The marina entrance is closed with a wave breaker so very little swell is ever felt inside the marina. Entrance and berthing maximum depth is about 12 feet.<br>

Contact marina staff prior to arrival to open the gate and provide mooring assistance.<br>

Dry docking space for over 20 boats. Haul-out is done for vessels up to 60 ft LOA, 28ft beam, 7ft draft and 20 tons. There is one slipway for hauling and launching vessels using a trailer system. Boats are first blocked in the water and pulled out slowly and safely by cable.
