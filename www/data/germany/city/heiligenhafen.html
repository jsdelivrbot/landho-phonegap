<p>Keep clear of the commercial/fishing port on your port side and head for the huge marina.</p>

<p>In the main yacht harbour <i>(see photo courtesy of Alan Wilson)</i>, which has box berths throughout, berth in any space on piers 2 to 12 that has a green card showing. Piers 1a, 1b &amp; 1c are reserved for charter boats &amp; sailing schools, although spaces are usually available except on Fridays &amp; Saturdays, when the crews change. There are no specific visitors' berths and space may be hard to find.</p>
<p><span></span><span>The harbourmaster's office is opposite pier 6: payment for berthing is required in advance, not on departure. Good English may be spoken, depending on who is on duty. </span></p>
