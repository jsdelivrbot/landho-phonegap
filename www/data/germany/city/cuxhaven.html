<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruxhaven is a busy port on the southern shore of the estuary of the river Elbe. It is on Germany's North Sea coast.</p>
<p>The Elbe is the busy entrance for the port of Hamburg, and great care must be taken if crossing the shipping lanes here. The town itself, once clear of the marina, has character and is worth exploring. It is a popular stop for both land-based visitors and yachts on their way to Helgoland.</p>
<p>Position 53° 51.5'N, 8° 42.4'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a big marina here, to the north of the main port entrance and another, City Marina, through the lock.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another small marina. This is the Amerika Hafen in which there are berths run by the small yacht club. It is a cheaper alternative to the marinas with friendly staff and an Engish speaking manager.</p>
<p>Amerika Hafen is the forth entrance to sta'bd when approaching from the sea (i.e. the basin beyond the one leading into the town). The yacht club marina is in the NW corner of this basin.</p>
