<div class="hello"><div><p>This port can be entered in all conditions. When entering from sea, it should be done from the west via Ems. Entering from the northeast is dangerous without local knowledge.</p>
<p>Watch out for commercial vessels and high-speed ferries.</p>
<p>The Yachthaven, "Port Henry", is first harbour to port. Exposed in strong southerlies. The entrance is shallow, so be aware of the depth.</p>
<p>There are also visitors' berths in Burkana Hafen, second harbour to port. Visiting yachts moor alongside large pontoons 1, 2 or 3 in harbour. Deep, with room for large yachts. Uncomfortable in southerlies.</p>
<p>There is a steam railway which takes you into the town.</p>
