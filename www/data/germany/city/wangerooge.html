<div class="hello"><div><p>Approaches - tall Wangerooge Lighthouse and old tower (Westurm) are on W end of the island. When entering to harbour from the sea, watch out for the stonewall (partly submerged) at the west end of the island. It is marked with a buoy at the end, which is really close to the approach channel.</p>
<p>From offshore Harle Lt buoy enter the buoyed Harle Channel (position of buoys changed regularly). Enter last half of flood (entry not advised in strong onshore winds) The harbour is at SW tip of island. Mole ends marked with F.R. and F.G. on similarly coloured beacons. Moles cover at HW when only beacons  are visible. Keep  W in final part of approach, near the D4 red buoy and W mole. Final approach partially marked with port hand withies.</p>
<p>Strong S or SW'lies, especially at HW, cause difficulties in the harbour. Yachts must not raft more than two deep. Guest Berthing is normally of the E side of the harbour - depth at times 1m when yachts may touch bottom at LW. Larger yachts can request a berth on the ferry berth on the west side. Stay clear of lifeboat pontoon in main harbour. Harbour uncomfortable at HW in strong winds from SE through SW. </p>
<p>Access is HW +/-2 hrs. Depths in the E part of the harbour are 1.3 to 1.8m.</p>
<p>If able to dry out, a good spot is at the southeast end or south of the village.
This is reasonably safe in northern winds. South of the poles is good sandy ground; further to the west it becomes pretty muddy...not too nice.</p>
<p>Provisions, some chandlery, launderette, a bank, and several restaurants are available in the village, which is quite a way from the port.</p>
