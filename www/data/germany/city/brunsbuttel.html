<div class="hello"><div><p>Good shelter in Alter Hafen (Old Port marina), which is a drying harbour with access 3hr +/- HW. It is just north of the locks.</p>
<p>A lock gives access to the canal and the Kanal-Yachthafen which is on the north side of the large Neue locks. It gets very crowded in season and due to the amount of canal traffic, it is not a peaceful berth, but useful.</p>
<p>There is a second yacht haven about half a mile further along the canal.</p>
<p>There are no moorings in the waiting area for the canal.</p>
<p>The town has a hospital, banks, post office, provision shops and a train station.</p>
<p>Last updated December 2013.</p></div></div>
