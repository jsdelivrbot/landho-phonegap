<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying 45 m north of the mainland, in the area known as the German Bight, Helgoland consists of two islands. It is a tax-free region and also, due to its clean air and mild climate, a health and holiday resort. Cars are not normally allowed on the island. The first one was a police car in January 2006.</p>
Position 54°10′57″N, 7°53′07″E.

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour provides good protection but can get very crowded in the season. It is possible, with permission from Port Control, to anchor in the SW part of Vorhafen.</p>
<p>Coming from the south it is very easy to get into the southern port (Neastport is for locals only) - especially at night.</p>
<p>If reachable (i.e. due to tides), Helgoland is always a good and safe choice in really really bad weather.</p>
