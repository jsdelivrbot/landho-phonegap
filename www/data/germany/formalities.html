<div><p>It is only necessary to complete immigration procedures when arriving in or departing from Germany from outside the EU. This has to be done at a community port where there is a Bundespolizri Office. In small ports there may not be an office (call the Head Office in Hamburg on +49 40 66995050 to check if in doubt).</p>
<p>Passports and 2 crew lists must be produced. 1 crew list will be stamped and has to be shown when signing out of Germany at your last port.</p>
<p>On arrival, the Q flag must be flown, unless arriving from an EU or Scandinavian country. Yachts arriving from a non-EU country must report to Customs (Zoll) at one of the ports of entry.</p>
<p>Helgoland is not a port of entry and clearance formalities cannot be completed there.</p>
<p><span>No formalities are required for yachts departing for or arriving from Poland.</span></p>
<p>Duty-free stores must be declared to Customs. Immigration must be cleared on arrival and departure.</p>
<p>Laboe, at the entrance of the Kiel fjord, is the Customs clearance point for yachts entering or leaving Germany via Kiel.</p>

<div><p>Yachts must carry their original registration document, insurance policy and ship's radio licence.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>There are strict anti-pollution regulations in force throughout Germany, but particularly in the Baltic Sea. The disposal of garbage anywhere in the Baltic is forbidden. Degradable foodstuff can only be disposed of overboard more than 12 miles from shore. Special containers are provided in all ports for the disposal of garbage and used oils.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Holding Tanks.</span> Boats are required to be equipped with waste tanks although there are exemptions for all vessels which are less and 10.5m long or less than 2.8m wide or built before 1980. Other exemptions may exist including foreign vessesl whose normal home port is outside Germany so long as they are only visiting Germany for a season.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Navigation:</span> When motor-sailing, a black cone with its apex pointing downwards must be displayed and when at anchor the black ball must be hoisted - failure to do so can result in instant fines.</p>
<p>Yachts must carry on board the German collision regulations (Seeschiffahrtsstrasse-nordnung) and the Kiel Canal Rules. The latter can be obtained at the Canal.</p>
<p>Regulations state that any vessel over 15 tons is considered a merchant ship and must carry a pilot through most state waterways unless the skipper has a Master's Certificate, though it appears that in practice this is not applied to yachts.</p>
<p><span>Children under 15 years may not steer a vessel under way in German waters and, in certain rivers, this minimum age is 21 or 23. Motor boats, and sometimes sailing yachts, require special permission to use some inland waterways.</span></p></div>
