<p>Germany utilizes the GSM cell phone standard, which is by far the predominant cellular communication standard. By far the most economical solution would be to have a GSM phone suitable for overseas that accepts the local SIM card.
It is possible to purchase an unlocked GSM tri-band phone through vendors other than the major carriers,then insert a German SIM card into this phone and take advantage of the local rates. Purchase a prepaid German SIM card with call credit already incorporated, and if necessary, add more talk time to the SIM card. One caveat is that to purchase a German SIM card in Germany, proof of residency is required.  </p>
