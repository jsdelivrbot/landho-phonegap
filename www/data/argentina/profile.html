<div><ul>
<li>Not many cruising yachts brave the elements to visit Argentina, but those who do are attracted to the challenging wilderness of the Magellan Straits and Tierra del Fuego. </li>
<li>Yachts coming from the north can get a taste of Argentina in Buenos Aires and the resorts in the Rio de la Plata estuary, where most yachting facilities are concentrated. There are several resorts with yacht clubs in the Rio de la Plata estuary, such as San Isidro and Olivos. </li>
<li>There are only a few ports along Argentina's long coastline and there is little to see between the Rio de la Plata and the Straits of Magellan, with the notable exception of Mar del Plata, which has a thriving sailing community and facilities to match.</li>
<li>Only basic facilities are available at Puerto Madryn and Puerto Deseado. Provisioning outside of the Buenos Aires area is adequate and for yachts heading south a convenient place to reprovision is at Río Gallegos, capital of Santa Cruz. Argentina is however getting more expensive, and if heading south Chile is a cheaper option for stocking up (apart from wine and meat).</li>
<li>Visiting yachts should tread carefully when clearing into Argentina as many have suffered investigations by Customs for possible infractions. This is on-going, however using a port agent avoids many potential problems. See reports adjacent for further details.</li>
<li>(New 2011) Every boat must check in on a daily basis with the Argentine Coastguard by a pre-agreed method (E-mail, satellite phone, SSB or VHF frequency) while sailing between Argentine ports. Get a written contact sheet and log your attempts to call to avoid being detained and possible fines by the coastguard on arrival at your destination. Further information <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Members/sue/R2011-12-11-1">here</a>.</li>
<li>All vessels intending to sail to or from the Falklands, South Georgia and South Orkneys must apply for and obtain permission from the Argentine government or they will be fined $7000USD upon arrival in Argentina, or risk impoundment of vessel. All vessels must apply, cruisers or charter vessels. Fines are even applied for reasons of Force Majeure.</li>

<div><p>Cruisers report that security in Tierra del Fuego is just simply not an issue. Many never lock their boats and dinghys with outboards can be left at the jetty without any problems.<br>

<div><p>The Argentine climate ranges from subtropical in the north to cold temperate in Tierra del Fuego. The central zone is temperate, while Buenos Aires is hot and humid, the summer months December to February being the hottest. In Rio de la Plata the prevailing winds in summer are easterly, while SW winds are more common in winter. They are often accompanied by pamperos, violent SW squalls that affect most of Argentina's coastal waters.</p>
