<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of the country see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Argentina?rc=Formalities">Argentina Formalities</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Prefectura Naval require notice of ETA on VHF Ch.16 prior to arrival. Boats should proceed to the marina, where both Yacht Club Argentino and Club Nautico are located. Either Club will help with formalities.</p>
<p>Yachts are cleared by Customs, Prefectura Naval and Immigration. If arriving from a foreign port, Health Control must also visit the boat (fee charged for this service).</p>
<p>When clearing out, the captain must again visit the Prefectura Naval office.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard (Prefectura Naval), Customs (Aduana) and Immigration are all housed in the same street (turn left out of YCA or Club Nautico, follow curved road, bear left at end of truck park, pass entry to fishing dock, and buildings you need are about 300m on the right).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Following dredging works, there is now at least 8m of depth at the harbour mouth. </span></p>
<p>The two Yacht Clubs which accept foreign yachts, share the inner basin of the large harbour (Puerto de Yachting). Visiting sailors are very welcome at both clubs and offer a week's free berthing.</p>
<p>The facilities in this large fishing port are very good, including excellent provisioning. There are good repair facilities but limited haulout options. This is the best place to prepare the boat for a southbound voyage and it is also a good base from which to visit inland Argentina as it has frequent flights to Buenos Aires and other destinations.</p>
<p>If arriving at night, when the swing bridge is closed, call CNMdP on VHF channel 71. They will send out a launch to guide you in.</p>
<p>There are waiting buoys outside the bridge.</p>
