<div class="hello"><div><p>Ushuaia (pronounced [u'swaia]) is sometimes considered to be the southernmost city in the world. It is located in a wide bay on the southern coast of the island of Tierra del Fuego, guarded on the north by the Martial mountain range and on the south by the Beagle Channel. Ushuaia is surrounded by Magellanic subpolar forests that give the landscape a magnificent greenness.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into and out of the country see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Argentina?rc=Formalities">Argentina Formalities</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Port control should be contacted on Channel 16 as one enters the harbour. An  immigration official will be sent to visit the boat. For customs it is necessary  to visit the main office in the commercial harbour.</p>
<p>Customs are now open:<br/><span>Monday to Friday: 0700-1800</span><br/><span>Sat, Sun and holidays: 0800-1100 &amp; 1600-1900</span> <br/>These hours do have a tendency to change quite frequently.</p>
<p>Fees only apply for  clearance at weekends or public holidays. A yacht may be fined for not clearing in  immediately.</p>
<p>Any yacht whose registration papers state their gross weight is in excess of 50  Tonnes is required to use a harbour pilot and also a shipping agent. This can be  expensive.</p>
<p>Those who intend to sail north through the Beagle Channel must also clear in and  out with the Chilean Navy at Puerto Williams, if continuing into Chilean waters.  Those who need Chilean visas can obtain them at the Chilean consulate in  Ushuaia, situated on the corner of Calle Maipu and Kuanip.</p>
<p>For cruising the Beagle Channel as far as Staten Island, no zarpe is required but  the Prefectura must be notified before you leave of the details of your trip.</p>
<p>Prefectura Naval Argentinian Coast Guard, Tel. +54 (2901)435805.</p>
<p><!-- HIDE THIS TEXT - FOR NOW Due to the fact that an increasing number of charter yachts are visiting Ushuaia  every year without permits, the Ushuaia Maritime Authorities have introduced a  new regulation which means that each time a yacht changes or takes on new crew  that are not relatives of the captain, the Authority requires two Argentine  witnesses to declare the crews are not passengers but friends. This rule is  enforced also for private yachts and is only applied in Ushuaia.--></p>
<p>Customs in Ushuaia continue to be erratic with their charging of  fines/taxes. However, they state:</p>
<p><strong>No vessel may be left unattended in Argentine waters without the written  application to, and consent of, the local customs authority.</strong></p>
<p>A power of attorney must be granted to a resident living within a certain radius  from the boat and a notarized letter produced to communicate this information to  Customs and Coast Guard. The cost of this is about $100. The penalty for  infringement is 1% of the value of the vessel.</p>
<p><strong>No vessel may breach the terms of their conditions of entry into the country  by using their boats for commercial activities while in Argentina.</strong></p>
<p>If a yacht is deemed to be chartering in Argentina waters by Customs, they are  liable to a fine of 30% of the value of the vessel. Remember, even if you make a  voyage in Argentina waters with people paying costs aboard, you could then be  construed to be a charter vessel.</p>
<p><strong>Further Possible Fines:-</strong><br/>Currently, all is reported to be quiet with the Customs here. However, yachts should be aware that in the past the local Customs have come up with all sorts of ways one could be considered to  be breaking the rules. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Modifying or repairing the boat, purchasing goods or equipment locally, leaving  the vessel and traveling overland, even purchasing fuel can be considered an  infraction without going through the laborious process of completing paperwork.  Any infraction could lead to boat arrest and a spot fine of 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Before Sailing to Argentina</strong>, check with the Argentine consulate with  regards to what one needs to do with regard to exit and entry papers, leaving  the boat, hauling your vessel, having work done on your vessel, or anything that  may create a potential problem with Customs. If you can get this in writing,  even better.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It must be emphasized that Ushuaia is a very windy and insecure place to have a yacht.</p>
<p>Visiting boats usually moor at the ASAFyN dock (Water Sports Association) on the east side of the harbour. However the old Club Nautico on the other side of the bay closer to town, is now operating again with a new jetty and rates are reported to be a great deal cheaper than those at ASAFyN. </p>
<p>The AFASyN wharf (60 metres) was completely repaired in 2009 and raised 50 cms to improve functionality during high tides. However, it is necessary for boats to raft up and in high winds this causes problems.</p>
<p>There are mooring buoys available but they may be unreliable.</p>

      This club has become the real yacht club of Ushuaia and has a lively social life.

There is also a small workshop for use by visitors (for a fee) and members. In addition to the dock, there are mooring buoys which may be available. The slipway can haul boats out up to 20 tons and part of the dock nearest the shore is shallow enough to allow drying out between tides.
