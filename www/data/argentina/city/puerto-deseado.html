<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of the fast tidal stream at the entrance.</p>
<p>The channel is well marked. The small bay on the northern bank, formed by a peninsular of land to the east and a breakwater to the west, offers the best protection. Take note of the tidal range as a large part of this bay dries at LW springs.</p>
<p>It may be possible to find an anchorage further up the Ria. Comments below re. other docking options from a cruiser who visited here in November 2015 are also helpful.</p>
