<p>All vessels over 50 tons are required to employ a pilot (at a cost of  US$500) when ever entering or leaving the harbour.</p>
<p>Port control should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 for instructions on where to berth for clearance in the busy commercial harbour.</p>
<p>All formalities are normally completed ashore. Offices should be visited in the following order - Immigration, Coastguard and Customs. All are within 300 metres of one another.</p>
<p><span>Sufficient time should be allowed for the long trip up the Plate River. A good place to stop on arrival is at the Yacht Club Argentino, reached via a buoyed channel. Formalities are completed at Prefectura Naval.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Both Yacht Club Argentino and Yacht Club Puerto Madero have marinas most conveniently located to visit the Argentinian capital. Visitors are offered one-week's free docking at YC Argentina, with the first night free at YC Puerto Madero. Note, if you use the 1 week free offer at the headquarters of the city, you cannot use it at the YC headquarters north or Mar Del Plata.</p>
<p>The bridge to Puerto Madero opens every hour on the hour for entering and exiting boats, if requested at least 30 minutes in advance. The request can be made to marina personnel before exiting, or via VHF 71 when returning. All yachts departing Puerto Madero must sign a log book at the marina office (on the dock), stating where you are going. This rule is for all boats, whether local or foreign flagged.</p>
<p>The most welcoming Club for foreign boats is Club de Veleros Barlovento. It offers alot of services and is located in the middle of a nautical area, so is ideal for parts and labour. It does require a local insurance policy, but is cheaper than all the other clubs or marinas.</p>
<p>There are good facilities available and also a good range of marine supplies in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Yacht Club Argentino San Fernando has excellent facilities, however it is a private club and limited to visitors, plus it´s 20 miles up-river from the capital. There is a boatyard offering an excellent range of services and other marinas in this same area.</p>
<p>North Buenos Aires has a large and very friendly sailing comunity. Club Nautico San Isidro offers a free marina, travelift and services for fiberglass, steel and wooden boats. <span>Club Nautico Sudeste</span><span> no longer receives foreign boats.</span></p>
<p>The trip to Rio LuJan, where the majority of the yachts are kept, can be achieved in two ways: via the canal Emilio Mitre then canal Honda leading to canal de Vinculacion which ends at Rio Lujan; or the costal passage. This can be very shallow depending on tides, wind and the river.</p>
<p>In the area San Isidro, San Martine and San Fernando there are dozens of clubs and thousands of boats and then there is the Tigre area as well. Here it is possible to organise a berth by calling into each club as you move up the river or best anchor on the Island side of the channel and take the dinghy, the road system is such that it is very complex to do this by road.</p>
