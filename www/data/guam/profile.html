<ul>
<li>Guam is the largest and most populous island of Micronesia, a modern, Americanised metropolis and home to an important US military base.</li>
<li>It is geographically the southernmost of the Mariana Islands, but forms a separate unit from the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. Guam is an Unincorporated Territory of the United States. Guam's close relations with the USA, and its role as a crossroads and distribution centre for the rest of Micronesia because of its air links, makes it rather different from the rest of the Pacific.</li>
<li>Cruising yachts will indeed find in Guam a contrasting atmosphere to the one they have experienced in other islands. The pace is faster, the buildings taller and everything can be fixed if one is prepared to pay the price. Guam is used by many American sailors as a long-term base, especially as US citizens can work in Guam without a permit.</li>
