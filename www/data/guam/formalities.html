<p><strong>US visa regulations are in force. All nationals, except those of the USA, are required to have a visa in advance of arrival.</strong></p>
<p>The visa waiver scheme does NOT apply when arriving by yacht.</p>
<p>See<strong> <a href="Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Noonsite.com/USA/Immigration</a></strong></p>
<p>It has been reported that a visa-on-arrival may be provided (at a much higher cost) but this is not certain, and those arriving without a visa may either be refused entry or only be granted a few days stay at most, and have to remain on board. There is a $200 fine for arriving without a visa.</p>
<p>It is possible that citizens of the following countries <strong>may</strong> be allowed entry  for 45 days under the via waiver scheme:-<br/> Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. This visa waiver does not permit entry into the USA.</p>
