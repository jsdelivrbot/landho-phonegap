<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There are only two places to anchor in Apra Harbour - off the Marianas Yacht Club (see below) or inside Port of Refuge. </span></p>
<p><span>The anchorage off the MYC is a little exposed, but otherwise fine. Both the anchorage and moorings are managed by the Marianas Yacht Club. If using a mooring, check its security as they are subject to chafe.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of the high frequency of typhoons, arrangements have been made in Apra Harbour for small boats seeking shelter during a typhoon. The Port of Refuge is located in Piti Channel, which can be reached by boats with a maximum draft of 8 feet. The area is reputed to be well sheltered in any kind of winds.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Port of Refuge has no facilities other than water. There is no public transport and a taxi to town costs around $70. Hiring a car is a better option and can be hired for $30 per day (plus $15 per day insurance).</span></p>
<p>Yachts must stay well clear of the Naval Harbour, which is situated within Apra Harbour. It is possible a yacht might be boarded by a naval patrol when entering or transiting the harbour.</p>

<p>MYC welcomes visiting sailors and yachtsmen from around the World. <span>The Club, located on Dry Dock Point south of the commercial port, can be used by visitors.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Club manages a safe anchorage within Sasa Bay with moorings for members and guest yachts. Guest mooring and registration fees are gratuitous for the first three days, thereafter there is a charge of $7 per day, payable weekly, in advance.  Options of alternate membership categories are available for long term usage with assignment of membership rates.  MYC has up to eight moorings available for guest yachts, all of which have been replaced within the last 18 months.  MYC welcomes cruising yachts to their private club.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The reef around the MYC moorings can be hard to see and markers are routinely blown away by typhoons. It is advisable to call the club for help with guiding the yacht in.</span></p>

      There are no walk-ashore berths, but the club has some moorings available for visitors. Tender parking is available at the club premises. The club also offers phone, wi-fi, potable water, showers, toilets, garbage pick up, barbecue facilities, large covered lanai, and parking.<br>
Notify the club of your ETA and, if possible, someone will meet you outside of the anchorage to escort you in. It is not recommended to enter the anchorage after dark.
