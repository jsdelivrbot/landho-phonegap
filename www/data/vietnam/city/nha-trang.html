<div class="hello"><div><p>This east coast port is reported to be a better point of entry as the officials are more used to foreign boats as this port has been used in the past for the finish of a race from Hong Kong. </p>
<p>Immigration authorities insist yachts anchor in front of their window, which is not a comfortable spot. It may be possible to obtain permission to anchor instead downwind from Vinland, the "Disney style" island on the other side. The owners of this resort may not permit this, though.</p>
<p>To cruise the immediate area, you must give the authorities a detailed plan of where you will be sailing during that day when the office opens and you must be back before it closes.</p>
<p>Using an agent makes clearance much easier.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The area should be approached with great caution as it is encumbered by shallows. A channel leads into the port, and visiting boats are normally asked to anchor nearly one mile offshore.</p>
<p>The Sunsail charter base no longer appears to be in operation.</p>
<p>A water taxi to the shore costs $10. It leaving the boat to travel, a watchman must be employed and this can cost $30/night.</p>
<p>Harbour dues are payable in each port of entry you visit. Ports are very busy with small fishing boats used for tourism (no docking space) and the bays are busy with boat traffic of all kinds.</p>
