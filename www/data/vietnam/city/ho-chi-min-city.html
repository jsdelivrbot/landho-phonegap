<div class="hello"><div><p>The Coast Guard will probably intercept the vessel when it enters territorial waters and an attempt should be made to advise them on HF radio of one's destination and ETA. The port authorities should be contacted on Channel 16 before proceeding into the port. </p>
<p>Anchoring in the river is prohibited in the area close to the city. Port Control will give directions where to proceed. The port office and customs are located in the northern part of the commercial harbour.</p>
