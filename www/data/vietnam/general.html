<p>Mobile Phones and SIM cards in Vietnam You will almost certainly be able to use your existing mobile phone on in Vietnam, assuming it is a GSM SIM card model. You should check to see if it's locked to your home network but even then, it's cheap and straightforward to have it unlocked in Vietnam, meaning you'll then be able to use it on any network in the World.</p>
<p>Pre-paid SIM cards are available everywhere in Vietnam and are easy to obtain. There is a law that states you should produce a Vietnam ID card when buying a SIM card but this only applies to Vietnamese nationals and does not affect foreigners.</p>
<p>The three big players in the cellular market are Vinafone, Viettel and Mobiphone.</p>
