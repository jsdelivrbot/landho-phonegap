<p><strong>Adriatic Pilot - Croatia,Slovenia, Montenegro, East Coast of Italy, Albania</strong><br/> By Trevor and Dinah Thompson <br/> Publisher Imray, Laurie, Norie, Wilson Ltd (6th Edition April 2012)<br/> ISBN 13: 978-1846233333<br/> Adriatic Pilot is the standard guide to Croatia and the neighbouring countries of Slovenia, Montenegro and Albania and now celebrates 20 years of publication.  It also provides coverage of the eastern coast of Italy, and is the only guide to the Venice Lagoon and harbours adjacent to Istria, and at present is the only book that covers the entire Adriatic region in a single volume.</p>
<p><strong>777 Harbours and Anchorages - Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Albania</strong><br/> By Anna and Rod Bailey<br/> Publisher Edizioni Magnamare (6th edition 2014)<br/>  777 contains detailed, up-to-date information on more than 1000 ports and anchorages, as well as the technical details which are of most interest to pleasure yachters: the phone numbers of the Marinas and Harbourmaster's offices, the facilities available, mooring facilities, where to buy provisions. Besides the main harbours, there are charts showing solitary, nearly unknown coves; this result was achieved thanks to the patience and precision of the author. Slso contains a few hints and coves which were added to the original book, thanks to the contributions by editors, Piero and Silvia Magnabosco.</p></div>
