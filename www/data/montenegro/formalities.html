<div><p>Yachts approaching Montenegro coast should expect to be intercepted by naval craft patrolling the area.</p>
<p>VHF Channel 16 should be monitored permanently and, if contacted by a naval vessel, the radio operator of the yacht will be expected to give the following information: name of yacht, international callsign, flag, port of registration, last port of call, destination. The name of the owner and the general description of the cargo is sometimes also requested.</p>
<p><strong>In all cases yachts must proceed to the nearest Port of Entry and anounce their arrival to the Harbour Master at either <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Montenegro/Bar">Bar</a> or <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Montenegro/Kotor">Kotor</a> through the Coast Radio Station ("Barradio") using VHF channel 16. Do not go to any other  port prior to clearing in at either of the above 2 ports, or you will be fined.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts must purchase a cruising permit (a "vignette"), valid for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or one year. This has to be purchased at the Harbour Master's office. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Montenegro?rc=Formalities#Fees"><b>fees</b></a> below for details. There is a fee for clearance and allow half a day for formalities.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Visiting yachts, for whatever reason (fuel, water etc.) will be required to clear-in and will be obliged to pay for a cruising permit.</p>
