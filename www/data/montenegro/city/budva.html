<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is in the western corner of the large bay fronting the town. It is composed of a marina and a town quay; both operated by the marina. Mooring is med-style and expensive.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor off the town, but the bay is open to the south, although the holding is good. The only place to get ashore with a dinghy is at the Marina, who charge a daily fee for anchored yachts to do so.</p>
