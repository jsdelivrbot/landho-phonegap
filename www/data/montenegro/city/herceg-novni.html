<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Kotor (Boka Kotorska), this is a busy ferry port and tourist town. The harbour is noisy and suffers from the wash of the many tripper boats. </p>
<p>It is town known for its Mimosa trees and numerous steps. Herceg Novi looks like one big botanical garden. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is exposed to the south.</p>
<p>Berth on the inner side of the harbour wall where there is space, water and electricity included in the daily fee.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor west of the harbour but a bright anchor light is necessary due to the large number of ferries which arrive late into the night. Good holding in 5 to 6m in sand and mud.</p>
