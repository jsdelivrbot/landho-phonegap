<div class="hello"><div><p>Tucked into the extreme southern end of Kotorski Zaliv in the Gulf of Kotor, this walled town is a delight to visit. The ‘Old Town’ in Kotor is the best preserved town centre from the Middle Ages in the Mediterranean, and is typical of those in the region that were built in the 12th and 14th centuries. It is a World Heritage site.</p>

<p>Berth at the Customs Dock for clearing in. Harbourmaster and Customs offices are on the quay. Cruisers have reported however that it is difficult to hail the Harbourmaster on VHF for berthing instructions and the Customs Dock is often busy with cruise ships.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour, located in Boka Kotorska bay, is right under the walls of the old city.</p>
<p>Kotor Marina is located at the SE end of the main dock, identified by a small sign. The pontoons have lines tailed to the dock, marina staff direct you to a berth. Will often be crowded at weekend in the season.</p>
<p>You can also berth in the river entrance, near the harbour office, if the dock is free and not busy with cruise ships. It is quiet and sheltered here but can be subject to a strong current.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage 7m north of the town.</p>
<p>Another berth may be found at the small village of Muo, a mile from Kotor. It has a quay and there is a bus service into Kotor.</p>
<p>The Porto Montenegro, l<span>ocated in the Bay of Kotor, near Tivat city, is aimed primarily at superyachts. It is visible by the tall red and white striped crane located in the middle of its main dock.</span></p>
