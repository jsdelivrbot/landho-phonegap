<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../montenegro-pics/montenegro_perast_kotor/@@images/image/preview"/>Perast has <span>a small town quay right in the centre of everything. Depth of approximately 4 meters and no charge for berthing.</span></p>
<p><span>Note however that yachts can only stay between 18.00 and 09.00 as tourist boats use the quay all day. There is no<span> water or electricity.</span> Worth an overnight stay if you don't mind an early morning. </span></p>
<p><span>The quay is convenient for tavernas, there is a mini market, post office etc.</span></p>
<p><span>It's worth taking the ferry to Our Ladies Island to visit the church and museum there.</span></p>
