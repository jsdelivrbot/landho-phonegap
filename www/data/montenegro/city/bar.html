<div class="hello"><div><p>An industrial town and Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Montenegro/?rc=Formalities">Montenegro Formalities</a></b><span> for full details on clearing into and out of the country.</span></p>
<p>Yachts should call harbour control on Channel 16 before proceeding to the marina for clearance.</p>
<p>At the marina many of the officials will visit the boat there. The remainder being only 3 minutes walk away.</p>
<p>To check in one first has to go to the Harbour Master’s (Kapotinieri) office. This is not easy to find. Leave the customs building and walk past the marina car park entrance hut. Continue down a narrow path to the left of a bar/café through some trees. The office is on the south side of the first building up a short flight of stairs. It displays no flags.</p>
<p>The Harbour Master will copy all the ships documents and skippers will need to fill in a four carbonised crew list. This then needs to be taken to the police and customs and then back to the Harbour Master who issues you with your vignette. The Harbour Master will give you a ticket for berthing booked and this needs to be taken to the post office to be paid.</p>
<p>Ensure that all the paperwork is correctly completed and you are issued with a cruising permit.</p>
<p>All officials are reported as being extremely pleasant and helpful. From here you can clear out of the country to visit Albania.</p>
