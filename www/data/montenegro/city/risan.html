<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth in the harbour, which lies in front of the gardens. Depending on the wind direction, berth where possible on either side near the entrance as it shallows further in.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor outside in 6 to 8m, but the bottom is very soft mud and the anchor may not hold..</p>
