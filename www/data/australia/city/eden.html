<div class="hello"><div><p>This city is on the northern shore of the magnificent harbour of Twofold Bay. It is a principal commercial port of the south coast of Australia as well as a major fishing town.</p>
<p>Originally this was a whaling town, but now it is a centre for whale-watching. Many species can be seen just off shore here during their annual migration (September to November).</p>
<p>This is a good point from which to explore the Gippsland Lakes, Australia's largest inland waterway. This is an area that is well worth visiting and possible even with a larger yacht. Visit <a href="http://www.nineofcups.com/Australia_New_South_Wales.html/"><strong>www.nineofcups.com/NewSouthWales</strong></a> for more an interesting report.</p>
