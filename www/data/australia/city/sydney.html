<div class="hello"><div><p>Sailing into this harbour must be a landmark on any cruising itinerary.</p>
<p>Note that there is a 15 knot maximum speed limit in Sydney Harbour for vessels travelling under the Sydney Harbour Bridge and all vessels will not be permitted to stop or drift under the Bridge. The restriction applies in a safety zone 600m east of the bridge and 700m to the west. NSW Maritime boating officers patrol and monitor the zone, and penalties apply for non compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong></p>
<p>After passing under the bridge, there is a designated "small craft" anchorage on the northern side, at Balls Head Bay. Visiting yachts can anchor here for extended periods (max. of 2 months). Whilst facilities are limited, access to the city is cheap and easy from nearby Wollstonecraft railway station. Unfortunately, the anchorage has a reputation for a foul bottom, and is uncomfortably open to southerly winds.</p>
<p>Blackwattle and Rozelle Bays are good places to anchor in Sydney to get access to the Central Business District, Blackwattle Bay being the quietest with the least wash from passing commercial vessels. There are three designated areas for anchoring. The anchorages most closely located to the fish market dinghy dock are the most popular and also the most crowded. The farthest anchorage area, whilst only three tenths of a mile further from the dingy dock, is much quieter and has a very nice park only a few metres away. Both bays have good holding and are protected from all wind directions. The downside is the traffic noise from the bridge and bits of junk on the bottom, plus the mosquitos at sunset. Long-term visits are discouraged - Waterways (Sydney) office is located in Rozelle Bay and will advise on current policy.</p>
<p>There are also a number of public moorings available in the harbour (Athol Bay, Sugarloaf Bay, Bantry Bay). These are heavily used during the summer months, especially on weekends, so it's advisable to arrive early.</p>
<p><strong>Marinas</strong></p>
<p>There are a large number of marinas around Sydney Harbour and the ones included here usually have room for visitors.</p>
