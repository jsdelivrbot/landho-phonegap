<div class="hello"><div><p>Work commenced in October 2011 for a new $25 million boat harbour at Flat Rock, about four kilometres south of the town of Augusta, in Flinders Bay. A sheltered boating facility was very much needed here.</p>
<p><span>The project included the construction of two breakwaters built to create a protected harbour basin accommodating a four-lane boat launching ramp; two boat-holding jetties; and a service jetty.</span></p>
<p><span>Construction was completed November 2014.</span></p>
<p>Last updated January 2015.</p></div></div>
