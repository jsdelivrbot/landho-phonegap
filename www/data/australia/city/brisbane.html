<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to the Brisbane River is along the west coast of Moreton Bay, towards the southern end. The commercial port is obvious near the river mouth; the city of Brisbane lies about 17 miles upstream. The river bar is deep and may be crossed in any weather conditions or tidal state.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The yacht clearance boarding station is at the Rivergate Marina. This is located just before the first bridge in the Brisbane River. Their website (<a href="http://rivergate.com.au/customs-clearance/" target="_blank">http://rivergate.com.au/customs-clearance/</a>) has <span>detailed information about clearing customs.</span></p>
<p><span><span> It is 30nm from the NE channel to Rivergate Marina, 6 miles further if you come through the NW channel.  Current in the river is strong at Rivergate Marina; you may want to arrive at slack water particularly if short handed. </span></span></p>
<p>Yachts must notify Customs a minimum of 96 hours in advance of arrival. This can be done by: sending an email to  <a href="mailto:yachtreport@customs.gov.au">yachtreport@customs.gov.au</a> ; sending a fax to +61 2 6275 6331; phoning Australian Customs National Communications Centre on telephone number +61 3 9244 8973. Clearance is done by Customs, Immigration and Quarantine. See <a href="Countries/Australia/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Australia/Clearance</strong></a> for full details.</p>
<p>Clearance formalities are performed at Rivergate Marina; yachts must proceed directly to the Customs &amp; Quarantine Berth (indicated by yellow signs) and the marina will organise for all the officials to come to your boat.</p>
<p>Note that this marina is located 10 miles from the city centre, just east of the M1 River Bridge (see view of Rivergate marina below). It is remote with very few facilities close-by.</p>
<p><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/copy_of_BrisbaneRivergatemarina.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/></p>
<p>If you arrive on a weekend, you may have to get cleared in by quarantine which  charges a weekend or after hours fee (approx. double the normal fee). Alternatively, Customs may just lock the gate and leave you there until Monday morning when Quarantine will clear you in (saving you the after hours fee). This is not <span>guaranteed, </span><span>however.</span></p>
<p>The Customs office does not permit anchoring at Mud Island.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The city of Brisbane provides a unique opportunity for visiting yachts to anchor or moor in the heart of a major urban centre. The Brisbane River is navigable by deep-draft vessels the 12 miles up river to the city. Low bridge clearances there restrict further upstream excursions by masted yachts. Note that the river can run at 3kn at times.</p>
<p>There are anchorages along the eastern shore of the river opposite Eagle Street Pier, j<span>ust upstream of the Gateway Bridge on the right hand side of the river,</span> or along the western shore south of the pile moorings at the Botanic Gardens. All anchorages and marinas are affected by ferry wakes throughout the day; however commercial traffic ceases overnight.</p>
<p>This is a very popular port and finding a berth can be quite a challenge. It is advisable to plan ahead if possible. Finding available facilties (water, toilets, showers etc.) is also difficult when anchored in the river.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use a marina further from the city, such as those at Manly (to the south) or Scarborough or Bribie Island to the north.</p>
<p>Whilst Rivergate Marina is the official clearance station, many cruising boats move on after clearing in to a marina closer to the city and facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Security Note -</strong> In the past there have been dinghy thefts reported by boats at the Garden Point Moorings adjacent to downtown Brisbane. Be sure to secure your dinghy and engine at all times.</p>
