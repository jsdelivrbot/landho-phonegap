<div class="hello"><div><p>This little port is tucked up into the northern corner of a bay on the exposed west coast of Tasmania.</p>
<p>It provides a very useful port of refuge, but be advised that the entrance channel into Maquarie Harbour (known as<i> Hell's Gate</i>) is narrow, and has strong tidal flows.</p>
<p><span>Outside Hell’s Gate is a very convenient anchorage called Pilot Bay which is protected from southwest winds, and a good place to wait until conditions are suitable to enter Hell's Gate and Maquarie Harbour.</span></p>
<p>Strahan is a remote and rather isolated community, so facilities are limited.</p>
<p>Position 42° 11'50"S, 145° 12'46"E (Hell's Gate)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Do not attempt to enter the harbour in the dark. Slack water is the best time to enter.</p>
<p>There are many quiet and secluded anchorages within the harbour. Risby Cove at Strahan provides good holding (10m over mud) and shelter in all conditions. Betsy's Bay just north of the town is also a nice spot. Yachts can anchor anywhere off the town.</p>
<p><span>Trevor Norton’s very informative chart of Macquarie Harbour, available at West Coast Charters on Strahan Wharf (<span>03 6471 7422), </span></span><span>shows a number of local treks, in particular across from the harbour to Tasmania’s wild West Coast.</span></p>
