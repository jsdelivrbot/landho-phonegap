<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../australia-pics/ti_post-office/@@images/image/mini"/>Thursday Island (also known locally as just 'T.I') and Horn Island are located off the very northern tip of Queensland in the Torres Strait (between the Australian Mainland and Papua New Guinea). Whilst Horn Island is the larger of the two, TI is more heavily populated and has more services, including Customs and AQIS.</span></p>
<p>TI is a small and friendly place to stop, but it can be very windy here and anchoring is the only option.</p>
<p>Location <span>10° 34.5' S, 142° 12.5' E</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-right" src="../../australia-pics/ti_anchorage-horn-island/@@images/image/preview"/>Port Control (or "Points North") should be contacted on arrival on VHF Ch. 16, 08:30-17:00. </span></p>
<p><span></span>They will either direct you to the Customs dock, or to one of the anchorages (depending on the weather). Customs, Immigration and Quarantine offices are all only a 5 minute walk from the main jetty once you are ashore.</p>
<p>If the anchorage at Thursday Island is too uncomfortable, then it is possible to anchor off Horn Island<i> (see photo)</i> and take the ferry across to Clear in/out.</p>
<p>You have 24 hours to leave after clearing out.</p>

      It is important to speak to Quarantine officers about food restrictions. The Torres Strait area is a strictly controlled marine park, and certain foods cannot be taken from Thursday Island to your next port of call.

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../australia-pics/ti_dinghy-dock-horn-island/@@images/image/preview"/>It can often be windy here, so depending on conditions there are two authorised anchorages to choose from:</span></p>
<p><span>1. To the south of Thursday Island </span>to the east or west of the two main jetties, or<br/><span>2. Opposite, j</span><span>ust off the north west shoreline of Horn Island b</span><span>etween Madge Reef and Horn Island. In SE winds, the Horn Island anchorage provides greater protection. The anchorage west of the wharves has 10m over mud.</span></p>
<p>If you are unsure which would be the best anchorage, contact 'Ports North' for advice. They can be reached on VHF16, or their office can be found just to the north of the northern most town jetty.</p>
<p><span>There is a regular daytime passenger ferry service that operates between TI and Horn Island. TI has far more facilities ashore, including supermarkets and bars.</span></p>
<p>Dinghies can be taken to the jetties at the main wharf on TI, but as always, ensure that both dinghy and engines are padlocked before you leave them.</p>
