<div class="hello"><div><p>The boat harbour here is extremely well sheltered, but small. It is necessary to call ahead regarding availability of a berth or a pile mooring.</p>
<p>There is no anchoring in the harbour, although it is possible outside.</p>
<p>The marina at Airlie Beach provides more facilities, including a fuel berth.</p>
