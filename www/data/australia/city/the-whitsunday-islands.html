<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/d75d729c470843e9a18a0323619b4d62/@@images/image/preview"/>There are many safe anchorages, usually protected by reefs, among The Whitsundays,  so in finding a safe haven for the night, you are spoilt for choice.</p>
<p>There are marinas at Hamilton Island and at Abell Point (Airle Beach - see photo). At Abell Point there is a private anchorage available outside the breakwater under seperate management to the marina.</p>
<p>Note that even though the channel to Laguna Quays Marina has silted, it is still accessible with sufficient rise of tide.</p>
<p>In 2012 cruisers reported that AUD$10million public liability insurance was  required at Abell Point Marina, however not at Hamilton Island Marina. The marinas further  north however do require it. See <a href="Members/sue/R2012-07-31-2"><strong>noonsite  report</strong></a> for further details.</p>
