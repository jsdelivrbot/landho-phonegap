<div class="hello"><div><p>Coffs Harbour lies about 200nm south of Brisbane. Once <span>a fishing village, it still </span><span>retains its original charm</span><span> even though it is now a city. This area has a great climate and is a favourite holiday destination </span><span>with a backdrop of mountains and fronted by sandy beaches.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a large number of water-based activities to choose from here. </span><span>It is also surrounded by several National parks which include an important marine reserve. The growing of bananas is a big industry here.</span></p>
<p><strong>June 2016:</strong> Coffs Harbour Marina suffered extensive storm damage. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-06/coffs-harbour-marina-storm-damage/7483076">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-06/coffs-harbour-marina-storm-damage/7483076</a></strong>.

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/australia-pics/australia_coffs-harbour/@@images/image/preview"/><b>Coffs Harbour Marina currently unable to cater for visiting yachts due to storm damage (see note above). </b></p>
<p>Yachts can anchor in the inner or outer anchorage, or take a berth in the marina (depending on availability). <i>Photo courtesty of SY Estrellita.</i></p>
<p><span>The inner anchorage (red star) is more protected in general from the swell and is between the old pier and the marina. </span></p>
<p><span>The outer anchorage (yellow star) is anywhere outside of the old pier including close up against the breakwater to the SE. It general it can be pretty rolly in the outer anchorage.</span></p>
<p>This is a very easy place to walk and bus to get various supplies. There are many small restaurants in the marina area itself and a 5 minute walk outside the marina. If you want quick groceries, there is a small IGA close by and a very large Cole’s supermarket further away towards town.</p>
<p><span>There are beautiful beaches on either side of the marina with lots of activity. The small hill overlooking the marina is a good walk.</span></p>
