<div class="hello"><div><p>Due to the tidal range here, anchoring overnight near the town of Derby is not possible unless the boat can take the ground.</p>
<p>The maze of islands to the east of the entrance to King Sound is more likely to provide a sheltered anchorage as long as care is taken with the tidal height calculations.</p>
<p>There is a jetty but no other yachting facilities.</p>
