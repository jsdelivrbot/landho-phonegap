<div class="hello"><div><p>A young, fast growing city, largely rebuilt in the last 50 years. It sits on the eastern side of the large, 20 mile long inlet, known as Darwin Harbour, and which is fed by several rivers. It is Australia's most northerly city and is a <span>fascinating</span> mix of cultures.</p>
<p><span>The combined presence of an an active racing and cruising community and a large fishing fleet has resulted in an excellent range of repair facilities unequalled for thousands of miles. </span></p>
<p>Position 12°27'S, 130° 49' 10"E.</p></div></div>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>If arriving from abroad, see <a href="Countries/Australia/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Australia/Clearance</strong></a> for details.</p>
<p>On approach, contact either a coastal radio station on 2182 kHz or the Darwin Port Authority on VHF channel 16. There are relay stations around all of Australia's coasts, making it possible to use VHF radio over much longer distances than normal. The operator should be given the name of the yacht, number of crew and ETA Darwin, and be asked to advise Quarantine and, if necessary, Customs.</p>
<p>Prior to inspection, boats anchor in the quarantine area situated northwest of the commercial harbour. There are various docks where one may be directed for clearance, but because of the large tidal range and strong currents, small boats find it easiest to come alongside the Fishermen's Wharf and therefore this should be requested by radio.</p>
<p>Clearance is also possible at Cullen Bay Marina, but this must be agreed with Darwin port control before proceeding there.</p>
<p>All yachts, Australian and others, may have to be inspected to prevent the spread of several marine pests (various species of mussel). If a boat has not recently been hauled out/antifouled in Australia (within 14 days and has the paperwork to prove it) it will have to have the hull inspected.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Fisheries/index.cfm?header=Vessel%20Inspections"><strong>www.nt.gov.au/d/Fisheries/index.cfm?header=Vessel%20Inspections</strong></a></p>
<p>Because of the strict quarantine regulations, in the past cruising boats have had all their fresh produce, especially meat, confiscated and destroyed. The attitude seems more relaxed in Darwin where boats intending to spend a short time in Australia have succeeded in having their freezers sealed or have all tinned meat products sealed in a locker.</p>

      The NT government will cover the costs associated with hull inspections and the cost of treating the internal seawater systems of the vessel. It is very important that en-route to Darwin you don't stop off along the coastline to clean your hull: there are no penalties for a fouled hull.<br>
If you have any queries regarding the procedures in place, please contact NT Fisheries Group.This will delay entry by approx. 10 hours and may be completed at Cullen Bay pontoon or at anchorage in Fannie Bay.

<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/><i> Fannie Bay </i>(approximately 12º25S 130º 50'E), off the Darwin Sailing Club (which offers temporary membership). Good holding in mud. Possible to leave the dinghy directly in front of the sailing club buildings.</p>
<p>A second anchorage is located east of Darwin Wharf (approximately 12º28'S 130º51'E), but this is exposed to the south east winds that prevail in July and August, and there are no facilities nearby.</p>

      This primarily a facility for the fishing fleet. The concrete solid piers can be a little too basic for many yachts, and your boat will need good protection with fenders. Water, electricity, toilets,  showers. <br>
Other than Cullen Bay Marina, this is the only option for catamarans to berth alongside. Due to the very large tides, most marinas have tidal sluice gates to lock the water in the marina, and therefore are restricted in width on entering.
