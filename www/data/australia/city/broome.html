<div class="hello"><div><p>There is no marina here, just two anchorages. The Department of Transport must be advised before dropping your anchor. They can also advise whether a mooring is available. See the contact below.</p>
<p>One anchorage is at Gantheaume Point <strong>(</strong><span>17° 57.86' S, 122° 11.55' E). The are some mooring buoys here but they need to be  booked in advance.  This is the only anchorage which is safe from the south easterlies common in the dry season.</span></p>
<p><span>The other anchorage is in <span>Roebuck Bay (<span>17<span>°</span> 59'S, 122<span>°</span> 14'E</span>). This is close to town, and therefore convenient for shore trips, but this bay is subject to the East winds that whip up an uncomfortable fetch. Also with the tidal range of up to 10m dinghy trips ashore need to be well planned.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can take the ground, then Dampier Creek is an option with the added advantage of access to Streetier Jetty for getting ashore.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Fuel can be obtained here, but with difficulty. It requires berthing at the commercial wharf and it is necessary to give 24hr notice. Since the wharf is high, it is best to do the re-fueling at high tide.</span></p>
<p><span>Water is also available at the commercial wharf.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Broome has all the shops you would expect in a thriving regional tourist town, including supermarkets. But provisioning here is difficult as having overcome the difficult access to the shore, there is no transport into the town except taxis.</span></span></p>
