<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a long jetty to the west of the commercial dock in Portland Harbour, known as the old marina, which is used by small local yachts for mooring.</p>
<p>To the north of the jetty is a mooring field for local boats. These moorings have now been declared unsafe and the mooring lines have been cut, leaving the ground foul. It is not advisable to try and anchor anywhere near here.</p>
<p>There may be room to anchor clear of the moorings, off the end of the new "marina".</p>
<p>This relatively new, 70 berth "marina", opened in 2013 and is more of a secure pontoon. It has n<span>o breakwater, no toilets, showers or laundry, just security gates.</span></p>
