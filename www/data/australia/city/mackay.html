<div class="hello"><div><p>The tropical city of Mackay, located midway between Brisbane and Cairns, is the "sugar capital" of Australia. It is a prosperous city and its proximity to the rainforest and the Whitsunday reefs make it a very attractive destination.</p>
<p>This is a good place to stop if travelling either north or south, as most boat facilities and services are available here onsite at Mackay's large boatyard. Cruisers report that prices for repairs can be cheaper here than in Cairns. It is also a useful base if cruising the nearby islands.</p>
<p>Approach Mackay with caution and patience, as plenty of bulk carriers are usually anchored offshore waiting to be loaded at Hay Point. Keep the VHF on scan because the reef pilots now mostly move by helicopter. Be aware that if you have AIS on board, alarms will start sounding on approach, as the many anchored carriers shift about slightly on their moorings - the AIS will pick this up that they are under way.</p>
<p>Position 21°09' 02"S, 149°13′34"E (river entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Mackay Marina is now a well established and modern marina, providing good protection from the weather. On entering, yachts should pass through the first (commercial) area to the marina area, which forms the southern part.</p>
<p>The marina is part of a residential village with a hotel, restaurants, shops, chandlery and shipyard included. It is 15 minutes by car from Mackay town where more extensive provisioning is possible.</p>
<p><span>Anchoring outside the marina is definitely not advised due to busy shipping, 6m+ tides and exposure to weather.</span></p>
