<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to Botany Bay is located about 8nm south of the entrance to Sydney Harbour. On the northern side of the bay is the large container port of Port Botany and also Sydney airport.</p>
<p>It is famous for being the site of the first landing of Captain Cook while sailing his ship, <i>Endeavour</i>, when exploring the Australian coast. The actual landing place is marked by a monument on the Kurnell Peninsula headland, on the southern side of the bay.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Not much is known about the yachting facilities here, but there appear to be several anchorages and small marinas.</p>
<p>At the western end of the bay, where the Georges River enters, there is a small marina at Sans Suci. Kogarth Bay is a good anchorage and is also the home of the Botany Bay Yacht Club and the swinging moorings rented by McKay marine.</p>
<p>Further along the north shore, is Shipwrights Bay which also houses a marina.</p>
