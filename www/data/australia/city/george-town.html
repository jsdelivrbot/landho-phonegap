<div class="hello"><div><p>It is possible to rent the George Town Yacht Club jetty for short periods or there may be a free mooring available.</p>
<p>There is also a marina here at Beauty Point where there is also a public jetty.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor outside the GTYC moorings but it is quite deep and subject to river currents.</p>
<p>There are several sheltered anchorages in the various arms of the river above George Town.</p>
