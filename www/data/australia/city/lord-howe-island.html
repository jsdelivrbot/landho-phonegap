<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../australia-pics/australia_lord-howe-island"/>Call the Harbour Master/Policeman on VHF Channel 12 for directions for entering the lagoon.</p>
<p>All vessels are required to use one of the 16 mooring buoys provided. Anchoring here is not permitted, nor is entry by night. If draft or weather conditions do not allow entry to the lagoon, then advice via VHF radio will be given to pilot the boat to an alternative anchorage.</p>
<p>The moorings are .5 to .75 of a mile from the shore, a journey best undertaken in a substantial dinghy.</p>
<p>Port and landing fees are payable at Lord Howe Island Board (LHIB) office on Bowker Ave., a ten minute walk from the wharf.</p>
<p><i>Mooring Fees (2015):</i> $44 per night ($88 minimum charge) or $278 per week (Prices include GST).<br/> Administration Booking Fee $33.00 (non-efundable)<br/> Environmental Levy: $41.20 per person one off payment (GST exempt).</p>
<p>Fees can be paid at the Board’s Administration Office in Bowker Avenue between 8:30am and 4:30pm Monday to Friday at the Lord Howe Island Board Administration Office or at the Liquor Store between 1:00pm and 4:30pm on Saturday. Please note that payment cannot be made on Sunday.</p>
<p>No refuse or liquid waste of any type can be discharged into the lagoon. Without a holding tank, the heads cannot be used. Much of the waters surrounding Lord Howe are a NSW Marine Park with certain fishing restrictions. A brochure is available from the Island Board mapping the fishing/no fishing areas.</p>
<p>There is water, toilets, showers and a washing machine in the building on the jetty. Gold coin donation appreciated. If locked, the key is available for a deposit from the LHIB office.</p>
