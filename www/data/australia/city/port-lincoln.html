<div class="hello"><div><p>Both entrances to Boston Bay are well-buoyed and lit as are the many aquaculture sites.</p>
<p>As it is the home of a large fishing fleet most services are available here.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage in front of the Yacht Club between, the main wharf and the Town jetty. It is possible to moor to the town jetty for a short stay, which makes it convenient for provisioning.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Cove marina is situated south of the town in Porter Bay. The recreational boaters' part of the marina is to port immediately inside the entrance. Further in are the commercial and fishing fleet berths, as well as berths for visitors' boat over 18m.</p>
<p>There is good cruising around this area.</p>
