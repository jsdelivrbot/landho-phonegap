<div class="hello"><div><p>Exmouth's claim to fame is the fact that it is the closest mainland town to the continental shelf. This results in there being very rich fishing grounds within close reach. In addition, it has colourful coral reefs very close to the shore.</p>
<p>It is situated on the tip of land called the North West Cape, on the western side of the Exmouth Gulf.</p>
<p>Position 21° 57' S, 114° 8' E.</p></div></div>
