            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Algeria has over 700 miles of Mediterranean coastline, behind which lie mountains and fertile plains, with the vast Sahara desert to the south. Along its entire length, the Algerian coast has no indentations and all the ports are man-made as there are no natural harbours.</li>
<li>With very few exceptions, the ports are crowded and polluted, which is the main reason why cruising yachts very seldom go out of their way to stop in Algeria. The one notable exception is Sidi Fredj, west of the capital Algiers, where a tourist development surrounds the harbour, part of which has been converted into a marina. </li>
<li>Algeria has suffered many years of bloody conflict between government forces and fundamentalists. Visits by cruising yachts cannot be recommended, if one needs to stop, especially in emergencies, ports such as the marina at Sidi Fredj should be preferred rather than one of the commercial ports. Anyone planning to visit Algeria should contact their own embassy or consulate in Algiers to get an update on the current security situation.</li>
<li>If planning a passage that passes close to Algeria, best advice is to <span>stand well outside 12nm off the Algerian coast unless visas, and boat permissions, have already been negotiated. </span></li>
<li>SY Adina visited Algeria in August 2013 and provided noonsite with an excellent report of their visit - see <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Algeria/welcome-to-algeria-we-were-met-with-goodwill-and-generosity">here</a></b>. The Algeria noonsite information will be updated as soon as possible with Adina's feedback, however for now their report is the most up to date information we have.</li>

<div><p>Although things are safer than they were, it is still advisable to check a national advisory website such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/algeria"><strong>The UK FCO website</strong></a> before calling at any Algerian port. It is advised that the coast for 150 miles east of Algiers be avoided.</p>
