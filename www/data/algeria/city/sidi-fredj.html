<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is tricky in on shore winds due to being shallow. The marina is subject to silting but was dredged in 2013 to minimum depth of about 2.5m.</p>
<p>Facilities are basic and the marina is in poor state of repair with water and electricity points destroyed. There are some repair facilities in Sidi Fredj, which has a number of locally owned yachts. There is a 16-ton travelift as well as fuel and water (via a local yacht owner) in the marina.</p>
<p>Theft from boats left unattended has been reported so it is not advisable to leave a boat unattended for any length of time unless arrangements have been made to have it watched.</p>
