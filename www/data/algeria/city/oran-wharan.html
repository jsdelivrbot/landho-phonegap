<p>The coastguard will board the boat at the entrance.</p>
<p>Coastguard, Police, Harbour Master and Immigration will visit the boat to complete formalities. <span>If entering or leaving Algeria insist on getting a visit from Customs. It can take some time to organise this.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts are now directed to berth near the ferry terminal (not in the marina).</p>
<p>The Harbour Master can arrange water and also fuel, but this is expensive as it has to be delivered by tanker.</p>
<p>It is necessary to take a taxi to the town (<span>around 200dh) as officials do not like you walking by yourself.</span></p>
