<div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Legally an advance visa is required of most Nationals before entering <strong><i>Algeria waters</i></strong>. This implies that any boat within 12nm of the coast may be boarded, and asked for its intentions.</p>
<p>Call the Coast Guard on VHF channel 16 on entering Algerian waters. Mention that you have a tourist visa and be sure to fly the Algerian courtesy flag.</p>
<p>Most ports monitor VHF Channels 12 or 14, but apart from Arabic, only French is usually understood. Yachts must <strong>clear in and out </strong>of each harbour. Sidi Fredj, which has a marina, is the best port of entry as the officials there are used to yachts. It is necessary to clear with Customs, police and the military as well.</p>
<p>If you have AIS, ensure it is on. You are likely to be checked at least daily while in Algerian waters. Always call the Harbour Master before entering any port.</p>
<p>Customs may search the yacht and will require an inventory. Foreign currency and main dutiable items should be declared. If not the owner of the boat, the captain must have a written authorisation from the owner.</p>
<p>Do not expect any helpful officials who take your lines know what to do with them!</p>
<p>Always advise the police of any plans to leave to port and explore the town.</p>
<p>Fishing ports are more relaxed regarding paperwork than in official ports. However, it is still likely to take several hours to deal with it all, so friendliness and patience are required. Be prepared with many copies of all documents and have a boat stamp too.</p>

<div><p>Passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your visit.</p>
<p>All nationals require visas except nationals of Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Seychelles, Syrian, Tunisia and the Yemen.</p>
<p>Tourist visas are valid approximately one month. Visas should be obtained in advance from Algerian diplomatic missions and consulates abroad, preferably in your country of residence. Allow plenty of time for this to be obtained.</p>
<p>Visas cannot be issued on arrival.</p>
<p>There are Algerian consulates in Morocco and Tunisia.</p>
<p>Citizens of Israel, Malawi and Taiwan will be refused entry, and those with  stamps from these countries in their passports will have great difficulty obtaining a visa.</p>
<p>Always mention that you have a tourist visa when dealing with any officials.</p>

<p>Narcotics and pork products are prohibited.</p>
<p>It saves much time if you have ready lists of valuables on board (laptops, cameras, etc).</p>
<p><span>On your first entry, ensure the Customs that board your boat give you a form that states the currency you have on board. You will need this to change money in banks.</span></p>
