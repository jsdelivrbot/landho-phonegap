<div class="hello"><div><p>Located about 120nm south of the border with Tanzania in the northern section of the country.</p>
<p>This popular tourist port occupies the peninsula on the southern shore of the entrance to Baie de Pemba. Much of its popularity is due to the fact that there is a coral reef close to the shore and the town contains an interesting local market selling silverware as well as local crafts. Whale watching here in September is a spectacular show.</p>
