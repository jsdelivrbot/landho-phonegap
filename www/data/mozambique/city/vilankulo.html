<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The anchorage is difficult to get into as a bar blocks the way at low water (min.1.5m). Enter only at high tide. </span><span> </span><span>The deeper water, further away from the beach, is sand with good holding, but generally this is an open anchorage. </span></p>
<p><span>It is quite far from town and the “port” to which you can take the dinghy at all tides. Local boat-boys will approach you.</span></p>
