<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a deep water port connected to Malawi by a rail line for the export of coal.</p>
<p>Whilst Nacala Bay is an area of outstanding beauty, the town itself is nothing special and the port area has a bad reputation for theft.</p>
<p>Whales migrate through here July to September. There are a number of diving lodges around the bay as the diving here is said to be spectacular.</p>
<p><span>Position </span><span>14°26'40"S,  040°0'E (entrance to the bay)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Nacala port area has a repuation for theft, so an alternative is to anchor off one of the many dive lodges around the bay.</span></p>
<p>Libélula Dive Lodge is located in a protected bay to starboard of the main port at about 14°29S 40°44.7E. The couple who run this lodge took it over in 2009 and do not object to yachts passing by and anchoring here, however space is limited. There is a marine reserve directly off the beach (350m along the coast &amp; 150M sea-ward), however the beach drops off to around 20-30m+, and below 20m (100-200m off the beach) it is 80% sand, so anchoring is no real problem. Take care though to avoid any coral.</p>
<p>On a high tide it is possible to dinghy into the beach, but the low tide exposes a band of terraced rocks. A member of staff is on the beach 24/7, so this bay is generally pretty secure.</p>
<p>Ashore you will find a good small market for vegetables and fresh bread, supermarkets and ATMs.</p>
<p>Until very recently, Nacala was extremely remote and very difficult to get to by road, however now road conditions are good to Nampula (airport).</p>
