            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>The People's Republic of Mozambique has some 1400 miles of coastline on the Indian Ocean, between South Africa and Tanzania. The island area of Basaruto and the area around Maputo provide some of the best cruising. </li>
<li><span>Unfortunately however, as with the rest of Africa, the corruption and mis-management in Mozambique since independence and freedom from colonial rule has escalated exponentially and unless you experience an emergency, it is recommended to choose carefully where you stop here. Although some places have had favourable reports from cruising boats they are the exception (Ilha de Mozambique being one). Most ports have been privatised giving the locals a license to do as they please more efficiently.</span></li>
<li>Stopovers without clearing in are generally tolerated by the authorities who accept this as long as you are just sheltering from the weather. However, it's better to choose an anchorage removed from the authorities such as Bazaruto, Inhambane /Ponta Barra &amp; Inhaca Island.</li>
<li>Repair facilities are available in Beira and Maputo, where there are dockyards dealing with repairs on fishing vessels.</li>

<div>It is advisable to read current travel advise from a state source such as the U.K's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique"><b>FCO website</b></a>.
<p>Caution is advised if travelling inland as the presence of landmines laid during the war is a continuing hazard in spite of de-mining efforts.</p>
<p>Street crime, sometimes involving knives and firearms, is common in Maputo and is increasing in other cities and tourist destinations.  Bag-snatching, pick-pocketing and car-jacking are also problems. Criminal kidnapping are increasingly common.</p>
<p>Remain vigilant on beaches or off shore islands as they are not policed.</p>
