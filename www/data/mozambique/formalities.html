            </h2>
<div><p><span>Ensure you have a courtesy flag that is larger than your national flag, as at times this has resulted in $100 fine.</span></p>
<p>Authorities are generally pleasant and cooperative, although formalities can be time-consuming. Speaking Portuguese is certainly an advantage as few officials speak any English.</p>
<p><span>Officials in Mozambique are notorious for demanding they hold on to your passport (a ploy to extract money from you in order to get these documents back). If the return of passports becomes impossible, the South African Immigration officials are familiar with cruisers arriving from Mozambique without them. You may therefore decide to leave without them and have them reissued once in SA. Authorities here will issue you with a temporary travel document until such time as your local embassy can issue new documents.</span></p>
<p>If leaving for a foreign port, it may be advisable to leave from Maputo as officials in the smaller ones are unfamiliar with the necessary procedures for yachts.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months.</p>
<p>Most visitors require a visa in advance of arrival.</p>
<p>On arrival Immigration officials will stamp your passport and then issue embarkation cards or shore passes to yachts in transit, instead of issuing visas. This is now standard practice up and down the coast. These shore passes usually have a limit of 30 days, but can be extended. It is important to get an extension before the expiry date.</p>
<p>Special permission may be necessary to travel inland outside the Maputo province if the security situation is bad.</p>

<div><p>It is prohibited to take photographs of public buildings, military installations or soldiers. The legacy of an authoritarian regime has left officials, and especially the military, extremely suspicious of any foreigners, so one should exercise due caution when using a camera and avoid photographing any buildings or installations that could be regarded as sensitive.</p>
<p>There are also restrictions on diving, which is prohibited in some areas.</p>
