                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>Formalities can be very time-consuming everywhere, although officials are generally polite and helpful. Start early as government offices close for lunch from 11:30 to 14:00. Normally yachts are not boarded and the captain has to go into town to find the various offices. The order of visits is important, as certain forms have to be taken from one office to another.</p>
<p>First go to the Immigration office (Police Federal) with all the crew and passports. They will issue the "<span>Passe de Entrada de embarcação"  (Entry pass for a ship). Do not lose it as it will have to be returned when you leave that port.</span></p>
<p>Next, go to Customs (Receita Federal). They will issue a <span>TECAT (Termo de concessao de admission temporaria).  This document gives you the right to enter your yacht without paying tax because you are transiting and not staying or running a business. Although the <span>Receita Federal only needs to be visited on first entry and on exit from Brazil, it is likely that you will need to produce this document many times.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Then, the Health Authorities (Vigilancia Sanitaria)- with the compilation of everything plus vaccination docs if any.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Finally, visit the </span><span>Port Captain (Capitania dos Portos) with all the forms and documentation previously produced. Here yet another form has to be filled in. This is a cruising permit (passe de saida) and will be issued at the port of entry by the Port Captain. This form is another 'do not loose' one as it will then be stamped at every port you enter.  If staying longer than 90 days, ensure that this permit is renewed in time. It is also particularly important to conform to the dress code at this office.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Remember, all the crew has to be present at these offices.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>It is also a good idea to have a copy of the resolution which exempts non-commercial private yachts from needing a Health Certificate, as the Coast Guard and/or Health offices often still wish to see such a certificate. See <a href="Members/val/R2010-05-31-4"><b>Brazilian Health Controls</b></a> for the full text(in Portuguese and English).</p>
<p>Some yachts have reported having to use a special officially approved agent (despachante), whom one is introduced to on arrival. The agent takes passports and ship's papers and does the entry formalities for a fee. This usually only applies to the first entry into the country and also depends on local officials. It is more likely to occur at a commercial port like Natal.</p>
<p>There are some ports where it is best for yachts to make their initial check in; Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, Paranagua and Rio Grande. These harbours are used to yachts checking in, while other harbours are more used to ships which use an agent. This can cost between 500 &amp; 1000R. Cruisers report that <span>Angra dos Reis (South of Rio) or Capodelo </span><span>(North of Recife) have the most friendly officials.</span></p>
<p>After having completed the initial clearance at a port of entry, it is necessary to obtain clearance to the next port, although is allowable to cruise and stop on the way. Request clearance to the next port <code>with stops</code> (con escala). At every major port en route, port authority and Federal Police offices must be visited. This is particularly important on entering a new state. This clearance is strictly enforced, and failure to do so can lead to on the spot fines of up to US$5000.</p>
<p>A new 2009 law requests that all yachts in transit not flying a Mercosul flag (i.e. one from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay or Uruguay) be registered with Customs and file a "Simplified Temporary Importation." This entails a "despachante" and at least 24 hours of waiting for documentation.</p>
<p>On leaving the country, all these officials (excluding Health), must be visited in the reverse order.</p>
<p>It is helpful to use the correct Portuguese names for officials and paperwork as it avoids confusion.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Smart dress must be worn to visit official offices (no shorts, t-shirts or casual shirts are allowed). See <a href="Countries/Brazil/?rc=Formalities#Restrictions"><strong>Restrictions</strong></a></p>

<p><i>US cruising boat SY Two Fish cleared into Brazil in October 2014. Their blog has excellent detail and a step by step guide. <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.twofishcat.com/2014/10/02/brazilian-customs-border-patrol-and-police/">http://www.twofishcat.com/2014/10/02/brazilian-customs-border-patrol-and-police/</a></strong></i></p></div>

            </h2>
<div><p>Passports must be valid for six months from arrival date except Argentinians and Uruguayans, who only require a national identity card.</p>
<p>A 90 day visa is issued initially, which may be renewable on request for another 90 days (although this is not guaranteed) from the Federal Police on payment of a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> <i>- Dec 2013: Noosite has received reports that some <span>Federal Police</span> officers are enforcing a 90 day stay only (in any 6 month period) where this is applied to Brazilians visiting the cruiser's home country. In these circumstances, the visitors are given only a day or two to leave Brazil.</i></p>
<p><span>To extend your visa, you go to the <span>Policia Federal</span> website section for Estrangeiros (currently only in Portuguese).  Print out a payslip, one per person, take them to the Banco de Brasil and make payment. Take the receipt with the usual passport/papers to <span>Federal Police</span>, along with “proof of funds” (bank or credit card statement). </span></p>
<p>A maximum of 90 days only (or 180 if an extension has been granted) per year may be spent in Brazil. It is important that the renewal is done <strong>before</strong> the visa expires, but be aware that the extension will be dated from the date of application for the extension and any time remaining on the original visa will be lost.</p>
<p>See also the Noonsite report <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2010-01-06-2">Procedure to Request an Extension of Visa in Brazil</a> </strong>for some very useful detailed instructions on how to do this at Salvador International Airport.</p>
<p>Visas are not required by nationals of some countries for stays of up to 90 days in a 180 day period.</p>
<p>Other nationalities, including Australian, US and Canadian citizens, need to obtain a visa before arrival.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://sistemas.mre.gov.br/kitweb/datafiles/CgLondres/en-us/file/qgrv-simples-ing-25_09_2015.pdf"><strong>Consulate General website- updated Sept 2015</strong></a> for the latest list.</p>
<p>Visas are normally only be valid for 90 days from the date of issue. US citizens may be able to obtain a five year multiple-entry visa in advance which is a good alternative if you plan to leave the yacht in Brazil and then return, but it appears it is not easy to obtain.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes for Yacht Crews</strong></p>
<p>Visa regulations are designed for visitors arriving by air, and in some ports the authorities insist on everyone having a visa, even nationalities that are normally exempt.</p>
<p>According to the Brazilian Consul in Las Palmas, visas are no longer required by UK and US citizens arriving on their yachts, but the actual situation is not clear and Consulate in San Francisco contradicts this. <br/> <i>In June 2012 a cruiser reported that U.K. citizens arriving at Salvador in a U.K. registered yacht had no problem getting a visa on arrival.</i></p>
<p>If, therefore, there is any doubt, it is advisable for everyone arriving by yacht to obtain a visa in advance, but you must enter Brazil within 90 days of the visa being issued.</p>
<p>Another important point to note, is that if a delivery crew is used, the owner must be at the Port of Entry when the yacht arrives. Failure to do this might incure a heavy fine and other complications.</p>
<p><i>Cruisers report being given 72 hours to leave the country when arriving without a visa and having to pay an agent $600 for clearance papers.</i></p>
<p>It is mandatory to carry ID at ALL times in Brazil. If you are not carrying ID you may be arrested.</p>

<p>Yachts are permitted to stay a maximum 24 months. A letter of permission is required from the Port Captain and this is usually faxed to The Recita (Customs) who are responsible for enforcing the rule.</p>
<p>The amount of time permitted for crew remains the same as for other tourists (generally 90 days with 90 day extension).</p>

<div><p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Brazil has been regarded as one of the most intensely affected areas. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</p>
<p><strong><b>Dengue Fever</b>: The number of dengue fever cases in Brazil has increased considerably since 2015, especially in the south-east and central-west. Cases of Chikunyunga virus have been confirmed in Brazil and the number of reported cases in the region is increasing.</strong></p>
<p>Current Yellow fever vaccination certificates are required by those arriving from the following countries :- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and French Guiana, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Sudan.</p>
<p>Those who arrive either without a certificate or who have not been vaccinated will have to be vaccinated in Brazil, which is not always done under the most hygienic conditions.</p>
<p>In rural areas especially, there is the risk of malaria, <strong>dengue fever</strong>, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis and yellow fever, so vaccination or prophylactic treatment is recommended.</p>
<p>Lunch and snacks are safest if freshly cooked and served hot. Always wash fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are chlorinated but Bilharzia is present along riverbanks so keep your footwear on.</p>
<p>In fresh water (i.e. in the Amazon) be aware of the danger of shoals of piranha fish. They are voracious!</p>
<p>Before filling up with water in Brazil, always make sure that you are using the correct water. Some water is only meant for wash-down and is not potable.</p>

<div>It is not advisable to carry your passport other than for official business and a photocopy does not last and does not look 'official'.</div>
<div></div>
<div>One suggestion is to have a colour scan or copy made of the photo page of your passport and the front cover. Have this reduced to slightly larger than a standard business card. Place the two images back to back and have them laminated. You now have a very official looking, waterproof ID card that will last years. It is common to be asked for ID/Passport when making a credit card purchase.</div></div>
