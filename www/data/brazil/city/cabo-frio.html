<p>If travelling south, this is gennerally the last possible stop before reaching Rio, about 120 miles to the west.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The unmarked entrance to the river (Rio Itajuru), on which is situated the marina, becomes visible only when very close. The entrance has 4 metres, but it shallows very quickly. Beware of the current; it runs at up to 5kn!</p>
<p>Turn immediately to port once through the entrance and the marina is on the western shore and is run by the Royal Rio Yacht Club. Mooring is normally stern-to the concrete dock, using your own anchor at the bow. The strong current makes it advisable to carry out this manover at slack water.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage 4 miles SE of Cabo Frio town in the bay (Ensenda aos Anjos) off Arraial do Cabo. Here the holding is good in sand and mud but stay clear of the commercial wharf which is used by the oil rig supply vessels.</p>
<p>Another good anchorage is the Ilha de Cabo Frio, 6 miles SE of Cabo Frio. Approach is from the west through a 300 metre wide <code>hole in the wall</code>. Turn to starboard after passing through the gap to this secluded anchorage.</p>

      The club runs the marina which offers the following services:- fresh water, electricity (110v &amp; 220v), fuel, diesel, showers, WC, BBQ, TV, small mast crane and a garden. Security is good and the site well guarded.<br>
Note; The YC is situated in a poor part of the town and it is not advisable to walk to downtown after dark. During the day, though, it is a pleasant walk along the beach.<br>
The YC staff, generally, only speak Portuguese.
