<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying approximately 300NM NE of Montevideo, it is not to be confused with Rio Grande do Sul or Rio Grande do Norte. Being just about 100NM from the border with Uraguay, it is a strategic destination.</p>
<p>A busy harbour with a difficult entrance. A 4 or 5 knot tide can run out of the entrance after persistant northerlies and it can be very rough.</p>
<p>Advisable to contact Rio Grande Pilot Station VHF 16/09 when outside of the outer jetties, for current conditions. </p>
<p>Position 32°02.5'S, 52°10.7'W.</p>

<p>If this is your first stop in Brazil you will need to hire a taxi to go to the Policia Federal, Capitania Dos Portos, and Receita Federal (Customs). At the Receita Federal you will be asked for an insurance policy to establish the value of your vessel. Both Policia Federal and Capitania Dos Portos exit papers will be required to depart. Go to the Policia Federal first, then to the Capitania, and then to the Receita Federal. It will take all afternoon.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>You will first enter the main port than proceed another ten miles to the city center. Follow the buoyed channel. </p>
<p>Once past the large ship wharf you will turn to port at the naval station. Do not wander too far to the right once you have made the turn to port at the naval station, as it is shallow here. From here you will pass numerous fishing vessels and their respective wharves until you see a dock with a green house on stilts next to it. </p>
<p>This is one of the docks of the Museo Oceangraphico. There is another dock slightly beyond where you can tie or raft to other sailing vessels. Lauro, the director of the museum, is well-known for the help he gives to visiting cruisers.</p>
<p>The yacht club is just beyond the museum dock, the last group of buildings on the portside shore. Moor to the jetty. </p>
