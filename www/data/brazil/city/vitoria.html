<p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p>Cruisers report that the procedures here are straightforward. Read <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/brazil-vitoria-clearing-in-and-out-and-visa-renewal-process">this report 2015</a></strong> by SY Caramore with detailed clearance guidelines and advice on visa renewal.</p>
<p>If clearing into Brazil here you must visit the <span>Policia Federal (Marine division) NEPON, the Maritime Tax department and the Capitania - in that order.</span></p>
<p>If arriving from another state, you must visit t<span>he Capitania and the Policia Federal (Marine division) NEPON. If staying less than 72 hours you can clear in and out at the same time.</span></p>
<p>The yacht club Marina can assist with Immigration and Customs, which MAY come to you at the marina, depending on how busy they are.  If not, a taxi will be needed.</p>

      A 20 minute walk from the yacht club. Turn left along the promenade and keep walking straight until you arrive at the Capitania compound (a white wall with Capitania written on it). On the way you will cross the road by the bridge to Ihla do Frade, pass Vitória Shopping on your left, walk under the bridge flyover and pass the coffee exchange on your right. If you are not sure, ask for "Praca do Pape", which is nearby.

      This shopping centre is on the mainland, on the other side of the 3rd bridge (no pedestrian or cycle access). There are buses but it is easier to get a taxi (BR$30 from the yacht club). Ask for a 'Prorrogacao de Prazo'.

<div class="hello"><div><p>Good charts are essential to be able to safely negotiate the Baia Espirito Santo (which has a bar running through it) and the shallow approach up to the moorings. A night approach is also possible with close attention to the lights and marks as the entrance is well marked.</p>
<p>Yachts with up to 2m draught should be able to enter the yacht basin where you will be directed to a berth. Visitors are often given berth on on the western arm of the yacht basin where they moor stern-to. Sufficient cable should be let out to counteract the strong onshore breeze which is typical of afternoon conditions. Yachts with deeper draught may have to anchor off and come in by tender.</p>
<p>There is a fairly new and well-maintained marina here, run by the yacht club, where boats pick up a stern mooring line, and tie the bow to the dock. Although it is very often full and a berth may not be available.</p>
<p>The most suitable anchorage is just off the yacht club, but beware of both the current and the depth on the SW side of the breakwater. An alternative anchorage is in Vitoria harbour itself, but this is not much used by yachts.</p>
<p>For the location of free anchoring here - see comment at bottom of page.</p>
