<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the most important city on the north coast and is also a busy fishing harbour.</p>
<p>For the unsuspecting, the bay is littered with wrecks (those not buoyed show above the water), and the water shallows quickly, so care should be taken on entry. Lights on the buoys can be undetected from over 50m away.</p>
<p>Position 03°42'S, 38°30'W.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><b>February 2015: </b>Another boat was board withing minutes of arriving by knife-wielding attackers. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/General/Piracy/piracy-reports-2015/brazil-fortaleza-yet-another-violent-attack-february-2015"><b>this cruisers'report</b></a></p>
<p>The previous night yet another yacht was boarded and robbed.<br/><strong>April 2014:</strong> a cruising boat was boarded, the crew attacked, beaten and robbed within moments of anchoring here. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Brazil/brazil-maranhao-sao-luis-dutch-cruising-sailor-shot-and-killed-february-2015"><b>this report</b></a></p>
<p>Visiting cruisers warn that parts of the city (including areas round the Park Hotel) are not safe, recommending to travel in groups and use a taxi instead of public transport. However, much of Fortaleza is fairly upscale with nice shopping and dining.</p>
<p>Credit card fraud is a problem here, so take extra care if using one.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is possible to anchor at the commercial harbour on arrival to check in. This anchorage however is not safe and there's no where to leave your dinghy when going ashore. The alternative is to berth at the marina and make the necessary office visits by taxi (cost approx. R$ 100).</p>
<p>Offices are open every day, 24 hours, and cruisers report not being charged overtime on a Saturday.</p>
<p>Authorities should be visited in the following order: Polica Federal, Customs (beside each other) then Port Captain - who has now moved next door to the yacht club. On departure the same order is followed.</p>
<p>Cruisers continue to report that officials here are very slow, and it may take a whole day to check in. English not spoken.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Most visitors moor at the Marina Park Hotel, to the west. A night entry should be avoided as many boats string lines right across the marina.</p>
<p>Note there is a wreck off the marina entrance whose submerged stern is located between waypoint EAPP and MPARK 1 as given on the marina website. Some of the latest reports from cruisers for Fortaleza give tips on how to best negotiate the entry to the marina.</p>
<p>Facilities at Marina Park were refurbished in 2012; pontoons added, painted and repaired. However, in the new section there are piles which can damage the boat when moored stern-to. The old section is safer, but even there care is necessary to keep the stern sufficiently far off the dock to avoid damage in a surge. Pontoons are reported to be unstable and dirty. However the hotel facilities are good here and free to use for marina users.</p>
<p>The yacht club is a "members only" club, however does welcome visitors in their bar/restaurant.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage off the Yacht Club is reported as unsafe following frequent robberies from yachts anchored there. Cruisers visiting December 2011 report that safety at anchor here is still an issue and currently a huge concrete wall is being built around the low cost housing in a bid to control crime.</p>
