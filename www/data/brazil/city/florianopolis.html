<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Florianopolis is the capital of the State of Santa Caterina and sits in the middle of the Ilha da Santa Caterina, linked to the mainland by 2 modern bridges. It is a popular tourist destination.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Both the north and south bays between the island and mainland are shallow, but can be safely navigated with attention to charts and tidal flows.</p>
<p>Position 27°6.47'S, 48°33.085'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="../FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span>It is now fairly easy to check in and out of Brazil here, although the 3 offices you have to visit (Policia Federal, Customs and Capatania) are rather spread out so you will need to use buses or taxis.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Customs is located close to the centre of town at the corner of Av Paulo Fontes and Rua Hoepcke. The man in charge, Ricardo Krzyzanowski, speaks good English and is very helpful. </span></p>
<p>The closest alternative clearance ports are <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/itajai">Itajai </a></strong>or Imbituba.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <i>The lower of the two bridges linking the island to the mainland town of Sao Jose has a clearance of only 17m.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you can get under the bridge there is an anchorage with free moorings off the seafront on the island side soon after passing north under the old suspension bridge.  Apparently the moorings were laid by the ICSC in 2014 for a racing event.  This is a better place to be in southerlies than off the yacht club.</p>
<p>The yacht club ( ICSC-Veleiros da Ilha) is approximately 1 mile south of the bridges, on the island side. Anchor in front of the club, or pick up one of their moorings, and land at their dock.</p>
<p>The ICSC also has a base near the northern end of the island at <span>Praia de Jurere</span><span>. </span><span>There is no option to moor at the end of jetty here, other than perhaps short term.  There's a large field of mooring buoys. On arrival you will likely be approached by a club boat asking if you want a mooring.</span></p>
<p><span>Yachts can also anchor closer to the main beach at Jurere and dinghy ashore.  This is a good spot for strong southerlies, good holding in thick mud.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">There is also a small marina at Santo Antonio de Lisboa, where many locals keep their sailing boats on moorings. The owner (Mr Cid) doesn't speak English but is friendly and helpful.  Anchor here in about 3 metres in soft mud.  It gets uncomfortable and untenable in strong southerlies, when you should go to <i>Jurere.</i></p>
<p>Also off the north of the channel is the bay of Enseada de Ganchos which has several anchorages and a small jetty belonging to the Iate Clube de Caioba who also have several mooring buoys there. <span>The bays provide good shelter from the south and east but are open to the north.  They are quite busy with fishing boat activity and shellfish farming buoys line the sides of the bays.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shore services</strong><br/>Floripa is a modern city with shops, restaurants and services to suit all tastes.  Transport options are also good: local and long distance bus services are efficient and reasonably priced.  Taxis and hire cars are also affordable.  Santa Caterina has a good road infrastructure and it's well worth exploring inland.</p>
