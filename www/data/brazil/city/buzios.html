<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Moorings</b><br>
There are moorings available from ICAB which are registered with the Maritime Authorities and are checked twice yearly by professional divers. However in 2011 a cruising yacht anchored downwind of the YC moorings did suffer a collision with a large boat that was using one of these moorings that dragged. Therefore it is advisable to anchor elsewhere.</br></p>
<p><b>Anchorages</b><br>
There are various anchorages along the shores of the town. The best anchorage is oposite the last house in the village, in the SW corner of the bay. In northerly winds, there is adequate protection to the north of the yacht club, on the southern side of the peninsular, but you are more exposed to the constant SE swell. There is more room to anchor in the other near-by bays, but they are less protected from the east.</br></p>
<p>Beware of the many, insufficiently marked, local fishing devices.</p>
