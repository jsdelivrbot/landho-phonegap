<div class="hello"><div><p>A large island about 10 nm SW of Salvador de Bahia.</p>
<p>Many cruisers preferred Itaparica to the other Salvador marinas, which tend to be more expensive as well as security being an issue in downtown Salvador. Itaparica is reported to be cheap with either a good anchorage or a comfortable pontoon mooring at the (small) marina, with great bars and a laid-back atmosphere. However security is now becoming an issue here too with boats being boarded and burgled (see reports adjacent) whilst at anchor.</p>
<p>Whilst it also used to be thought of as one of the safer places to go along this coast, crime against yachts continues here. However, if you are sensible and vigilant with securing your belongings and anchoring in company, there is no reason why this beautiful area should not be visited.</p></div></div>

<p>The marina is clearly the safest place to moor here <i>(see photo from Mar Sem Fim news article - http://marsemfim.com.br/)</i>. <span>The small government-run modern marina has floating pontoons and a dinghy dock (which yachts at anchor may use for a fee). There is also a "Policia Militar" post located permanently at the marina. Wifi can be accessed from the anchorage.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></p>
<p>Anchoring is possible just off the marina, although thefts were reported here in March 2015.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage on the NW end of the island which is very sheltered with good holding. The current runs at up to 2kn, so this must be considered when selecting space for anchoring. Only in fierce northerlies does the swell have any effect here and anchoring here would not be ideal in strong <span>S - SW winds.</span></p>
<p>Watch out for the reefs on Itaparica's northern side and the busy ferry traffic which travels at some speed. On approaching the anchorage, watch for the quickly shoaling sand bank to port.</p>
