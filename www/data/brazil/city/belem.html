<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the best port at which to enter Amazonia, but a detailed chart is essential for the Para River, which leads the 80 miles inland to Belem. This is a lively and interesting port.</p>

<p><strong>Security:</strong> There have been armed boardings and robberies here in the past, and sadly <b><a class="external-link" href="General/Piracy/piracy-reports-2014/brazil-belem-assault-and-robbery-march-2014">another reported in March 2014</a> </b>at <span>Mosqueiro Island (</span><span>Position: S01 10.4097, W048 28.4852)</span>.

<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of the intense boating activity in this area and take care regarding the tidal streams, which can reach up to 5kn.</p>
<p>Beyond the harbour, is the site of the former yacht club. There are no longer any shore facilities here.</p>
<p>Moorings are available at the Marina B&amp;B (001° 28.63’S 048° 28.47’W) and there is a dock where a dinghy can be safely left. Always ask the guards at the marina gate to get a taxi for you as the area around is not very safe. Take a business card with you to be able to show a taxi driver for the return trip.</p>
<p>Further up the river is an anchorage in front of the Hotel Beira Rio.</p>
<p>Most services, supplies and basic chandlery can be found in the town.</p>
