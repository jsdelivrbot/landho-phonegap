<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach is easy on a rising tide, and, with a good chart, many pleasant anchorages can be found on the way. At Marau, anchor approximately 1/2 mile off the village.</p>
<p>Camamu Sound itself has many peaceful, protected anchorages. A popular one with visiting yachts is off the villiage of Campinho. Anchor just inside the derelict concrete docks in front of some small restaurants. Be aware that the sand banks and bars do shift and that there are shallows up to 10 miles off the coast and that buoys and markers mentioned in pilot books may not exist!</p>
<p>Campinho has a few small shops and limited access to fresh water (on request).
Better supplies can be found at Camamu, but the approach to this town is too shallow for most yachts.</p>
