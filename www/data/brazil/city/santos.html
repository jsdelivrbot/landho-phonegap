<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachting facilities are not located on the mainland but across the Canal in Guaruja, on the island.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in main river but itis not recommended unless going ashore on the Santos side.</p>
<p>Approach from SW is straightforward with Santos Bay easily identified by the ships at anchor. The buoyed channel leads into the Estuario de Santos. The tidal stream can reach 1.5 knots in either direction. From the NW, there are off-lying dangers which cannot be seen.</p>
<p>From the south at night, picking up eading line No 1 on 021° can be difficult against city lights background.</p>
<p>There are moorings at the International Yacht Club, the Estaleiro Supmar, and Santos Yacht Club, although unfortunately Santos YC does not permit visiting yachts to use their facilities (restaurant and pool etc.).</p>

      All facilities are on site with excellent security. 30 ton travel lift copes with most needs and the 2 ton crane is used for most masts. Slip for smaller boats using a trailer and winch. Mooring is stern-to. Whilst principally for boats having work done at the yard, if there is space it will be given to transient yachts wanting berthing. Bar and restaurant.
