<div class="hello"><div><p>This town is siuated at the mouth of a river. Good charts are necessary to avoid the off-lying rocks. A night approach is not recomended.</p>
<p>The anchorages are open to easterly through to NE'ly winds but offers good shelter from all other directions. Space for mooring/manovering is limited.</p>
<p>One possible anchorage is immediately to starboard after crossing the bar. A better option is to try and find a place alongside one of the tourist schooners approximately 1/2 mile upstream on the portside. Beware of the stream running at up to 2 kn. It has been known to push boats under the bridge a 1/4 of a mile further upstream!</p>
<p>There are alternative anchorages in Guarapari Bay, 2nm north of the main town, on the western side of the bay. Here the holding is good and there is transport into the main town. One possible anchorage is in Baia da Cerca( rather rolly), another at Ponta do Boiao (safe with little swell in SW winds) and a third at Praia do Meio (small, tricky and for shallow draft boats only).</p>
<p>There are more anchorages in the bay just to the north, Enseda de Perocao.</p>
