<div class="hello"><div><p>Located 15 miles north of <b><a class="external-link" href="../PortoBelo">Porto Belo</a></b>, this is a very welcoming port and a much cheaper alternative for in-town berthing than in Porto Belo.</p>
<p><span>The Port of Itajaí is the main port of the state of Santa Catarina, and the second largest in Brazil in terms of the movement of containers. It has many beautiful beaches, extensive rural areas and stunning natural scenery.</span></p>
<p>In 2013 it was chosen as the arrival port for the Transat Jacques Vabre and the Volvo Ocean Race 2014/15 will be stopping in Itajai in April 2015.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is an official port of Entry for Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="../FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Customs, Immigration and the Port Captain </span><span>are all within walking distance of the pontoon. People are friendly and willing to help. Because not many boats call here, cruisers are treated as a welcome change from everyday routine and cruisers visiting in 2014 reported the paperwork to be quick, easy and very transparent.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>To arrive at the yacht berthing facility in Itajai, you have to follow the river for about a mile. On the port side there is a lagoon which is where a new 320 berth marina is under construction for completion in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span>Just beyond the lagoon on the port side is a pontoon for visiting yachts, between a jetty with a white building at the end and a large concrete jetty with a white tent on it (similar to a circus tent).</span></p>
<p><span>This basic pontoon is in the middle of town with power and water. M</span><span>ooring is stern-to with mooring buoys. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Come 2015 and completion of the marina, it is not clear yet if the pontoon will be used for transient boats and the marina only for resident boats.</span></p>
<p><span><span> All the necessary shops are available within walking distance of the pontoon. Two large supermarkets, department stores, etc. There are three chandlers with limited stock and Brazilian price levels.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Diesel and petrol are available at gas stations. For large amounts of fuel a truck can come to the pontoon.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A WiFi system has been installed but is currently not operational.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>There are good connections by bus to other places in Brazil <span>and fairly easy to go to Blumenau or Iguacu Falls.</span> </span></p>
<p><span>This port is good for repairs with an <span>extensive boat-building and repair industry mostly catering to wooden and steel fishing boats.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Security: </strong>The Marinha do Brazil is located next to the pontoon. They monitor the pontoon with cameras. Furthermore, the pontoon is at the back of a large event centre and adjacent event grounds. These are fenced off and there is a guard 24/7. At night there is a guard who patrols this large area.</span></span></p>
