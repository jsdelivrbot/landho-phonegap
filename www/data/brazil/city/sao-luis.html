<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very attractive town with its original colonial architecture. The town sits on an island where the Mearim and Itapicuru rivers meet the Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Cruisers are urged to take precautions if visiting this port. A Dutch sailor was shot and killed when boarded by armed robbers in February 2015 here. Cees Heim, a Dutch sailor now living in Sao Luis, can provide local advice. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/SaoLuis?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices">General Services</a></strong> for contact details.</p></div></div>

You need hardhats to walk through the port but the locals help, either by giving you hats or arranging transport. Capitania do Portos in town, in the historical center, 30 minutes drive away.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Anchor south of Itaqui, near all the pilot boats and tugs. Good holding in mud. It is possible to tie the dinghy near a sloping ramp and climb the slippery steps to get ashore.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a sort of marina, Marina Aven, which appears to dry out completely at low water and thus only suitable for catamarans or others who can sit on the bottom. They have a dock space for four yachts and (rain?) water is available. The price per night 30R$. An estimate of the coordinates is about 02 30.35 S 44 18.97 W.</span></span></p>
