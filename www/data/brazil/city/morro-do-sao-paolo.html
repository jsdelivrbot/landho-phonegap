<div class="hello"><div><p>There are three good anchorages.</p>
<p>1) In a suitable depth just after passing the large ferry terminal of Morro do Sao Paolo, about 1/2 mile into the estuary. This can be subject to some swell in NE winds and there is a fair amount of passing boat traffic.</p>
<p>2) A more peaceful anchorage is off the village of Gamboa, about 3 miles into the estuary. Anchor in 7 metres in good holding of sand and mud. Beware of the very rapid shoaling towards the shore and the charter boat moorings.</p>
<p>3) A particulary calm anchorage is to be found amother 1/2  mile beyond Gamboa, at Curral.</p>
<p>The approach is straight forward, but going up to Gamboa is best done in daylight. Where the channel narrows, it deepens. The sand banks on the eastern side are steep-to, those to the west shelve more gradually and need watching.</p>
<p>There is a riverside trail from Gamboa to Morro but it is not regarded as safe for use by foreigners due to the ajoining neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The yacht club previously operating in Morro has been closed due to the large number of thefts. It is advisable to pay a <code>minder</code> when using a dinghy to visit the town. The is a rickety wooden jetty and bar on the site of the yacht club.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use a bright anchor light as the crowded school boats start before first light.</p>
