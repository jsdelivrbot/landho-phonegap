<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an archipelago of 21 tropical islands and islets about 220 miles from the Brazilian coast. It is a World Heritage Site and a protected marine park. A very useful stop if coming accross the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Position 3°51’S, 32°25’W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Read<a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</p>
<p>This is now an official port of entry and yachts are expected to arrive with all the appropriate visas. However, although all the other paperwork can be dealt with, it is not possible to clear Customs here. It is reported that this does not present a problem if it is done at the next port of call.</p>
<p>Once anchored, go ashore to deal with clearance. Arriving yachts must clear with the port captain's office, Park Administration (I.B.A.M.A.) and Immigration.</p>
<p>Report to the office at the root of the mole. The Polica Fereral will then come to the same office to complete all paperwork making this a most convenient, if expensive, place to enter Brazil.</p>
<p>It is best to be very clear about you next port of call and your expected date of departure from Brazil. You can always change your mind, but they cannot deal with uncertainties here.</p>
<p>The Port official is very helpful regarding information and obtaining local cash.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The best place to anchor is in Baia de Santo Antonio, just off the breakwater, which provides protection for the dinghy when landing. However, this anchorage is reported to be rolly. In the winter months (July) the seas here are generally calm.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts are also allowed to anchor along the shore between the harbour and the twin islands of Dois Irmaos. This is the only area in the National Park with no anchoring restrictions.</p>
<p>Anchor in 10 to 14m over hard sand (and rock).</p>
<p>Both anchoring fees and Park fees are charged. Anchoring fees are charged from arrival; US$82/day (in 2014). The National Park fee (Enviromental fee) is not charged for the first day, but there is a fee per person, per day thereafter (US$20/day/person in 2014).</p>
<p><span> If you want to see the sights you need to rent a buggy (150 Reais) and must buy an entry pass for another 150 for each person.</span></p>
<p>Get current information on the regulations from the Port Captain's office as there are strict controls on anchoring and dinghy landings.</p>
<p>Beware of the many long floating mooring warps left by the many dive boats which operate from 07:00 each day.  In the harbour the warps become worse, nothing short of a cat's cradle.</p>
<p><span>The Rocas atoll, 85 miles west of Fernando De Noronha is a marine park and one is not allowed to anchor or fish there.</span></p>
