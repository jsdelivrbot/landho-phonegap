<div class="hello"><div><p>This very attractive city was founded by the Portuguese in the 16th centry. Rio was the capital of Brazil until 1960 when Brasilia took over. It is famous for its spectacular setting as well as its carnival. It also has many beautiful beaches including the well-known Copacabana and Ipanema. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span><span>At present (2016 Olympics and corresponding city reconstruction), Rio is a very difficult place to undertake clearance. It is extremely expensive and yachts who have tried to clear-into the country here have reported that officials are very unfriendly. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/AngradosReis">Angra dos Reis</a></strong> (80 miles West) is also in the province of Rio de Janeiro, is a port of entry and has helpful officials who speak English. All authorities are within walking distance of the port.</span></p>
<p>Clearance formalities in Rio must be undertaken in the commercial harbour, which yachts cannot enter. First yachts must moor in a marina (extremely expensive) and go to the necessary offices by public transport. Marina da Gloria is the most conveniently located for a visiting yacht and the office will help with instructions as the various offices are best visited by taxi.</p>
<p>If moving across the harbour to Niteroi, be sure to clear out of Rio first.</p>
<p><strong>Notice June 2016:</strong> See recent comment at bottom of page by a cruiser who tried to clear in here and had numerous problems, including costs for Marina da Gloria.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several anchorages and marinas in Rio de Janeiro, one of the most conveniently situated being Marina da Gloria close to Rio's smaller airport. The marina is very crowded with local boats, but space is usually found for visitors, although facilities are limited and prices very high.</p>
<p>Another option is to anchor off the Royal or "Botafogo" YC. They make a charge for use of their moorings and facilities.</p>
<p>Alternatively, mooring at <strong><a href="Countries/Brazil/Niteroi">Niteroi</a> </strong>on the eastern side of this large harbour is possibly a cheaper and safer option.</p>
