            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Salvador de Bahia is situated in a large bay (Baia de Todos os Santos) which offers a multitude of marinas and anchorages.</p>
<p>Cruisers are warned not to visit secluded anchorages in the Bahia de Todos os Santos. There is a notice to this effect (June 2012) posted at the Aratu Yacht Club to advise their members - who are Brazilian.</p>
<p>It is also strongly recommended that, unless taking up a berth in one of the marinas, vessels should avoid anchoring in the Port area where several armed boardings and robberies have taken place.</p>
<p>That said, an armed boarding, assault and robbery occurred at <span>Itaparica Island in April 2014 (see report adjacent), so great care should be taken when anchoring in this area.</span></p>
<p>The historic centre of the town, which is within walking distance of the marinas, is worth visiting for its remarkable and well restored colonial buildings. Be very aware of street crime here and use common sense (no flashy jewelry etc.).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Salvador is not cheap.</p>
<p>Position 12°57.3'S, 38°30.3'W.</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p>For clearance, all the offices are located in the main port. You will be required to check in with the Policia Federal before you proceed to the Capitania Dos Portos. The Policia Federal is located next to the Receita Federal in the main port, ten minute walk from the Capitania. Enter the waterfront side of the port at the passenger terminal (about 200 meters further down), and then backtrack along the waterside of the port to the Policia Federal office (hours 9-12/2-5 Mon-Fri and 9-12 Sat).</p>
<p>Checking in with the Policia Federal is mandatory here.</p>
<p>Be sure to wear long trousers or you might be refused service.</p>
<p>The staff at both marinas are most helpful and will advise about formalities, as will Marcelo Brocchini of MB yacht services.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are unable to stay in a marina here, a safer option for clearance is to anchor at the NW tip of Itaparica, across the Bay from Salvador. There appears to be no enforcement by the authorities for the requirement to check-in immediately on arriving in Salvador. Once established at<strong> <a href="Countries/Brazil/IlhadeItapercica">Itaparica</a></strong> it is an easy ferry trip across to Salvador to complete entry formalities.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach is straight forward and deep, but with surprisingly strong currents in the middle of the bay and also at the northern end. The night approaches are well marked to all the marinas. Beware of wrecks off the cape on the eastern side of the entrance to the bay.</p>
<p>TTNB at Forte de Sao Marcello, is a good choice if you wish to be close to the city (and your draft is 2m or less) but do be aware that theft of loose items on deck can be a problen here.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Bahia Marina (1 nm to the east of TTNB) is best if you want to leave the boat for a while, however visitor space here is limited.</p>
<p>A quieter spot would be NW of Itaperica, either anchorage or marina. note however that a boat was boarded here and the crew assaulted and robbed, in April 2014 (see report adjacent). The anchorage close to the Fort offers good protection and the holding is good in mud, however there is only a very dodgy beach at which to leave the dinghy and the moorings appear to be run by the guy that does the laundry and odd jobs in the marina.</p>
<p>Another option is one of the marinas in the bay north of the city.</p>
<p>At Aratu, a small bay about 10 miles north of the city, a new marina is being built. Accessed by a well buoyed and deep channel. It will have haulout facilities. There is also a yacht club here which welcomes visitors and is a good place to leave your boat if travelling inland with easy airport connections. They advise against anchoring here.</p>
<p>It is also recommended not to anchor off the marinas in the port area of Salvador where a number of boardings and armed robberies have taken place.</p>
<p><b>Leaving your boat in Salvador</b></p>
<p><span> There are only three marinas here licensed to keep foreign boats when the owner is not in Brazil. These are Terminal Nautico, Pier Marina and Aratu Iate Clube.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>If leaving your boat on its own, you will have to complete a form with the marina and have it verified with the Capitania dos Portos. You will then have to visit the Receite (Customs) to get an extension to the existing 90 day permit for as long as you want (within a two year period). On </span><span>returning to Brazil you will be given a 90 day stay for you and the boat from your date of entry.</span><span> It is likely the marina will also want you to employ a </span><span>local person to take care of the boat in your absence.</span></p>

      Half a day’s sail from Salvador, Aratu Iate Clube is the biggest nautical club in Bahia, offering fully serviced berthing and club facilities. Very convenient for airport connections. It is recommended to arrive here during daylight. The approach channel is narrow and the yacht club is not well marked on chart plotters. Furthermore there are some small marinas that are not charted at all that can be quite confusing at night.
