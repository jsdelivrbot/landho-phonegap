<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the port of departure for the dive boats visiting the Abrolhos Reefs and is a good place to wait for suitable weather for your own visit. It is about 30NM NW of the Reefs.</p>
<p>Position 17°45'S, 39°10'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to this port is now dredged to 5m at low tide and is marked by several pairs of lit channel buoys as well as lit leading marks.</p>
<p>After passing the lighthouse on your starboard, turn sharp to port into the river of Rio Caravelas, keeping to the southern shore. </p>
<p>Once abeam the <code>Pousada Iate Clube</code> (this is not a Yacht Club but a hotel with a small dock in front!), find a suitable anchorage.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to anchor down stream of the <code>Pousada Iate Clube</code> and make use of the wooden jetty belonging to the Sanuk dive operator to land the dinghy. They may even have a mooring available.</p>
<p>There is also a good pier right in the town with water and fuel and in the quiet season it may be possible to stay here or a night or two.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage for deeper draft boats, is inside the fringing reef (Barra Leste) off the sandy beach north of Caravelas. Here there is good protection from the swell, even in strong easterlies. The holding is good in heavy sand.</p>
