<div class="hello"><div><p>The dock running from the south to the north is extended by a wave
breaker. A working light marks its end, but one should give it
a safe berth and not mix up the lights on Ilheu Grande which is half a
mile further to the east. Once inside the wave breaker it only shallows up slowly. The fishing harbor has its own wave breaker running from the shore in a northeasterly direction. This wave breaker might well be submerged in high
tides. </p>
<p>The yacht anchorage is 3 cable lengths west of  this wave
breaker, north of the Yacht Club. It shallows up almost ¾ of a mile
outside the YC and boats with more than 2m draft will have to stay a
fair bit away from the club. It is quite common that the boat man of the
YC comes out to greet and advise you.</p>
<p>There are only few resident boats on moorings. The Club House, identified by its thatched roof, offers visiting yachts the use of the facilities, a bar, swimming pool, restaurant and very limited repair service. Call on VHF 68 to arrange a mooring.</p>
<p>Ilheus is a big town and all services are available (except hauling
out), though it may take some time to find them. With the Yacht Club
being some 5 km away from the town center, a taxi is recommended,
especially after dark as the area is said to be not very safe.</p>
