      Advisable to call the club for help in the approach. The club has good facilities, showers, restaurant and wifi, but the pontoons are on the Island side, so to get to the club you have to take the club launch or your own dinghy.<br>
The first 3 nights are free, after which it was 60R/night.<br> 
The town is some distance and the bus is the best way there, there are not many from the club but if you walk to the main road there are plenty.
