<div class="hello"><div><p>The only possible mooring on the mainland is in the small basin behind the ferry termnal. Here you berth among the fishing boats. There are no anchorages this side of the channel.</p>
<p>On the island of Sao Sebastiao there are several options of swinging moorings on the west coast, anchoring in front of the village, or in various anchorages around the north and east coasts.</p>
<p>There are several yacht clubs here and most offer a few days free mooring to visitors.</p>
<p>For repairs, supplies, chandlery or banking etc. it is better to moor on the island and take the ferry to the mainland.</p>
