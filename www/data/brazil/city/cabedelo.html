<div class="hello"><div><p>Cabedelo is <span>situated on the extreme eastern point of South America, </span>approximately 100MN south of Natal where the Rio Paraiba enters the sea. It's location makes it a <span>useful arrival/departure point for Brazil.</span></p>
<p>Entry is possible day or night, as the channel is well marked with buoys. Note however that quite often some of these are not working, so if your first time it's advisable to avoid a night entry.</p>
<p>It is a good place to leave the boat if exploring the interior.</p>
<p>Position 6°57.44’S, 34°50.5’W.</p></div></div>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p>Clearance should be completed within two working days of arrival. The order in which you visit the various officials is important, otherwise, you might have a wasted journey. If one is not available, or your visits take more than one morning (which is very likely!),  just return the next day.</p>
<p>Visit Immigration (Federal Police) first, followed by the Customs (Alfandega) with the ships’papers and the document provided by the police, then the <span>Health Authorities (Vigilancia Sanitaria) with <span>any vaccination documents and finally the </span></span><span>Port Authority with all the papers presented and provided so far and all the documentation previously accumulated. </span></p>
<p>Remember, <b>all</b> the crew has to be present at <b>all</b> the offices and the forms must be filled in, in ink, without any corrections or mistakes.</p>
<p>There is a marina close to Joao Pessoa, capital of Paraíba state. The police visit the marina every day and one can drive with them to check in at Cabedelo where there is also a Customs office and the port captain's office. This is in front of the harbour entrance in Cabedelo.</p>
<p>If Jacare is your first port of call, take the train from the station next to Jacare Wharf to Cabedello (20 minutes). It is now possible to complete all the formalities at the harbour. Alternatively, if staying at the marina here, they will assist you with doing formalities, all very quick and easy, but more costly.</p>
<p>All the authorities are all located inside the port of Cabedelo premises or just in front. The train station is quite near (<span>get out on the right hand side), follow the street parallel to the tracks until the port area, turn right and the port entry is 200m away. Just ask for “Policia Federal”, then for Alfandega””, afterwards for “Capitania dos Portos” and finally for “Vigilancia Sanitaria.”. Remember <span>most offices close between 11.30 am and 2 pm and clearance is only done in the mornings.</span></span></p>
<p>Normally you will be granted a 90 day visa which can be extended for another 90 days, but be sure to get the extension before the initial 90 days expires as there is a fine for each day otherwise.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>This coast is fringed by reefs, so it is important to make for the outer buoy of  the approach channel.</p>
<p><span>The entrance and channel are well marked but not all beacons are lit. The river is also quite wide with several shallow areas, so unless you know the place well it is advisable to do a daytime entry or exit. Jacare Village marina have a list of entry points on their website. </span></p>
<p>Once inside the harbour, keep close to the quay, after  which, move to the centre of the river Paraiba. There is a shoal in front of  Favella and anchoring near here is not recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Jacare</strong></p>
<p>It is best to proceed up the river to Jacare, but beware of the many shoals and  strong currents. It is advisable not to use a "danforth" type anchor as it can  more easily be tripped when the tide turns. Beware of the unlit fishing nets  strung across the river.</p>
<p>At Jacare, yachts can anchor in front of the "yacht club". <span>Although this is no longer a "club", dinghies can be left here during the week.</span></p>
<p>Jacare Yacht Village (or Marina Jacare Village) have much-improved facilities for cruising yachts. <span>You can independently anchor close to the marina or tie up to one of their mooring buoys or docks.</span></p>
<p>What was once a fishing village has now become a busy resort, popular with the  Brazilian jet-set and notorious for its all-night music. Everywhere in Jacare  noise can be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Ribeira</strong></p>
<p>A quieter alternative is Ribeira, nothing more than a collection of adobe  cottages strung out along a rutted track. Hidden from Jacare by an island of  mangroves, it is a peaceful spot, however there are no food shops here. To get  to the supermarkets and other amenities one must cross the river to Jacare. The  city is just a 20 minute train ride.</p>
<p>Ex-cruiser Luciano opened the small marina  <a href="http://www.ribeiraadventureclub.blogspot.com.es/">Ribeira Adventure Club</a> in  March 2010 on the other side of Stuart Island, intended for low-budget cruisers.   Prices are reported to be 40% cheaper than those in Jacare and  facilities basic. Care should be taken as there are sandbanks on  the way to Ribeira.</p>
