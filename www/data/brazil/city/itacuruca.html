<div class="hello"><div><p>This holiday location is a relatively short 50 miles by road from Rio de Janeiro, but rather longer by sea as it is tucked away behind a long sandbar and very much off the beaten track.</p>
<p><span>When entering the Bahia de Sepetiba via the bouyed channel east of Ilha Grande, it is approx 18nm to Itacuruca.</span></p>
<p>Position 22°55'33" South, 43°54'44" West.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A new resort marina is situated here with basic facilities and sheltered berthing. <span>At the western corner of the marina is a public fuel station operated by Petrobras and water is also available here. </span></p>
<p><span>Just outside the marina is a fenced but public area with various small workshops covering outboard repairs, woodwork, inox metal work, fibreglass jobs etc. There is also a small wharf that offers repairs called "Estalheiro" - more information under <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/Itacuruca?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyards</a></b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The safest anchorage here is in the bay more or less opposite the marina close to the small village of "Gamboa". T</span></span></span></span><span>he holding is good and the Island provides good protection when the strong SW is blowing. To get ashore with the dinghy, enter the creek just to the west of the fuel station. There are however plenty of water taxis which can take you ashore and back for a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Be careful not to anchor directly in front of the beach as t</span>he channel between the mainland and the Island of Itacuruca has a strong tidal current of up to 3 knots and the strong SW winds can cause you to drag onto the beach.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>The Town</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Itacuruca is small and pleasant, but only very basic supplies are available. Spare parts may be found in the next city called “Itaguai”. There is a frequent bus connection between Itacuruca and the surrounding towns and villages. </span></span></span></span></p>
