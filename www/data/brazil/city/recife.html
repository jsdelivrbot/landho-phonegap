<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a major port whose entrance is protected by a 2 mile long concrete breakwater. The city is threaded by many rivers and has a huge number of bridges.</p>
<p>Position 8°3′S,34°54′W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Read</span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/FernandodeNoronha/Countries/Brazil?rc=Formalities"> <strong>Brazil Formalities</strong></a><span> for full details on clearing into and out of Brazil.</span></p>
<p>Follow the clearance proceedures as soon as possible, as the marinas will have faxed the "Capitania" to inform them of your arrival.</p>
<p>Or go to the Cabanga Yacht Club, which will assist with clearance formalities. The club can only be reached at high water and even then there is a draft restriction of 2.5 m (8 ft).</p>
<p>Check in is easy at the Capitania Dos Portos. Customs and Health authorities are in the port (about 500m from the Pernambuco Yacht Club) and the Marine authorities are in the old quarter across the waterfront from the club.</p>
<p>Checking in with the Policia Federal is only necessary when entering or leaving the country. Their office is <span> in the docks, but it is in a restricted area and not even taxis are allowed. You need to go to a pedestrian entrance in Avenida Militar (near Fort Brum), show your passport to security and you will find PF and Customs a short walk inside.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour entrance is most easily identified by the cargo ships which are often anchored outside the entrance. Once through the harbour entrance turn to port and follow along the breakwater. The <span>Pernambuco Yacht Club is to port after about 1.5m. This area is rather remote from the city.</span></p>
<p><span>The <span>Iate Clube do Recife is also on the port side about another half mile further along.</span></span></p>
<p>The Cabanga Yacht Club is further up the river on the sta'bd side by the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Anchoring is only permitted in the designated area. Principally, this is in front of the Pernambuco Yacht Club in mud. The current can be strong and holding poor, with lots of rubbish in the water. The club is open for lunch and offers security day and night.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong><br/> Pernambuco Yacht Club has mooring buoys, which are often full, and a floating pontoon. The approach channel has been dredged to 9m. This is a friendly club with a bar and restaurant, showers and toilets. It runs a dinghy service into the town, but if returning late, then a taxi is the safest way back.</p>
<p>The Recife YC has both mooring buoys and berths.</p>
<p>Another option is the Cabanga Yacht Club. Here boats are moored between piles. The club can only be reached at high water and even then there is a draft restriction of 5 ft (1.6 m). The Club runs a launch service and can also assist in clearance procedures. It has water and electricity, a swimming pool and two restaurants. It is reported to be expensive.</p>

      The yacht club will shortly be installing 3 floating pontoons, in the meantime, yachts can use the mooring buoys or anchor. Depth in channel is 9m. Water available for filing the tanks and showers. Bottled water is also available.  Ferry to the city side of the river. Currently, it is possible to carry out some repairs alongside the floating pontoon (above half tide) but soon hauling out and boatyard facilities will be available. Restaurant (open Wed-Sun 11:00 – 17:00. Closed during Carnival.), showers, water, electricity.
