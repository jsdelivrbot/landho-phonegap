<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to this network of rivers is marked with buoys, but beware, as they can be misplaced by storms. The following <a href="www.cananet.com.br/centronautico/waypoints.html">website</a> has more details.</p>
<p>Anchor in mud north of the ferry dock in about 4m, near the Cananeia Gloria hotel. It is possible to land at the ferry dock and leave the dinghy there.</p>
<p>There is a very useful fuel dock at Central Nautico who have a small dock where you can leave your dinghy safely as they have 24hr security. </p>
<p>It is also possible to moor a little way off this dock and land your dinghy there. Although it is outside the town, it is much quieter than off the town quay, where there are a lot of tripper and fishing boats. </p>
