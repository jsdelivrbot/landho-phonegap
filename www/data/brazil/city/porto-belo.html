<div class="hello"><div><p>Located just north of Florianopolis, this area is very quiet and beautiful. The Yacht Club however is prohibitively expensive. A good, much more reasonable alternative, is <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Brazil/itajai">Itajai</a> </strong>which is 15 miles north. It is not mentioned in any pilot book.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a yacht club here with good facilities. Take care if asked to tie alongside the outer wall as the pier is tall and the lower freeboards of sailing vessels make this not a good choice. There are slips available to members only inside the pier.  </p>
<p>Cruisers have reported to feel very safe walking around the neighboring areas. There is a good mechanic at the yacht club and nearby repair facilities. </p>
<p>Provisioning is fair here.</p>
