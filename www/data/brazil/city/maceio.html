<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage in the east of Playa de Jaragua, in front of the local yacht club. To approach it, go past the commercial port and go to the small boat moorings.</p>
<p>There is also a local guy who will direct you to a buoy, although he might paddle out in a canoe and look a little scruffy, his moorings are good and he can be very useful for water, diesel and provisions. </p>
<p>The yacht club is very friendly and welcoming and will advise about the formalities at the Capitania del Puerto and Policia Federal, as well as providing toilets and showers. In their compound is a safe place to leave your dinghy.</p>
<p>Always use a taxi after dark even if it´s for a short distance, mostly around the town they are about 6R.</p>
