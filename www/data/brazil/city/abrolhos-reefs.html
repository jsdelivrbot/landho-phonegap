<div class="hello"><div><p>The Abrolhos reef complex is located off the northeastern coast of Brazil and it is the largest and richest coral reefs in the south Atlantic.</p>
<p>Approaching this area of dangerous reefs and islands, requires caution and a good light, preferable from behind you. It is not wise to rely on charts, which may not be entirely up to date (including electronic versions).</p>
<p>The main island is Santa Barbara. The lighthouse and the rangers are based here. There are two smaller islands, Isla Redonda and Isla Siriba connected by a reef.</p>
<p>June to September is the best time to visit as this is the season when the whales come here to breed. A northerly wind will ensure that the southern anchorage is calm. With a wind from a southerly or easterly direction - none of the anchorages are comfortable.</p>
<p>Position 17°58'S,38°42'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival, call "Farol de Arolhos" (the park ranger) on VHF channel 16. They will instruct you where to pick up a mooring buoy or possibly anchor.</p>
<p>There is a charge per person for mooring here and you MAY NOT land on either the islands or the reefs without a ranger being present. Agree the price for an island tour with the ranger beforehand.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Substantial moorings have been laid by the government and boats are obliged to use them if directed by the park ranger, to avoid damage to the coral. However, it is wise to check on your mooring before relying on it completely.</p>
<p>Mooring buoys are reported NE of Siriba, NW of Siriba, and S of Santa Barbara (1/4 mile E of the Lighthouse).</p>
<p>The Abrolhos Reefs are a nature reserve, therefore fishing, collecting and hunting are strictly forbidden. Diving and snorkeling are permitted, but beware of the currents.</p>
