<div><p><i>Formalities here are simple, but should be done in working hours. No overtime is charged, but clearance on weekends is only done by arrangement.</i></p>
<p>It is advisable to read <a href="http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ST-HELENA-Harbour-information-for-yachts.pdf"><strong>Information for Yachts</strong></a> before visiting the island.</p>
<p><strong>On Approach</strong><br/> When 10 to 20 nautical miles from James Bay, call St. Helena Radio on VHF channel 16 and announce your impending arrival and ETA in James Bay and request Clearance.</p>
<p><span> </span><span>Fly the Q </span><span>flag until clearance has been completed.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align:justify; ">Yachts may be boarded by Port Authority/Immigration/Customs officers <strong>or</strong> you may be directed to report ashore at an appointed time.</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align:justify; ">The visitors’ moorings are allocated by the Harbourmaster. Should you arrive during normal working hours, try calling on VHF Channel 14 and speak to him directly as you arrive.</p>
<p><span><span>The Harbourmaster will direct you to one of the numbered moorings, dependent on your LOA and tonnage. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you arrive out of hours or have difficulty contacting the Harbourmaster, inform St Helena Radio who will assist you in making contact. Should you arrive during the night and the Harbourmaster is not available, you may pick up any free red/yellow buoy until morning. You will find a 25mm galvanised mooring ring on the buoy, to which you should attach your own mooring lines. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align:justify; "><span>Please note that <strong>only</strong> the Harbourmaster or Assistant Harbourmaster are empowered to allocate or direct yachts to a particular mooring. St Helena Radio, Police Officers, Immigration Officers or Customs Officers  may give directions in an emergency. Do not take directions from any other person.</span></p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StHelena/Jamestown?rc=PortProfile#Docking">Jamestown Docking</a></strong> for detailed information on the mooring field and anchoring options. <span>Care should be taken to approach the field from the West and not through the local boats due to a large number of substantial mooring lines and painters for the local fishing boats. </span>If arriving at night be aware that local boats, either at anchor or on moorings, do not show any lights.</p>
<p><strong>Checking In<br/></strong></p>
<p><span>The</span><strong> Immigration </strong><span>office is situated on the right side of the church. Opening times are Monday to Friday from 08.00hrs to 16.00hrs.</span></p>
<p><strong>St. Helena Port Control</strong> can be contacted on VHF Channel 14 and is situated on the wharf in the same building as <strong>Customs</strong> (white building with a clock tower next to the pool). The office opening times are Monday to Friday from 08.30hrs to 16.00hrs.</p>
<p>If you arrive outside of these hours you may be required to stay on board your vessel until the offices re-open which may mean remaining on board overnight.  On call arrangements are in place on weekends.</p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StHelena/Jamestown?rc=PortProfile#Docking">Jamestown Docking</a> </strong>for information on getting ashore by ferry.</p>
<p><span>As a special concession, no fees (except light dues) are charged if staying less than 72 hours. See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StHelena?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong><span> for details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Health Insurance</strong><br/><span>You need a copy of your health insurance certificate for Immigration. If you require insurance, it can be purchased locally at <span>Solomons’ Insurance Office.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Checking Out<br/></strong><span></span></p>
<p>All visitors must check out with Customs and Immigration before leaving the island. If leaving on the weekend the checking out procedure must be completed on the Friday before departure.</p>
