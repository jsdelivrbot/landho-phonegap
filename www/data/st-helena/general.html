<p><b>Water</b></p>
<p>There are four drinking water taps/faucets located within 10 metres of the wharf landing.  The tap at the top of the steps has a hose which makes it quick and easy for filling water jugs.  The water is free (part of your port dues).</p>

<div><p>St Helenian pound (£) of 100 pence, fixed at parity with £ sterling. Sterling currency can be used everywhere; change is given in St. Helena Pounds.</p>
<p><span>Before leaving all money should be changed back to sterling, as the notes are not valid outside of St. Helena and Ascension Island.</span></p>
<p>There is one bank in Jamestown. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/StHelena/Jamestown?rc=ShoreServices#Banks">Banks</a></strong> for further info. It's easy to get caught out here as there are no ATMs. <span>The bank can do cash advances on Visa or Mastercard but there is a service charge.</span></p>
<p><span>A few shops and businesses do accept credit cards. </span><span>The Yacht Club and the Consulate Hotel accept credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers however recommend that the easiest solution is to arrive in St Helena with <span>Pound Sterling from South Africa. </span></span></p></div>

<p><span>Sure (ex. Cable &amp; Wireless) now offers 2G and 4G LTE mobile network. Prepaid SIM cards can be purchased in their office in Jamestown. Data bundles are available and reception (internet usage) is now possible on board. 4G internet is very fast, but expensive comparing to other countries and cheaper than WiFi hot spots on island if it is not used for large data transfers.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>Buses</strong></p>
<p>The public transport system on St Helena is fairly new and has a very limited service. White buses marked with Route A, B, C, D, or E cover the entire island.  The maximum fare is £2, (about $3 USD) each way per person.  The Tourist Office will give you a copy of the bus schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Hitch-Hiking</strong></p>
<p>Another way to get around the island is to hitch-hike:  This is one of the few places on the planet were hitch-hikers can easily obtain a safe ride.  Getting a lift shouldn't take you long.</p>
<p><strong>Car Hire</strong></p>
<p>Visitors have the option of booking tours through the Tourist Office, car rental or taxis.</p>
<p>It costs £12-15 per day to hire a car and driving is not difficult with the speed limit only 40mph, but prepare to use your horn.Driving is on the left hand side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>Taxis</strong></p>
<p>The main taxi stand is behind the tourist office and another by the main jetty. Taxis are un-metred so agree a price before taking a ride.</p>
<p>Various taxis offer tours of the island (at £6 per person). Corker’s Tours ( <a href="CorkersTouristService@helanta.sh">email</a> ) have a 1929 Chevrolet bus for larger groups.</p>
<p><strong>Airport</strong></p>
<p>The U.K. government decided in 2010 that the long term economic independence of the island would be best served by the building of an airport. This was due to open in May 2016 however problems have been encountered with high winds, so it is currently still not open for commercial flights.</p>
<p>Sadly, once the airport is open, the current <span>Royal Mail Ship "St Helena" (</span><span>predecessors of </span><span>which have served the island since 1502), may be be retired.</span></p>
