<div><ul>
<li>The island of St Helena lies halfway between Africa and South America, and together with the two other Atlantic islands of <a href="Countries/AscensionIsland"><strong>Ascension</strong></a> and <strong><a href="Countries/TristandaCunha">Tristan da Cunha</a>, </strong><strong>form a<strong><span>n overseas territory of the United Kingdom</span>.</strong></strong></li>
<li>St. Helena has only one harbour called James Bay which now benefits from a new field of robust mooring buoys. The rest of the coast is towering rocky cliffs backed by lush green slopes climbing up to the highest spot on the island, Diana's Peak, at 823 metres.</li>
<li>St. Helena's popularity as a port of call for passenger liners has now been taken over by sailing yachts, a large number of which stop there every year. A warm welcome awaits the visiting sailor ashore in Jamestown, the island's main settlement. </li>

<div id="_mcePaste"><b><i>Getting work done:</i></b> The Island has no real ability to deal with yacht <span>repair. That said the locals are very friendly and </span><span>there are some very skilled engineers who may </span><span>be able to help.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="_mcePaste"><b><i>Provisioning:</i></b> Provisions are limited and expensive. Stock up prior to arrival.</div>
</li>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">The opening of the new airport in May 2016 has been indefinitely postponed due to problems with high winds.</span></li>

<div><p>The climate is tropical, but cooled by the SE trades, and the cold Benguela current from the Southern Ocean. The weather is warm and occasionally humid, but it varies within the island and it is sometimes foggy or misty.</p>
