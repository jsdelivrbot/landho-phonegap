<h2 id="Clearance">
                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><span>In all DR ports, no departure or arrival is permitted after 1800 without special permission obtained from "Comandancia de Puerto" on VHF channel 16. Yachts are also asked not to arrive before 0600, however this is not enforced.</span></p>
<p>If possible, arrive during working hours, 08:00-17:00. Fly the yellow Quarantine Flag when you arrive and also the Dominican Republic Courtesy flag. Wait to be boarded, as it is illegal to land before clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Ports of Entry</strong></p>
<p>To enter the Dominican Republic you must arrive at a “Puerto Habilitado” <span>(Ports that have clearing in and out facilities)</span>.</p>
<p>On the <strong>North Shore</strong> this includes: Manzanillo, Luperon and Puerto Plata. If you arrive at Monticristi, they will send to Manzanillo for Immigration for you.</p>
<p>On the <strong>East Coast</strong> you can clear in or out at Santa Barbara de Samana, as well as Cap Cana and Punta Cana.</p>
<p>On the <strong>South Coast</strong> you can clear in or out at Santo Domingo, Boca Chica and Casa de Campo. At Las Salinas, althoug a Port of Entry, it is best just used for clearing out.</p>
<p><strong>Clearance Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Rules regarding initial clearing in have been simplified, however, fees increased substantially in 2014.</p>
<p><span>Officials to see are: Immigration for the Visa, Coast Guard for papers from previous harbour and despacho to next harbour, Department of Drug Enforcement to check for illegal drugs, M-2 which is Intelligence and who goes along with the drug inspection officer and now Customs.</span></p>
<p><span>Prior to May 2013 Customs agents only handled commercial ships, however, visiting Customs is now a check-in requirement for private pleasure boats (at no charge) - although they might now appear "in person".</span></p>
<p><span><span>All officials will ask for tips throughout the DR. There are places where one clearance fee can be paid that covers all, including tips. In other places there are various "invented" fees, which are outlined on the individual port pages. This custom is a form of "direct tax" as the officials get paid so little per month. </span></span><span>The entire country works on tips and commissions</span><span>, so in short, get accustomed to it or don't sail to the DR. </span></p>
<p>A 90 day cruising permit will be granted on arrival (and can be renewed for an additional 90 days). For details of charges to pay see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong>. Some marinas will offer a clearance service with an all-inclusive charge. Sometimes this is much simpler than visiting all the various offices, which for some can be lengthy and complicated.</p>
<p><span>Any boat that comes into a DR harbor is under DR jurisdiction.  If they do not want to stay, the authorities may permit them to depart provided they have not set foot on land.  If they have set foot on land, then they must clear in and clear out.</span></p>
<p><span><span> The DR is concerned about illegal emigration and drug smuggling, however m</span>ost cruising boats are not boarded or searched.  However, if a boat meets a profile, such as men-only on board and having come from Jamaica, it most likely will be searched for drugs.  The DR is close to the US and is required by agreements to search every boat that wants to head for the USA as its next stop.  The search is a few minutes for virtually all boats.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Moving Harbour to Harbour within the DR</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Coast Guard (</span><span>Marina Guerra)</span><span> issues the Despacho from harbour to harbour. Despacho's are issued only to "Puertos Habilitado" (Ports that have clearing in and out facilities). Stopping between official ports may be done with your Despacho provided you have a reason, such as needing to take a rest, mechanical work etc. There is no official charge for the Despacho, but it is usual to offer a tip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Departure Clearance</strong></span></p>
<p>When you are ready to leave the DR, you must get an international Despacho from Marina Guerra (Coastguard). Again there is no charge, but a tip is customary.</p>
<p>Note that once you have been issued with a Despacho, <strong>you must depart within 1 hour</strong> or your Despacho will be taken away and you will have to obtain a new one the next day.</p>
<p><span>If you are departing for the USVI, Puerto Rico or the US mainland, this rule is very strongly enforced and the authorities will also bring drug dogs to search the boat prior to departure..</span></p>
<p>In some ports, Despacho conditions might be more relaxed if you are simply moving to the next port with a domestic Despacho.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><span>All harbours in the DR are on heightened alert </span><span>as the vigilance against drug runners has increased, </span><span>which</span><span> can at times cause a short delay when clearing in or out.</span></li>
<li><span>Several ports are best to avoid, unless one has special permission (e.g., Puerto Plata's commercial harbour and Azua).</span></li>
<li><span>Some of the intermediate ports get more traffic and the officials at those ports are easier to deal with. Some ports or anchorages like Punta Macao on the east end, have a reputation for asking for a fee for stopping, although such requests do not have to be honoured.</span></li>
<li><span>See this <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic/fees-for-cruising-boats-in-the-dr/">Useful Clarification of Fees in the DR</a></b> by Frank Virgintino, which explains very well how the system works here for visiting cruising yachts.</span></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>If wishing to stay for more than 6 months</strong></p>
<p>For stays of longer than 90 days, foreign-flagged yachts may have to apply for a "Certificate of Navigability" in order to obtain a despacho to leave the country. <span>The cost for the Certificate is more or less $20 US per foot. </span><span>Once the fee is paid, a "Certificate of Navigability" is issued for one year which is renewable. </span></p>
<p><span><span>The best way to get this Certificate is in Santo Domingo at the central Coast Guard Office (expect to pay a tip), not at the local port.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In certain cases t</span>he issuing of this certificate includes a criminal records background check, therefore your departure is likely to be delayed if application for it is not made at the right time.</p>
<p>No such certificate is required for stays of less than 90 days.</p>

<div><p>All visitors must have a valid passport.</p>
<p>For most nationals, a 30 day Tourist Card is issued on arrival. It is easily renewable. Citizens of Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Israel, Japan, Perú, South Korea and Uruguay do not require a Tourist Card or a visa.</p>
<p>See<strong> <a href="http://www.dominicanembassy.org.uk/Touristcard.html">here</a> </strong>for a list of countries covered by a Tourist Card.</p>
<p>If wishing to renew the Tourist Card after 30 days, fees are payable depending on how long you wish to stay in the country. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> below for details.</p>
<p>If a visa is required, all applications must be authorised by the authorities in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. The Dominican Republic is an area of interest with reported cases and possible active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<div><p>There is going to be a new vessel entrance form that will be filled out with the vessel, crew and passenger information. This will be given to all governmental authorities and one copy to the captain of the vessel as proof of entry and clearance when traveling <strong>between marinas</strong> in the DR. This document is still being made by the marinas and needs to be approved by the Dominican Port Authority.</p>
<p>If you want to re-flag your boat under the DR, you will have to pay import tax.  It is high because there is a tax of about 30% followed by a selective import tax on top of that of another 20%.  With sales tax then added of 16%, this is a pricey option. Most well off Dominicans that are in the yacht clubs, have their boats with an American Flag. They pay $43 to bring their boat into the country and then every year they pay a foreigner renewal fee of $300 or so.<!--Info from FV, I thought interesting to add--></p>

                Fees
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><strong>Arrival Fees</strong></p>
<p>The only official fees that cruisers must pay when clearing into the DR are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>US$73</span><span> - a one-off fee per boat (for the 90 day cruising permit).</span></li>
<li><span>US$18</span><span> for a 30-day Tourist Card per person.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fees are paid to Immigration and a receipt issued.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The coast guard, along with M-2 (Intelligence) and Department of Drugs may board on arrival. There is no charge for their services or for that of Customs (however it is normal to give a tip).</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Renewal Fees</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Tourist cards</i></strong> can be renewed as follows:<br/><span>30 days to 3 months: $2,500 pesos<br/>3-9 months: $4,000 pesos<br/>9-12 months: $5,000 pesos<br/></span><span>And so on, up to 10 years. </span></p>
<p><strong>Domestic Clearance Fees</strong></p>
<p><span>Despachos from port to port will be required and will be administered by the Coast Guard. Officially, there is no charge for them, however we have been advised that a tip for this service of $15 (for domestic zarpe) and $25 (for an international zarpe) is customary and normally requested. For an international zarpe to the US or US posession, a higher tip of US$50 is the norm as this is a more complicated procedure.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Fees</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Whilst overall the authorities in the DR are showing greater compliance with the official rate list, there are some ports (such as Samana and Luperon) where a number of unofficial fees are still being charged - such as harbour entrance fees, anchoring fees, garbage disposal, pet landing fees etc.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><i>Crew Lists: </i></strong><span>There is a fee to enroll or disenroll crew if they want to leave the boat and fly out: US$20. This is only charged for crew who were on board on arrival in the DR. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><i>Harbour Charges:</i></strong> Individual harbours may assess fees for such services as garbage collection or for an agricultural inspection, or for entry into the bay (US$10).</p>
<p><strong><i>Department of Ports:</i></strong> The DOP may also request an anchoring charge although they  have no jurisdiction to do so. They can only charge for use of a government dock. This fee is US$.70 cents per foot for each 24 hours, whether you stay for one hour or 24 hours.</p>
