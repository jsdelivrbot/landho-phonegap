<div class="hello"><div><p>Las Salinas de Bani lies 28nm east of Barahona, in the SE corner of the bay of las Calderas.  This bay is a great place for waders and shorebirds. Salinas is an area that includes salt mines, mangroves, sand dunes, and thorn scrub. It is an undeveloped part of the coast, but the Calderas Bay provides good protection.</p>
<p>WARNING: Approaching Punta Calderas on the way into Las Salinas, there is a fish farm or similar structure marked by yellow buoys. (February 2010).</p>
<p>Position 18°13.1'N, 70°31.1'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees</span></p>
<p>This is a Port of Entry, however it is more accustomed to dealing with commercial vessels and it may be advisable to clear in at a port more used to yachts.</p>
<p>Currently, Las Salinas will not clear vessels OUT internationally; they refer them to <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic/Barahona">Barahona</a></strong>.  However, they will clear vessels IN internationally and for those cruising the country for a local despacho.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The channel across the bay is marked by buoys.</p>
<p>The bay is very windy, but does offer good protection. Holding is good, particularly in front of the Hotel Salinas, however be sure to put out plenty of chain.</p>
<p>At the Hotel Salinas t<span>here are some privately owned berths which may be available to rent if free, however few services for cruisers.</span></p>
<p>It is also possible to leave the dinghy at the hotel pontoon.</p>
<p>The depth at the pontoon is 2.5m.</p>
