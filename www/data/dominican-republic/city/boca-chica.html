<div class="hello"><div><p>Boca Chica is a resort town just a 30 min drive from the capital city of Santa Domingo, where you can visit the first colonial city in the new world. Santa Domingo has much to offer. Just 5 miles west of Boca Chica is the Las Americas International Airport.</p>
<p>Boca Chica has lovely beaches and a lively nightlife. <span>At weekends there is a great deal of local power boats passing through the anchorage playing loud music, so don't expect peace and quiet!</span></p>
<p>Buoyage has just been upgraded here (all charts are out of date; most particularly the leading lights have been replaced by a first rate RWG sectored light) and is now excellent (and lit) - but the passage does involve passing disconcertingly close to breaking waves to starboard!. On entry to the leisure port it is essential to keep very close to the moored boats on the port side to avoid shallows to starboard.</p>
<p><span>La Caleta is a Marine National Park just a few miles west of Boca Chica often used by cruising boats as an easy access anchorage for overnighting. </span><span>The "Medio Ambiente" (Environmental Protection Department) have now initiated an order (March 2013) that no anchoring will be permitted here due to the possiblity of damage to the reef.  Additionally, no overnight stays will be permitted at the park. There are moorings for boats to use during the day only, for those that want to scuba in the area.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that it is not possible to depart the harbour after 18:00hrs and arrival after dark is not advisable. Cruisers have reported that they encountered difficulties contacting anyone on the VHF after 17:00hrs on the approach to Boca Chica.</span></p>
<p><span>Position <span>18°25.50'N, 69°36.67'W (marina)</span></span></p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees.</span></p>
<p><span>There are full time Immigration and Customs officials based at Marina Zar Par. The official offices </span><span>are open 24 hours per day, however, pleasure boats are serviced between 0800 and 1800.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, boats may not depart before sun-up and may not depart after 6pm.</span></span></p>
<p>Bear this in mind when planning your departure clearance. Rules in the DR are that yachts must leave directly after clearing out. The officials here are very strict about this, and you must leave <i><strong>immediately</strong></i> after your despacho has been issued.</p>
<p>The marina provides their fuel dock as a clearance dock to complete paperwork. If you are there for any length of time however, and not taking a slip/buoy in the marina, then they will charge for use of the dock.</p>
<p><span>The officials you need to see on entering are: The Coast Guard, Drug enforcement, M-2 Customs and Immigration.</span></p>
<p>Clearance can be complicated and lengthy, however cruisers are free to undertake clearance themselves if they wish. It is unlikely the marina will offer you this option, however if you wish to do so, insist on not using their service.</p>
<p><span>First visit Immigration in the marina and then go to the Coast Guard and the other officials. </span><span>Expect it to take around half a day with transport costs for between offices.</span></p>
<p>The marina's "clearance service" is a flat rate of <span>$250.00 US. This includes two visas at US$15 each plus <span>US$73 for the boat plus departure fees. The balance goes to the 4 agencies involved in the form of gratuities and for transport to and from the Coast Guard office twice (once to bring the despacho from the prior harbor and again to get the despacho the day the boat leaves). </span></span></p>
<p><span>The visas are good for 30 days and if you stay over, you can pay a small additional fee when you depart.</span></p>

<p><strong><i>There is one permitted anchorage in Boca Chica for visiting yachts</i></strong>, at the island across from the Yacht Club (see docking notes below for details). Yachts can proceed here after clearance if they prefer not to use the marina facilities, or anchor here prior to clearance and proceed to the marina by dinghy for clearance with officials.</p>
<p><span><span>For clearing out, t</span><span>he marina indicates that only those that are cleared to exit and cannot depart due to the time of day (i.e. after 6pm), may stay overnight on the fuel dock (no electric) and not pay.</span></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>It is advisable to arrive in Boca Chica during the day when all clearance offices are open. </span><span>If arriving at night, the security guard will help you tie to the fuel dock (note he only speaks Spanish) and the authorities may, or may not come down to the boat. Some, or all, may wait until the morning. Note the launch service for guidance into the marina is not available at night.</span></p>
<p><span>Most boats are not boarded and searched.  However, if a boat meets a profile, such as men only and having come from Jamaica, it most likely will be searched for drugs. The DR is close to the US and is required by agreements to search every boat that wants to head for the USA as its next stop.  The search is a few minutes for virtually all boats.</span></p>

<p><span>There is a well marked channel to follow into the bay past the megaport. </span></p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><span>The only designated anchorage in Boca Chica for visiting yachts is located behind the island of "La Piedra" opposite the private yacht club. </span><span>As one enters the bay, past the megaport the yacht club is the first facility on the port side. Opposite the yacht club is "La Piedra" where people do anchor and anchoring is permitted</span><span>. </span><span>It is not a large area and space is very limited, perhaps room for 3 regular sized boats</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Further east in the bay on the port side is Marina ZarPar and there are moorings in front of the marina. There is a public beach further east. <span>No anchoring is allowed in front of the public beach or the marina, although you may well see local boats doing just that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/47b65c5ec97c4e2eb06b3c1511852b63/@@images/image/preview"/>Further out in the "channel area" the marina also has moorings.  These moorings are for rent and they are given free to local boats who use the area to swim on the weekends.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The photo shows the anchorage at Isla La Piedra and is taken looking west from the marina's T head dock. The boat in the immediate foreground is on a mooring in front of the marina. No anchoring is permitted here as it is both a channel to permit pilotage east along the front of the marina and a mooring field.</span></span></p>
<p><span>There is a shallow sandbar that curves in towards the docks of the private yacht club and Marina Zar Par.</span></p>

<p><strong>Marine Zarpar</strong><br/><span>In front of the marina are a number of </span><strong>mooring balls</strong> available for visiting yachtsmen. There is a daily charge for use of the mooring ball which includes, dinghy dock, hot water showers and bathrooms, captains club, security, free transportation to supermarkets and town, waste oil disposal, WiFi etc.</p>
<p>The marina will no longer permit boats larger than 50' on the moorings due to risk of going aground. The lines attached to the mooring balls can occasionally be missing due to theft by local fisherman or a large powerboat running over them. Please advise the marina if you find this to be the case.</p>
<p>One yacht reported being broken into on these mooring balls in 2013. It is easy for opportunists to swim out from the beach or island without being seen. Since then, the marina have employed extra security to watch the moorings and no further break-ins have been reported.</p>
<p>Advanced reservations are recommended for slips in the marina. The marina monitors VHF Ch.5 and will send a launch to guide you in from the end of the well marked commercial channel. This service is not available at night and cruisers have reported experiencing difficulties with VHF contact on approach.</p>
<p><span>There is a shuttle bus from a square a few minutes walk from the marina which goes to the village of Boca Chica.</span></p>
