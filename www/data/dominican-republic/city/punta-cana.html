<div class="hello"><div><p>Punta Cana is on the extreme eastern tip of the island. It is a popular tourist resort and is well known for both its beaches, surf and golf courses.</p>
<p><span>Whilst clearance here is straightforward as the marina organises everything, this port is not ideal for cruising boats unless conditions are very settled. <span>Marina Punta Cana is populated by mostly fishing craft and has a very difficult entrance channel that is shallow. Whilst the channel is reasonably well marked, it's very tricky in windy conditions. Inside the marina the tidal surge can be extreme.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Alternative nearby clearance ports are <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic/Samana">Samana</a></strong> to the north and <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic/CasadeCampo">Casa de Campo</a></strong> to the south.</span></p>
<p>Note that some electronic charts (e.g. Navionics) show no detail of the marina here and its entrance.  The buoyed channel can be difficult to see at first as the buoys from the original channel were never removed leaving a confusing array of buoys to the north of the present channel.</p>
<p>The marina provide a pilot service if visibility or conditions are poor. Call them on VHF Ch 16 or 72.</p>
<p><span>Position 18°29.9’N, 68°21.9’W.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees</span></p>
<p><span>Come alongside the fuel dock for clearance. Be sure to have either large balloon fenders or all lines rigged at the ready as officials will come aboard immediately. Latest reports indicate that you will be boarded by 7 or 8 officials who will not remove their shoes.</span></p>
<p>The marina website publishes the current fees payable - have the correct money in US$ as they will not give change.</p>
<p>It is advisable to get the marina to arrange for the departure visit (by the same 7 or 8 officials!) at least an hour earlier than your actual departure time.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Cap Cana resort is a Condo devleopment that was launched at the start of the US recession and has fallen on hard times. They have sold some condos, but the place is not finished. </span></p>
<p><span>The marina was built for mega yachts; however, due to the Mona Passage and shifting sands, the entrance into the marina can be difficult especially when the trade winds are up; it is a lee shore and the waves often break into the entrance. </span></p>
<p><span>The marina is made up of a number of big concrete slips.</span></p>
