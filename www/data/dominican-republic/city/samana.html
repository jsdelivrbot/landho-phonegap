<div class="hello"><div><p>The Samana Peninsula extends almost 30 miles out from the north coast of the Dominican Republic. Santa Bárbara de Samaná (usually called Samana) lies on the southern side overlooking the large bay of Bahia de Samana. This town has an unusual history. It was settled by two shiploads of freed American slaves around 1824 and, to this day, many residents speak English as a first language.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees.</span></p>
<p><i><span> </span><span>Samana has a long history of "made up charges". Officials here currently</span><span> charge for anchoring based on use of the wharf.  They do not have a wharf and the charge is based on a Ports and Harbours charge where a charge is assessed by the government to use the wharf. It is entirely up to you if you don't want to pay this charge, but it may involve alot of time waiting in their office. See comments from cruisers at the bottom of the page.</span></i></p>
<p>On arrival, all the officials will make their way out to your boat to undertake clearance. The process is reported to take time and be rather inefficient here.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The bay here is sheltered and provides a good anchorage, however t</span><span>he harbour is noisy with loud music. Whilst the authorities in Samana are showing <span>greater compliance with the official rate list, there is a charge here to anchor.</span></span></p>
<p><span>There are also some mooring buoys which may be available for a small charge. </span></p>
<p>A new <span>condo development, Puerto Bahia, with slips opened in 2010 a few miles up bay from the harbour, </span><span>4nm west of the town of Samana</span><span>. </span><span>It has a deep entrance channel with inside depths ranging from 9 - 15 ft.</span><span> Services are limited (there are no haulout facilities or resident marine mechanics for example), but it is in nice surroundings. It's a 30 to 40 minutes walk from here in to town.</span></p>
<p>Be sure to lock your dinghy and outboard to the boat at all times. There have been several reported cases of theft and attempted theft in Samana, the last one being in June 2016 (see report adjacent).</p>
<p>Apart from the wonderful beaches, the principle attraction is the incredible sight of hundreds of humpback whales, which during January to March, gather in the bay to mate and nurse their young.</p>
