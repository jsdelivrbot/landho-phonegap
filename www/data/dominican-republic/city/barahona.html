<div class="hello"><div><p>Located 51nm from Isla Beata.<br/> This harbour is commercial and fringed with industrial activity. There are buoys marking the entrance channel to the starboard of a reef which extends offshore. The safest approach is from the east northeast. Once past the entrance buoys there are numerous marker buoys leading the way to the anchorage basin. Take extra caution at night since many of the buoys are unlit.</p>
<p>Although the harbour is commercial and somewhat unsightly the town is good for provisioning.</p>
<p>This is a good place from which to visit Lake Enriquillo, one of the few saltwater lakes in the world inhabited by crocodiles.</p>
<p>Position <span>18°09.21'N, 70°57.13'W</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor in the tranquil mangrove anchorage at the northeast corner of the small basin at the end of the well marked commercial channel. Mud bottom. Dinghies can be parked at the "yacht club".</p>
<p>It is also possible to tie up to the commercial pier jutting out from the town in the southwest corner. There is a charge for this however for a minimum of 24 hours, so only dock if you are willing to pay.</p>
