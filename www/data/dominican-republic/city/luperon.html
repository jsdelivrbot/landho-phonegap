<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/dominican-republic-pics/LuperonDRaerial.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Luperon harbour (also known as Puerto Blanco) is a large enclosed bay providing excellent shelter (hurricane hole). Its position on the north coast, opposite the Turks and Caicos Islands, make it a useful shelter for yachts with southbound cruising plans and <span>is the first and only really major anchorage for boats heading East.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately however, whilst Luperon has a welcoming long-term cruising community, the local Authorities (in the recent past) have not been so friendly towards yachts and "made up" charges seem to increase on an annual basis. Cruisers considering cruising to this port should read all the information below, including feedback from cruisers at the bottom of the page, before deciding if they want to deal with the potential problems that may arise should they visit.</p>
<p>Cruising reports elsewhere on the net in 2016 have been more favourable, so perhaps the "illegal fees" are a thing of the past. A new commandante has been appointed and he appears to be more sympathetic towards the yachting community. Note however that commandantes change on a regular basis in the DR.</p>
<p>Luperon is a small rural town, has markets and hardware stores, discos, a hospital, police, and two dentists.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Whilst the authorities in Luperon have received many negative reports in the past, it does appear in 2016 that they are showing greater compliance with the official rate list (see </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Clearance Fees for the DR</strong></a><span>).</span></span></p>
<p>Anchor anywhere and hoist a Q flag and wait for Dominican entry officials. You will likely be visited by 3 officials: the Military, Immigration and Drug Control. It is customary to offer them a cold soft drink.</p>
<p>After the inspection on board, take your dinghy to the government dock and walk into town to complete paperwork ashore. At the outskirts, to the left is a path leading to a small bridge and the hilltop naval outpost. The commandante will record your presence, giving you legal permission to land.</p>
<p>All officials are situated in a group of temporary portacabins at the end of the pier next to the dinghy dock.<span> Visit Immigration first where you pay for your vessel and number of passengers. Next office is The Ministry of Tourism where you buy your tourist cards. Then the Port Authority who just want vessel information. Finally the Department of Agriculture where there is a small fee to cover garbage disposal etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Obtaining an international zarpe here is reported to take some time, so visit the authorities 2 days before departure to ensure you get the zarpe the day you need it.</span></p>
<p>Ocean World Marina, just East of Luperon, is also an official port of entry.</p>
<p><i><strong>Important Note re. Clearance Charges in Luperon<br/></strong></i><i>Luperon has a long history of "made up charges". In the past cruisers have reported being charged </i><i>harbour entrance fees</i><i>, pet landing fees and a daily anchoring fee etc. These charges are all "made up" by the local officials. Read feedback from cruisers (in comments at bottom of page) before considering this port as an option.</i></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Puerto Blanco Yacht Club, Marina &amp; Restaurant is a gathering place for cruising sailors and various social activities are organised. It underwent a m<span>ajor renovation during the Autumn of 2014 and re-opened in December 2014 with a new owner Leonard Perdomo (Leo).</span></p>
<p><span></span>There is now also two new marinas, the refurbished one at the Luperon Yacht Club and another, Marina Tropical, further improving facilities here.</p>
<p>Papo (call on VHF channel 68) can help with moorings.</p>
<p>See <a href="Members/sue/R2008-05-20-2"><strong>Report on Luperon</strong></a>, for tips on anchoring. Be aware of the risk of entering Luperon bay at night due to numerous fishing nets located outside the channel.</p>
<p>Access to the harbour is shallow and the harbour water is foul. One should avoid swimming or using a watermaker here.</p>
<p><span>Non-potable water is available at the boatyard and the dinghy dock near the old yacht club. Potable water can be delivered to your boat (as can fuel).</span></p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>Cruisers have reported that it is wise to lock your dinghy at the public dinghy dock. Thefts were common here in the past, however, security has improved with the appointment of a new commandante and an armed patrol boat does operate at night now.</p>
<p>If leaving your boat here for any length of time it is recommended you appoint a caretaker. Only use caretakers recommended and used by other cruising boats.</p>
