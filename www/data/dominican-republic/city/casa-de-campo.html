<div class="hello"><div><p>This upmarket tourist resort is situated in La Romana, on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic, just over 2nm from Catalina Island.</p>
<p>The marina is located behind a long breakwater that begins on the west shore of the Chavon River and extends to a striped lighthouse marking the starboard entrance to the marina channel. This channel is also clearly marked by red and green buoys. If coming from the east, the marina is not behind Punta Minas, it is east of it.</p>
<p>Position 18° 23.47'N,  68° 54.15'W</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information and fees.</span></p>
<p>The marina can assist with all clearance arrangements. Once you have the marina in sight, call them on the VHF. They respond to Spanish, English, French and Italian.</p>
<p>They are very helpful and will assist with guidance to a berth, tying up and finding the correct officials to come to your boat.</p>
<p>See reports below by boats that have recently cleared in here with details of charges and slight problems that occurred - so you know what to watch out for. In particular, excessive berthing charges for being put on a private berth, fees for towing a dinghy and berthing assistance after hours.</p>
<p>Listed at the marina office:<br/><span>Berth assistance after hours: $74 per hour. <br/></span><span>Arriving and towing a dinghy: $74</span></p>
