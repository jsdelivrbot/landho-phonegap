<p><span>The Spanish spoken in Monte Cristi is closer to European Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 19° 53'02"N, 71° 37'45"W (anchorage)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not a port of entry, however officials here may be able to arrange for the necessary paperwork to be completed by bringing the officials from Manzanillo.</p>
<p>As well as the normal clearance fees (see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/DominicanRepublic?rc=Formalities">DR Formalities</a></b> for more details), you will also be expected to pay the transportation charge for the officials and a tip.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This area is beautiful and the anchorage is protected from everything except west winds, which are very rare. I<span>t is possible to anchor almost anywhere. </span></span></p>
<p><span>From the West side of the El Morro part of the anchorage, there is an entrance to the mangrove canal which has over 20’ of depth and leads directly to the Monte Cristi yacht club.  They have limited facilities but a slip will likely be available. </span></p>
<p><span>The anchorage in the bay of Monte Cristi is preferred however for ventilation. </span></p>
<p><span>Land your dinghy at the Yacht Club by going under the small bridge on the east side of El Morro which takes you directly to the Yacht Club.</span></p>
