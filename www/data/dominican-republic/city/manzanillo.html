<div class="hello"><div><p>The abandoned Canadian ferry is an unmissable landmark for this anchorage. Give the ferry a wide berth.</p>
<p>Avoid anchoring on the east side of the bay in the National Park as this would be seen as suspicious.  It is better to go to the Saltwater lagoon (Estero Balza) in the South West part of the bay, south of the commercial dock.</p>
<p>This is a quiet saltwater lagoon where you can anchor in about 3m. <span><span>The small village of Pepillo Salcedo is within walking distance of the anchorage. </span></span></p>
