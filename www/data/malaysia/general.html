<p>A prepaid SIM card for Malaysia is a practical option for using your existing world phone as a prepaid Malaysia cell phone with a better rate than you’d pay for a Malaysia cell phone rental. It’s also a trouble-free ticket to using the same options that the Malaysians themselves use—the local Malaysian cell phone system. The SIM chip, combined with an unlocked GSM World cell phone, helps you keep the lines of communication open without being burdened by high international roaming surcharges applicable when you use your “home” SIM card abroad with voicemail and FREE incoming calls.</p>
