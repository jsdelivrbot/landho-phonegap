<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>The Immigration and Quarantine offices are both located in the large ferry terminal building, near the main large green domed Mosque on the far side of town. (a 15 minure walk).</p>
<p>The Harbour Master (Jabatan Laut) and Customs offices are both in a waterfront building further north‐west of the ferry terminal, near the first set of traffic lights (10 minute walk). The Harbourmaster has an office on a corner nearly opposite the Customs building.</p>
<p>Immigration Office is further away (15 min walk)  All the officials are helpful and friendly. <span>Since the political problems in the Lahad Datu region in early 2013, there may be more security forces present in the town and Immigration may be more vigilant about foreign nationals entering or leaving the country here.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note the new update</span><span> to the restrictions on visas. See </span><strong><a href="../?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Malaysia/Immigration</a>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>An Indonesian Consulate is situated at Jl. Sin On, Mile 2,5 Tawau City and is very quick at processing Indonesian visas.  This is a taxi ride away from the town.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The main yacht anchorage is just to the west of the port jetty, outside the Tawau Yacht Club (04° 15.4' N,  117° 52.37' E).</p>
<p>This is generally suitable for short term stays.  The anchorage (in about 5m) is mainly sandy mud with an unfortunate layer of rubbish and plastic bags which may foul an anchor hence the emphasis on short stays if the yacht is unattended.  </p>
<p>The prevailing monsoon winds in August are from the SW and the long open fetch can cause anchors to drag.  Anchoring depths are about 5-8 m with a strong current generating wind against tide issues.</p>
<p>The Yacht Club is very friendly and has a long jetty, but beware of the tree stakes situated immediately in front of it. These are used as FADs - Fish Attracting Devices.  </p>
<p>Care should be taken to secure your dinghy with lock and key as dinghy and outboard thefts have been reported here.</p>
<p>The main town is a short walk along the ajoining main road to the right towards the port area.</p>
