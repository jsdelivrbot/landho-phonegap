<p>Information on clearance can be obtained from the yacht club. All officials are reported to be very friendly.</p>
<p>Harbourmaster (Jabatan Laut) is next to the Esso Service Station, one block back from the waterfront.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs are a taxi ride west of town at the international ferry terminal. Use this Immigration office rather than the one at the airport.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a pleasant, sheltered anchorage, although a little noisy from the number of water taxis. <span>There is an exclusion zone for anchoring off the town.</span></p>
<p>The yacht club is very welcoming, however reports from cruisers in 2014 are that prices have increased here substantially for docking and using just the dinghy dock. Advice is to go ashore first and enquire about pricing before using the facilities.</p>
<p>When anchoring, beware of some foul ground directly in front of the yacht club as there is a cable running out from the slipway next door. Another anchorage can be found <span>on the other side of the Exclusion Zone, just west of the Coastguard jettyand before the fishing fleet wharves. There is approx. 8 M depth here with good holding.</span></p>
<p><span> Dinghies can be parked at the Yacht Club if you pay for temporary membership (annual rate and reported to be high). </span></p>
<p><span>There have been a number of reports of outboards being stolen from yachts anchored here, even when the engines have been locked and chained in the cockpit. Incidents have been reported to the local police and some outboards recovered but visiting yachts should take care.</span></p>
