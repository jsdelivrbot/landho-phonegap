            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The small island of Labuan lies just 5nm off the northern coast of Sabah, on the  island of Borneo, about <span>20 miles West of Brunei</span>. The port of Bandar Labuan is on the southern side of the island.</p>
<p><span>This is a beautiful island with clear water, clean tree lined streets and white sandy beaches. It has duty-free status.</span></p>
<p>This is a large marine oil support depot, so almost all services, whilst hard to find, are available here. Cruisers have put together a useful list of services in Labuan for visiting yachts, dated March 2015. You can <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../../images/pdfs/malaysian-borneo-sabah-labuan-services_mar15/">download it here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There is a lot of history to explore in Labuan and the best place to hire a car is  at the ferry terminal. Half a day is plenty of time to go right around the island  and you will be given a very informative map.</p>
<p><span>After 2 years of extensive renovations the government-run Marina reopened in March 2014</span>. There are also several anchoring options here.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>On arrival report to Harbour Control on VHF 16/10.</p>
<p>As Labuan enjoys a certain degree of autonomy, it is necessary to clear  Immigration  on arrival, even if coming from Kota Kinabalu or another Malaysian  state. This is a good place to clear in or out of Malaysia as the officials here are used to yachts and the process is quite quickly completed.</p>
<p><span>Note the new update</span><span> to the restrictions on visas. See </span><strong><a href="../?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Malaysia/Immigration</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions for Clearing In<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Port Office</strong><br/> Leave the marina entrance and turn immediately left, past the Waterfront Hotel.  Walk along this road until you reach a large grassy field (Labuan Square), and  the road turns to the right. At the junction opposite the Police Station, turn  left along the main road, keeping the field on your left. Walk along this road  until you reach a roundabout. The Customs House will be seen just past the first  turning off the roundabout. It has a terrible paint scheme (pink, blue and  yellow) and cannot be missed! The Port offices are behind the Customs and to the  right. Pass through the security gate, enter the offices, and go to the first  floor.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong><br/> This is in the Ferry Terminal. Leave the Port Office, the reverse of the way you  came in, and turn left at the roundabout. You will pass two banks on your left  hand side. Keep walking until the ferry terminal buildings appear. Walk the full  length of the front of the terminal and turn left into the arrivals hall. There  will probably be nobody around (unless a ferry has recently arrived), so hang  around until someone turns up! The Immigration Official will take you to their  office, in the bowels of the terminal building, where formalities are carried  out.</p>
<p><strong>Customs</strong><br/> Retrace your footsteps to the Customs House, and enter the front door. The  security man will be behind his desk to your left, and will direct you to the  Customs Office, which is hidden behind the staircase.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing Out</strong><br/><span>When clearing out, visit Immigration then Customs, as well as the Port  Office.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring Options</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can anchor on the other side of the river from the ferry terminal off the  township outside the mosque. It does start to shallow off here so be aware of  the depths. Also the seabed is strewn with much litter so dig the anchor in  well. It is perhaps too shallow to go further up the river.</p>
<p>Anchoring directly off the marina wall is also possible in about 10 metres of  water, although the rebound of wash from ferries, fishing boats etc. makes for a  very bumpy anchorage.</p>
<p>To go ashore to the town you can hail a water taxi (VHF channel 67) or for short  visits you can tie you dinghy up at the ramp of the water taxi jetty. There are  two water taxi companies and the one that operates from near the ferry terminal  are reported to be the cheapest. If you find a driver you are happy with, ask  for his phone number so you can call him when you want to go ashore.</p>
<p><span>Boats at anchor are welcome to leave their dinghy at the marina when going ashore, and have access to the showers as well as get water and drop garbage. There is no fee for any of these services. With the limited access and a gate guard, it is more secure than the beach landing. There is also a small cafe on the premises.</span></p>
<p>If anchoring off the Sports Complex, there is a dinghy dock below the  restaurant. Water is available at the complex as well as garbage disposal. The  holding is good, but rather exposed in a squall.</p>
<p><span>It is possible to stay at Menumbok, or one of the smaller islands, and make a day‐trip into Labuan harbour to provision if you are reluctant to stay there overnight.</span></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br/> It is essential to lock your yacht and stow outboard engines and other easily  portable items below. Thefts of such items have been reported here in the past (June 2013).</p>

      This government run marina was closed for renovation for 2 years. Whilst the marina is no longer part of the Waterfront Hotel business, the hotel pool is still available to marina guests for a small daily fee. Facilities include toilets, showers, washing and drying machines, internet and WiFi. The staff are helpful and there is a small cafe on site.<br>
Surge was a problem in the past, however, a few hundred more metres of break water was included in the redevelopment to combat this problem.<br>
Yachts at anchor are welcome to leave their dinghy here, and have access to the showers as well as get water and drop garbage. No fee.
