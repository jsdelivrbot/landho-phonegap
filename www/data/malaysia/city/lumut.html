<div class="hello"><div><p>The Lumut International Yacht Club (LIYC) closed for business at the end of February 2016.  Yachts can still anchor off the marina (<span>Location 04 14.2'N, 100 38.4'E)</span>, however no facilities are available.</p>
<p>The Pangkor Marina near Lumut, which opened in 2011, is now the only option for marina berthing here. It comes highly recommended by cruisers and is a good place to get work done. Take care in the approach at low water. Space inside is tight, so be prepared.</p>
<p>There is a<span> night market just a short walk from the Marina on Friday nights. </span><span>Walk over the causeway from the marina's artificial island to the mainland, turn right and it's a 20 minute walk.</span></p>
<p>The moorings further up river previously run by Mr Chan and Mr Zainal (at  Kampung Baharu) no longer exist.</p>
