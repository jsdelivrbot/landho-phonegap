<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a long jetty off the beach at Kampung Penybong, about 5NM S of the Endau  river.</p>
<p>The small government run marina up stream, near the bridge, is no longer open to the public. The marina has <span>been taken over by the Malaysian Maritime, and now only permit government boats to moor. Security has been increased as the patrol boats carry arms.</span></p>
<p><span>There are hardware shops, and small supermarket in the town.</span></p>
<p>If anchoring at the mouth of the river at night, in order to wait for the tide, an  anchor watch is recommended as a yacht displaying the proper anchor lights was  rammed by a fishing boat here in September 2012, a hit and run.</p>
