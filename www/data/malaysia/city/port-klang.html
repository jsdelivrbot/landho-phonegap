<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Klang sits in a soup of sludge, sewage, debris and other detritus, stirred by fierce currents and the wash of a myriad of tramp steamers. It lies at the antithesis of the crystalline waters which await just around the corner of Peninsula Malaysia, however its one redeeming feature is the oasis of the Royal Selangor Yacht Club.</p>
<p>In 2016 l<span>ocal authorities in the State of Selangor installed barriers at strategic points on the river in an attempt to clean up the 110-km long Klang River. This has led to a marked difference in the condition of the water downstream of the last boom, in particular off the RSYC.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Proceed up the east channel to the mooring area of the Royal Selangor Yacht Club. Once can call up the yacht club who will send a pilot to guide you to a berth on a floating pontoon in the middle of the fast-flowing channel opposite the clubhouse. There is a regular launch service to the club, where the office will give a map showing the location of customs, immigration and harbour master's offices, all of which are in the nearby commercial port area.</p></div></div>

      This marina has over 100 berths with power and water(in need of repair). Toilets and laundry facilities are available in the main building. It is government operated and rates are reasonable. There is now a new manager (Amhad Samsuri) and money has been promised for necessary improvements.<br>
Due to trapped water in the pontoons, the mosquitos are bad.<br>
Note: Tidal flow is strong at springs but you can tie up on the outer pontoon in fast tidal conditions and move inside as the flow reduces.<br>
The marina is very isolated, 2.5 hrs in taxi from KL and 1 hr from Lotus/Carrefour/Giant supermarket. Cruisers have recommended Den (012 356 9017) as a driver, he speaks English.

<div class="hello"><div>The Royal Selangor Yacht Club (RSYC) may be used by visiting yachts and will normally advise where to find the necessary repair facilities. The club is reached by going up the east channel at Port Klang.<br>
The pontoons at RSYC have recently been extensively repaired and, if available, offer direct access to the yacht club with fuel, water, 24 hour security and 24 hour pontoon staff on duty. A safe place to leave your boat for any length of time.<br>
There are also club moorings which should be used in preference to anchoring as currents are very strong in the river (up to 5kn). There is a launch service to the club. Yachts can come alongside the club's floating pontoon to fuel and take on water for up to 2 hours (longer stays must be arranged in advance) provided they are not left unattended.<br>
