<div class="hello"><div><p><span>All yachts can access Johor Bahru on the east side of the causeway. This is where the new <strong>Senibong Cove Marina</strong> is located, newly opened in June 2014 with 50 berths.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../SebanaCove">Sebana Cove </a></strong>is also an "east side" stop.  The concern here is depth not height restrictions.  Most yachts will need at least a half tide to proceed comfortably up the river.</span></p>
<p>Accessing Johor Bahru and the marinas on the west side of the causeway is only possible by yachts whose height of mast is less than 25 meters from waterline. Sail 13 miles up the western arm of Jahor Straits, past Raffles Marina and under the centre span of the Tuas Bridge, (the "Second-Link" bridge), which has a minimum vertical clearance of 25 meters at HWS. Proceed upstream, staying away from the Singapore coast and keeping close to the Malaysian mainland all the way.</p>
<p>The site of the original Danga Bay marina has now been filled in and the<span> area  absorbed into the huge residential development that has been taking place in the area for the last 2 years.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>All yachts requiring clearance here <strong>must</strong> ensure they fly the <code>Q</code> flag, otherwise they may be fined.</p>
<p>Yachts coming from Sebana and other ports in Malaysia also have to do  harbour clearance here.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Puteri Harbour Marina and</strong><strong><b> </b></strong><b>Senibong Cove Marina</b> can assist with clearance if you don't want to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Take a taxi into Johor Bahru to the Harbour Master (Jabatan Laut) on the waterfront to the West of the causeway near Danga Bay. They close for lunch until 2pm, but processing is quick. Immigration are on the second floor of The Zon ferry terminal on the East side of the causeway.</p>
<p>Customs are also located at The Zon ferry terminal, but they only want to see vessels for outward clearance and issue of Port Clearance after clearing out with the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>Alternatively, yachts may prefer to first stop at Pengileh to clear in before proceeding to the marina. Pengileh does have a marina, but it's not suitable for a cruising yacht.  Anchoring just outside is tenable, and all the officials are in the same building so clearance is quick and efficient. You then proceed around the east/northeast side of Singapore to Senibong or the anchorage east of the causeway. You will see Singaporean police boats monitoring the border pretty consistently along this 20NM stretch.</p>
<p>Immigration outward clearance is not required if stopping at further Malaysian ports on the Penninsula. <span>Clearance is required if heading to Sarawak or Sabah on Borneo. </span></p>
<p><span>Many nationalities will receive a new entry stamp, which is good for a three months stay in Malaysia, each time they return across the causeway from Singapore or on arrival. However, it's best to do </span><span>up-to-date research on your own situation first, as the list of permitted nationalities is ever-changing.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/><span>You can easily anchor just east of the Causeway, between the new waterfront KFC and duty-free "The Zon."  Holding is reported to be good and it is convenient for shopping. </span></p>
<p><span>There is a boat ramp and small, popular public beach where you can land your dinghy. It is not possible to park your tender at the marina police dock. </span><span>Do be very wary of leaving your dinghy on the beach however, as dinghy and outboard theft is common. It is recommended so always be in sight of the dinghy.</span></p>
<p>Yachts used to be able to anchor in 4.0 to 7.0 meters with excellent holding in mud/clay at Lat 01.28.47N and Long.103.43.37E just off Danga Bay Marina for free. However, with the closure of this marina it is unlikely this anchorage is still available.</p>

<p><strong>Puteri Harbour Marina </strong>is situated 30 minutes away from Johor Bahru on the west side of the causeway. It is rather isolated as it is stuck <span>in the outer reaches of Nusajaya, a planned city that’s under construction and mostly uninhabited. There a hotel complex that backs on to the marina, a shopping mall with <span>a pharmacy, ATM and newsagent but no grocery store yet. There is also a bank and post office in the fancy government buildings near the marina</span>. <span>This marina is also <span>situated across the river from a Singaporean military zone so be aware that gun fire will be heard from time to time. <i>Photo of Puteri Harbour Marina courtesy of <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com.es/2013/10/vignettes-on-way-up-malay-peninsula.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+S/vTotemFamily+(S/V+Totem+Family)">SY Totem</a></strong>.</i></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Senibong Cove Marina, </strong><span>new in 2014, is situated 15 minutes by car from Johor Bahru on the east side of the causeway. Cruisers reports are very positive about this marina and its management.</span></p>
<p><span><span><i>Photo Senibong Cove Marina : © SY Yindee Plus</i></span></span></p>
<p>It is possible to make a day visit to Singapore from Senibong Cove marina. It takes between 2 to 3 hours each way. See <a href="../day-trips-to-singapore-from-senibong-cove-marina-malaysia/"><strong>this report</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p><span><strong>Crime</strong></span></p>
<p>Penang and JB are reported to be the worst areas for crime in Malaysia. Take necessary precautions when going ashore and if cycling, be sure to cover baskets/crates to avoid bags being snatched.</p>
