<div class="hello"><div><p>Langkawi is a large island off the west coast close to the border with Thailand. The island is<span> duty-free.</span></p>
<p>With anchorages surrounded by wooded cliffs fringed at their base by mangrove swamps, and a labyrinth of narrow channels which weave through their density accessible by dinghy, this place is a firm favourite with cruisers.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Marinas</strong><br/> There are marinas at the Royal Langkawi Yacht Club, Telaga Harbour and Rebak marina on the small island of Rebak. Rebak Marina has been expanded and now has some repair facilities as well as a drydock, however check before going that they can provide the service you are looking for. It is a safe place to leave the boat while touring the interior and is a particular favourite with long-term live-aboards. The RLYC was redeveloped during 2015 and now has retail outlets, restaurants and more berths.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong><br/> There are several safe and secure moorings available; Bass Harbour Moorings (in front of Kuah Town), "Hole In The Wall" Moorings (NE coast of Langkawi island) and Telaga Harbour Moorings.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> Spectacular anchorages abound in this area, but for long-term stays the best year-round choice is in Bass Harbour, close to Kuah. Bass Harbour has two main anchorage areas; just west of the Royal Langkawi Yacht Club (RLYC) or in front of the Bella Vista Hotel. The holding is not good and it is advisable to have someone on board at all times. Yachts dragging during squalls is especially a  problem. Marine growth is also a problem, but the main disadvantages of both is the difficult dinghy landing.</p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock which has a weekly charge, in front of the Mosque, for use by yachts at anchor. A tripper boat dock may reduce the size of the anchorage.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Dinghies left in places with security, such as Jeti Pelancongan or RYLC, can be considered safe for temporary periods while ashore in daylight hours. However, as is the general rule anywhere in the cruising world, if left in remote places or with no security they are at risk and liable for theft. This also applies, while in any anchorage, for dinghies that are NOT in davits, or on deck, or not secured with heavy stainless cable and locks if they are left in the water overnight.</p>

      This marina is part of a five star resort so expect to pay a bit more, however fees are still cheap by western standards.  Berth holders get a 35% discount on everything at the resort.  It is well sheltered on its own island, connected by 15-minute ferry to the main island of Langkawi. Minimum depth 2.5 metres. <br>
Whilst resort facilities are 5 star, the marina facilities are poorly maintained. Showers &amp; toilets, restaurant, swimming pool, laundry, LPG, limited WiFi, accommodation.<br>
Boatyard with 65 ton travel lift, shore storage and some repair services. Often has special offers for haulout etc.
