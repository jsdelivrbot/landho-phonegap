<div class="hello"><div><p>A popular holiday destination on the west coast, Port Dickson is about 60 NM north of Melaka. It is famous for its beaches. <span>This is a great place to stop while sailing the Malacca Straits and a convenient base to tour the wonderful city of Melaka.</span></p></div></div>

<p><span>Unfortunately the marina no longer has immigration and customs offices as it is now a requirement for all visitors to Malaysia to be fingerprinted. Visiting cruisers now need to take a taxi (or bus - runs every hour) into Port Dickson for clearance with Immigration, the Harbour Master and Customs. Cruisers report that the process is quick and straightforward and there are no fees. </span></p>
<p><span>The Marina is hoping to offer a service in the future to escort skippers to the official offices in Port Dickson.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina here is well sheltered from all weathers but the entrance is tricky to get into as the bay has a sand bank in the middle. To enter come in at right angles from the deep water channel (02º 28' 36N, 101º 49' 86E) to the end of the breakwater.</p>
<p>The marina should be contacted on VHF Ch14 before entry. If arriving after hours, berth at the fuel pontoon (pumps not working). Staff are reported to be friendly and professional.</p>
