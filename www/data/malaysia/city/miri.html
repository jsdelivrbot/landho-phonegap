<div class="hello"><div><p>Miri is a booming oil and timber town and the gateway to the Northeast region, rapidly becoming Sarawak's most popular tourist area.  It is within easy reach of some national parks, large rivers, heritage and adventure travel destinations and some of the best scuba diving in Borneo.</p>
<p>Miri Marina is a well kept secret and a good<span> place to leave your boat if you plan on visiting </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>Gunung</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>Mulu</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>National Park</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>. This national park is a must-see for visitors to Malaysian Borneo.

Gunung Mulu is a short and inexpensive plane ride from Miri airport which is only 15-20 minutes from the marina.</span></p>
<p>Like anywhere, if leaving your boat here, remove any portable items from the decks before you leave.</p>
<p>As Miri is a centre for the off-shore industry of Northern Sarawak, one can find anything and everything here and the costs of marine supplies and hardware etc. are reported to be very reasonable.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina, although sited in a rather bleak area, is a convenient berth and in a well sheltered lagoon. It is situated south of the main port of Miri. The entrance is easily identified by the huge statue of a Sea Horse (the emblem of Miri) on the port hand side, with a large Chinese Sea Food restaurant close by. There is a low, rocky, breakwater on the starboard side, and it is recommended to favour this side on entry.</p>
<p><span>Be aware that there can be breaking waves outside the marina entrance if a large swell is running.</span></p>
<p>A night entrance is not recommended.</p>
<p>Access into the town is easy by taxi, bike or bus. It is approx. a 45 min. walk.</p>
<p>Beware of the marina´s resident crocodile when carrying out underwater jobs.</p>
