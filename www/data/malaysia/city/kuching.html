<div class="hello"><div><p>Kuching is the capital of Sarawak. The town itself is worth visiting for the old buildings, and museums.</p>
<p>Two bridges makes it difficult for most yachts to get up the river to Kuching itself. One has a reported height of 17m+ at low water and the other (at position 01°33.3'.2N, 110°22.42'E ) has a reported clearance of 12m. </p>
<p>Position 01° 33.5' N, 110° 24.3' E (marina).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see <b><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p>Clearance can be made in Pending, a few miles down river from Kuching.</p>
<p>Clearance is required at the Harbour Master, Customs, Immigration - in that order.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note the new update</span> to the restrictions on visas. See <a href="../?rc=Formalities#Immigration"><strong>Malaysia/Immigration</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Harbour Master</strong><br/> The Harbour Master’s Office is now at the marina, next to the Borneo Convention Centre, Kuching. It<span> is a very long walk back to Pending Port to complete formalities with Immigration and Customs from here.</span></p>
<p>Explain to the Harbour Master that you wish to obtain port clearance for a SMALL (i.e. not a commercial vessel) yacht, (kapal layar). You should be given "Form Marina 28 MSS 1" (Merchant Shipping Ordinance - 1960, Arrival Form). Most of the form is irrelevant, so fill out what you think applies, but check with the officer that all that is required is submitted, or struck out. Take your copy for submission to Customs.</p>
<p>Check out is the same but uses "Form Marina 28 MSS 2" (Departure Form). It is possible that you can complete both forms at the same time, which saves another journey back to the office.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong><br/> The Immigration Office is located inside Pending Port and can be clearly seen through the fence. Making your way round the perimeter fence, enter the Main Port Entrance (about 1 km). Drive straight to the first roundabout and turn left (passing the garage for all the fork lift trucks etc.), drive straight on until you reach the perimeter fence, then turn right, following the fence until you see the building.  Immigration is on the right hand side of this building, and is clearly marked.</p>
<p><strong>Customs</strong><br/> The Customs Office is located on the concrete platform at the Security Check Point as you enter the Port. Port Security may stop you and check the vehicle. Climb onto the end of the platform; Customs is the first door into a very small office. Note: they have no photocopier here.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A new government marina opened here January 2010, 7 miles up the Sarawak River not far from the Pending old port. It provides a convenient stop within easy reach of Kuching by local bus. The facilities are reported to be of a good standard (see details below).</p>
<p>The only authorized anchorage area is now just outside of the village of Sajingkat, 01°35'17"N, 110°26'59"E (clearly marked at the riverside). Use VHF channel 20 to contact the river authority (signal). The village will watch over the dinghy (although they expect to be paid). From here it is a short walk down the road to the bus stop for Kuching, where a taxi may also be flagged down.</p>
<p>The anchorage near to the causeway is currently being dredged, and is reportedly unsecure. Several boats have been broken into and the Marine Police advise not leaving the boat unattended even during the day - one should check the latest situation on arrival.</p>
<p>Also, beware of the large logs being swept down the river.</p>
<p>An overnight stay can be made at Muara Tebas on the way in, but one should watch out for the strong current and the long scope on the local fishing boats. There are a couple of good seafood restaurants here, and it is worth walking to the top of the temple for a good view of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The other anchorage to consider is around the corner from Kuching in Santubong. This is entered over a very shallow bay and up the river mouth and care must be taken upon entry. However once in the river the depth is fine and there is good holding. There is a bus into Kuching from the main road and the dinghy can be left at the landing at Santubong, again security is a question. See<b> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Malaysia/Santubong">Malaysia/Santubong</a></b></p>
<p>If you wish to visit the Sarawak Cultural Village from here it is a good long hot walk there and back as no buses run from here. E-mail <a href="mailto:scv@visitsarawak.com"><b>scv@visitsarawak.com</b></a>.</p>

      Kuching Marina is 7 miles up the Sarawak River and is a blue-roofed building next to the Borneo Convention Centre (BCCK, a big green color complex), not far from the Pending Old Port. This is a small government run marina for 20+ yachts. Water, electricity and showers. Security guard at entrance, but access from the river is very easy so keep boat locked at all times. Office has still to be built, but facilities good. Location is quiet and remote. Beware of logs and other debris washing through the marina and the tide when berthing.<br>
See reports about this marina from cruisers adjacent.

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Sarawak Boat Club (SBC) is just about 5 Km up the Santubong River, just under the Santubong Bridge. Sarawak Boat Club is not open to the public, however yachts may still use the facilities with miminium payment. Diesel can be bought from the Club Operator and there is a simple restaurant with very good seafood. The SBC will soon have a new site at the Santubong river mouth (Kuala Santubong) with a bigger marina facility. </p>
