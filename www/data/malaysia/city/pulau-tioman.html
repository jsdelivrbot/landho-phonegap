<div class="hello"><div><p>Located 35 NM off the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula, Tioman Island has been voted one of the world's most beautiful islands. Scenic, tranquil, with miles of white sandy beaches and crystal clear waters teeming with spectacular marine life and colourful coral gardens. The twin peaks of Gunung Nenek Semukut provide a prominent landmark to this island.</p>
<p>This is still very much the case today and cruising yacht SV Totem reported in September 2013 "<span>What a pleasant surprise to find that Tioman is still a sleepy place of quiet beauty. Yes, it got busy on the weekend with the flocks from Singapore and KL, but most of the time it was just heavenly peace".</span></p></div></div>

<p>The Marine Park Authority has laid orange buoys all round the island.</p>
<p>Most of the villages have jetties.</p>
<p><b>Juara Beach</b> is a fair-weather anchorage on the eastern side of the island with exposure to the E. It is a surf beach in the NE monsoon routinely exposed. All sand, no reef, with good holding in ~20' close in. <span>Juara has a collection of small beach-front restaurants, with </span><span>generally lower prices than in Tektek. Laundry services also available </span><span>for less than Tektek. There's minimal provisioning available here.</span></p>
