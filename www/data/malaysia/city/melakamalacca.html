<div class="hello"><div><p>The quiet, seaside city of Malaka (Malacca) lies about 150km south of Kuala Lumpur. In its heyday, 500 years ago, it was a major port along the spice-route, and its harbour was thick with the sails and masts of vessels from all over the world. Because the city was originally built of wood, there are no ancient reminders of those times, but along shores of the Malacca River the scene has probably changed little and there are still many reminders of the colonial period of its history.</p>
<p>On the north bank of the river is "The Eye on Malaysia" (a large Ferris wheel) which is a good landfall mark when making for Malacca .</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A new 40 berth marina opened in Malacca in 2009 <span>on the north bank of the river by the "Eye on Malaysia".</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately it has been reported that this facility has now fallen into disrepair and is no longer suitable for cruising yachts. There were problems in the past with siltation, and it appears this has now rendered it unusable except for the smallest of sailing boats.</span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring behind the marina is possible in cases of emergency, however take care with depth (1.2m at low tide). </span></p>
