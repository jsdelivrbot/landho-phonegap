<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>There is only one walk-on marina (Sutera Harbour Marina) and various public anchorages where one can moor the boat before proceeding into town to visit the various offices.</p>
<p>If staying at Sutera Harbour Marina, t<span>he Marina Office are now able to undertake CIQP clearance on behalf of yacht owners/captains.</span></p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong><br/>Must be visited first. Office on the waterfront, north, in town, on Jalan Pantai. It is located in a small building behind the main building.</p>
<p><strong>Customs </strong><br/>At the Cargo Terminal at Jalan Tanjung Lipat. It is a small security/gate building where the guard has been replaced by the officer dealing with clearance. It is on the right of the main Custom Office when facing the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Jabatan Laut </strong><br/>Located at Sepanggar, approx. 25 kms north of town, past 1Borneo. This is difficult to get to unless you take a taxi, which will be expensive (about 100RM return – ask the taxi to wait for you!).</p>
<p>There are no charges at any of these Departments although 2-3 RM for the price of the form may be requested.</p>
<p>Checking out (if you are leaving the state of Sabah) is the same but in reverse order. Sailing within the state of Sabah only requires a simple port clearance from the Jabatan Laut. Nothing from Customs or Immigration.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is possible to anchor in the harbour and Harbour Control will tell you of any restricted areas. It is also possible to anchor in front of the city (05°58.738'N, 116°04.128'E), but be very careful with your dinghy and don't leave any valuables on deck.</p>
<p>Other options are to anchor/moor off the Kota Kinabalu Yacht Club, at Tanjung Aru, or outside Sutera Harbour Marina, 3 km from Kota Kinabalu. <span>Note that yachts anchored outside Sutera Harbour Marina are no longer able to </span><span>access the marina with their tenders, as berths are reserved for visiting yachts only.</span></p>
<p>There have been reports of thefts of dinghies and outboard motors from yachts at the <strong>Shangra-La anchorage/mooring</strong> area in the past. However latest reports are that it is safe and offers good holding. Sadly though, whilst t<span>h</span><span>ey now have a small jetty for their fleet of island hopping boats, this is no longer available as a dinghy dock and it seems visiting cruisers are no longer welcome at the resort.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Noonsite has been advised that yachts are no longer welcomed by the management of the Gaya Island Resort. </span><span>Nevertheless, there are some beautiful anchorages around Pulau Gaya on both the NE and SW sides.</span></span></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="../../malaysia-pics/malaysia-borneo_sutera-harbour_sv-ariel-1/@@images/image/mini"/>Thefts have also been reported in the past at the <strong>Sutera Harbour Marina</strong> from yachts on the (overflow) Southern pontoon, however additional security and CCTV are now in place<i> (photo courtesy of SV Ariel)</i>. The marina is usually full with only a few berths available for visitors on a first come, first served basis. Making a reservation is advisable.</p>

Popular 100+ berth marina including 8 berths for superyachts up to 200ft. The clubhouse is attached to two 5-star hotels and a 27-hole championship golf course, the facilities of which are available to berth holders (pools, restaurants, gym, bowling, billiards, tennis, squash and badminton courts). Yachts with live-in crew <b>must</b> have holding tanks. The marina is well-protected.<br>

<b>Advice to intending visiting yachts.</b> Sutera Harbour Marina, though primarily a members-only marina, does usually have available spaces for visitors. Call in advance for availability and to make a reservation. Since early 2014 the whole resort has been under new management and prices have risen. There is a min. charge for 30ft on wet berths and yachts mooring on longer pontoons are charged by berth length. Multihulls pay fees x 1.5 and a security deposit is required by all berth holders. For the latest fee structure and regs. see the marina website.

      The Shangri-La hotel at Tanjung Aru has an anchorage area, however no landing facilities or hotel facilities are available as these are exclusively for the use of Shangri-La guests only (Oct. 2013). Care and a good chart is needed for getting into the anchorage area. You can walk to the Golf Club, Yacht Club or the hawker stalls that are past the hotel for meals. The local bus into Kota Kinabalu stops at the hotel staff entrance. There are also plenty of taxis from the hotel car park.

      It is a short walk from the Shangri-La Hotel along the beach or road to the Yacht Club. There is an anchorage off the beach but in SW winds this could be untenable, you have to leave your dinghy on the beach but there is usually someone at the yacht club who may keep an eye on it. The buses pass right outside the gate.

The Yacht Club asks that you pay 25rm a week membership but it is well worth this to take advantage of the cheap good food and drinks that they serve in air-conditioned surroundings. The use of the pool is included, the showers are also very good, and they can arrange laundry for you.
Water is available but it is not potable. 
Cruisers recommend this as the best anchorage in Kota Kinabalu during the NE Monsoon.
