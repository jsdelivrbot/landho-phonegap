<div class="hello"><div><p>Terengganu is an interesting old port with a colourful history as a trading centre, and now a base for vessels serving Malaysia’s offshore oil and gas fields. It is the centre for Malay culture and heritage. <span>This is an excellent base for exploring the offshore islands.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearance into and out of Malaysia see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Malaysia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>Clearance is straightforward but does now require a taxi out to the airport.</p>
<p><span>The Customs and Harbour Master are near the Sri Malaysia Hotel.</span></p>
<p>The Immigration department in town will not now stamp passports and so a visit to Immigration based at the airport is required. The airport is 10 km from town and it is a 60 RM round trip taxi ride.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The newly dredged channel to Kuala Terengganu makes the approach straightforward although entry and exit can be difficult in the strong (3kn) currents.</p>
<p>There is a marina here on an island which provides a shuttle service to the main town on the other side of the river. <span>It is also an easy dinghy trip across to the town with a good floating dinghy dock next to the main wet market. </span>There is a <span>very helpful lady called Tinny based in the marina who can do minor sail repairs and speaks excellent English (unlike the very helpful marina staff).</span></p>
<p>There are <span>2 large new breakwaters not shown on the charts and </span>plenty of space to anchor inside the breakwater and two or three sets of steps at which to land.</p>
