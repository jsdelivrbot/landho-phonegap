<div class="hello"><div><p>Sebana Cove Marina is situated 5 miles up the Santi River, entrance off the eastern tip of Singapore Island. The initial approach from the Johor Strait should be carefully planned by skippers of deep draft vessels, as depths can drop to 2m in places.</p>
<p>Sebana Cove is a beautiful and remote location, and the marina and resort here are slowly being renovated (see latest comments from cruisers at bottom of page).</p>
<p><span> There is no ATM or shop here and the local town, a taxi / shuttle away, only has limited provisions. If you have already provisioned the boat and are looking for somewhere to relax, it's a good choice.</span></p>
<p>Position 01° 25'N, 104° 09'39"E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../malaysia-pics/malaysia_sebana-cove-marina"/>There is a good, sheltered anchorage at the mouth of the Santi river and another close to the marina, but keep clear of the sandy bay <span>dug into the bank of the river on the same side as the resort. Do not anchor in front of this as a small working ship comes there every day to load up</span>.</p>
<p><span>Whilst isolated and lacking in facilities, this is a quiet and peaceful place but not the most convenient for repairs or provisions.</span></p>
<p>The surrounding resort and shoreside facilities have recently been improved and updated, however the marina itself remains "tired" <i>(see photo courtesy of SY Yindee Plus December 2014)</i>. Wooden pontoons, whilst stable, are slowly decaying and there are no lights at night so due care should be taken. Apparently pontoon repair/replacement is planned.</p>

      Update Dec. 2014: Marina docking still to be renovated, however marina is open with electricity &amp; water. Take care at night as pontoons not lit. Ashore there are new showers, toilets, sauna, gym. Renovated main pool. Cafe and Bar for yachties. Resort very smart.
