<div><p>Yachts are only allowed to enter at one of the official ports of entry.</p>
<p>It is important to fly the <code>Q</code> flag on arrival.</p>
<p><strong><i>It is now a requirement for all visitors to Malaysia to be fingerprinted.</i></strong> This may mean that marinas which previously handled all formalities, can no longer do so, and a visit to the official offices is required.</p>
<p>Clear in with the Jabatan Laut (Marine Department, also called Harbour Master's department) with the ship's papers, Immigration (crew list and passports), Customs (list of ship's stores and last port clearance) and Health (crew list, animals and health certificates). The Health department may also require a de-ratting certificate or a de-ratting exemption certificate.</p>
<p><span>When clearing out, all the above offices must be visited and a port clearance must be obtained from Customs.</span></p>
<p>Yachts are only allowed to leave Malaysia from official ports of entry, but if one wants to sail on to a place, which does not have facilities for clearance, permission may be obtained when the port clearance is requested.</p>
<p>If leaving (or arriving from) one Malaysia state to another (Sabah, Sarawak or the Malay peninsula) ensure to both clear in and out.</p>
<p><strong>Sabah: </strong>Yachts need to have a port clearance document when leaving a port in Sabah (either for a local or an international destination). In the case of an accident/incident, it will be requested.</p>
<p>If clearing out of Malaysia to proceed to Thailand, ensure that crew who are planning to leave your boat there are noted as "passengers". This will avoid them having to place a bond which can be difficult to recover.</p>

<div><p>All visitors must have a passport valid for at least six months.</p>
<p>A visitor's pass may be issued on arrival at the port of entry. Its period of validity is at the discretion of the local Immigration officer and will depend on nationality, but is unlikely to be longer than 3 months. The list of nationalities that receive a 90 day visa on arrival is ever-changing. <span>See the</span><strong> <a href="http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/requirement-for-foreigner">Mayaysian Governnent  website</a></strong><span> for a useful table detailing the latest information, including which nationalities require a visa in advance.</span></p>
<p>Citizens of Israel have to apply for special pemission.</p>
<p>Extensions are difficult to obtain. In principle, yachts may remain indefinitely, but this depends on getting extensions of the visitor's pass. It is advisable to apply for a 2 year visa if wishing to leave your boat in the country.</p>
<p>All visitors must possess adequate funds for their stay.</p>
<p><strong>Sabah and Sarawak:</strong> When travelling between the Malay peninsula, Sabah and Sarawak the procedures are as if entering and leaving a different country. Immigration <strong>must</strong> be visited.</p>
<p><strong>Update Note</strong>: It is no longer the case that a new 90 day visitor's visa will be automatically issued on arrival in Sarawak or Sabah. Most visitors will only be granted the time remaining on the original Malaysian visa (Nationals from Commonwealth countries may be granted an extension). It is necessary to have your original visa cancelled or to the ensure you have enough time remaining on your visa before leaving Malaysia. It is also possible make a quick visit to either Singapore or Thailand to obtain another 3 month visa.</p>

<div><p>The Malaysian authorities make it very clear that trafficking in illegal drugs carries the death penalty, and that this applies also to foreign nationals. This death penalty has been carried out.</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared and then sealed by the Customs officer. A permit for firearms is required.</p>
<p>All medications or health supplements must be in the original packaging. Visitors requiring an unusual medicine, or requiring the use of scheduled drugs, such as morphine tablets or the use of syringes, should carry a letter from the prescribing doctor.</p>
<p>Many other items are absolutely prohibited:-</p>
<p>Any item from Israel.<br/> Fruits from The Philippines and Indonesia, turtle eggs, daggers and flick knives, articles resembling syringes and poisonous chemicals. Any literature on communism.<br/> It is advisable to check with the Customs Office on arrival if in doubt about any item.</p>
<p>Private yachts are permitted to stay indefinitely in Malaysia.</p>
<p><span>An important note on importing spare parts into Malaysia generally. Yacht spares are duty free if for a yacht in transit. The official government document says:<br/></span><span>"Spares for ships in transit must carry harmonized tariff code 9800.00.700 </span><span><span>and with this is tax free. Applies only to goods intended for incorporation in ships or vessels for the purpose of their construction, repair, maintenance or for fitting out or equipping such vessels. The spares imported are to be solely used by such vessels of an international nature departing to a destination outside the country."</span></span></p>
<p><span>DHL are reported to be better than Fedex at achieving duty free import. Don't forget to include the harmonization code. Once the package arrives in Malaysia you will have to contact the local DHL office with your ship registration and captain's passport before they can get customs to release the goods. </span></p>
