<div><ul>
<li>Port Sudan, the country's main port, is a convenient stop for yachts sailing up or down the Red Sea, although its facilities are poor and nothing has been done to improve them.</li>
<li>Boats coming from the south might find simpler formalities in Suakin, just south of Port Sudan.</li>
<li>Port Sudan's position at the halfway point of the Red Sea marks the point where the winds change from prevailing southerlies to northerlies. Northbound yachts face an uphill beat all the way to the Suez Canal, while southbound boats usually have to fight contrary winds as far as Bab el Mandeb and even beyond.</li>
<li>If not in a great hurry, the best tactic for northbound boats is to cover as much ground as possible inside the reefs, which extend parallel to the shore along most of Sudan's coastline. The reef anchorages offer perfect shelter and also great diving and fishing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Note that a Sudan cruising permit is required for passage through the reefs (obtainable in Port Suakin). If you don't have a Sudan cruising permit, try to stay outside the reefs especially near the Egyptian border, to avoid problems with the military.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yachts have been allowed to anchor along the coast before clearing in, provided no one goes ashore.</li>
<li>Many countries have an embargo against Sudan which could make it difficult to get spare parts shipped to you there. Be aware also that accessing bank accounts via the internet in Sudan <strong>may</strong> result in the account being frozen. </li>

<div><p>Cruisers should be aware that foreigners travelling inland are at risk from terrorist attacks and kidnapping. It is advisable to check with a website such as <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html">US Travel Warnings</a></p>
<p><span>Hostilities between Sudanese forces and armed opposition groups in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states, including the disputed area of Abyei, present real and immediate dangers to travelers.</span></p></div>
