<div class="hello"><div><p>This is Sudan's principal port and was built in 1905 on the grid system.  Although some streets have names, many do not. As the names are only in Arabic and as local taxi drivers are often illiterate, or do not speak any foreign language, the services of a local agent are indispensible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whenever dealing with one of the government departments, it is expected an agent to be used and the authorities simply refuse to deal with visitors direct.</p>
<p>Port Sudan is a commercial port and as such has no facilities for pleasure yachts.</p>
<p>Position 19° 36.6'N,37° 13.3'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Call port control on Channel 16 or 14 before entering the port.</p>
<p><span>There is an anchorage dedicated to small crafts/yachts on the South side once you have entered the inner port - just opposite the container harbour.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Clearance on entry has to be done with an appointed local agent. It's likely several will make contact with you after you have dropped anchor, each with different fees (EUR 50 - 80). The agent will organise all the appropriate authorities coming to the boat.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The formalities include quarantine (EUR 20), shore pass (no charge), entry visa (EUR 15/person), port dues (EUR 8/day), customs (EUR 25). </span></span><span>Everyone should remain on board until clearance is complete.</span></p>
<p>Customs and port police will seal all alcoholic drinks and radio equipment on board. The agent will then arrange shore passes, for which a passport size photograph is required. The passports must then be left with Immigration, which usually holds them until the following day. The ship's papers are held by the Port Office until port dues are paid, in US dollars cash, on departure.</p>
<p>On departure, one must clear with the port office, then pay the port dues at the Port Corporation in East Town. Next one has to clear customs, and return to the port office to get back the ship's papers.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage dedicated to small crafts/yachts on the South side once you have entered the inner port - just opposite the container harbour<span> </span><span>(19°36,6N 037°14,4E)</span><span>. Take a stern line to the shore. The anchorage is safe, the bottom has good holding, however it can get windy mainly from the port side so use enough ropes to be tight ashore.</span></p>
<p>It is possible to stay in Port Sudan for one night for free as long as you do not get off the boat, otherwise you have to clear in again using an agent.</p>
<p>Facilities for yachts are virtually non existent. There are security guards on shore permanently and shore passes are inspected.</p>
<p>Reasonable provisions are available walking distance from the port. <span>Money changers´ exchange differs by 10% from the bank rate, also they are open on holidays unlike the banks.</span></p>
