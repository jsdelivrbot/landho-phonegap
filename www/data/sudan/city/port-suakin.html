<div class="hello"><div><p>Although now in ruins, this ancient port was an important trading centre for 3,000 years. It was built with coral which required constant maintenance and once trade moved to the more modern port of Sudan, it quickly fell into disrepair.</p>
<p>It is located about 30nm south of Port Sudan.</p>
<p>This is a good first landfall after crossing of the Gulf of Aden as it is not necessary to clear into Sudan to visit here, and refuelling and provisioning here is easy.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Although Suakin is not an official port of entry, boats arriving here from the south have been allowed to clear into Sudan and formalities are reported to be simpler than at Port Sudan.</p>
<p>On approach, be sure to call Port Control on Channel 14.</p>
<p>Local agent Mohammed (phone: <span>+249 912 142 678)</span> will know of your arrival and will <span>be waiting for you on the south side of the Old Town island inside the harbour. He will </span>attract your attention and you will need to collect him in your dinghy.</p>
<p>He will then accompany you to authorities to help with formalities (he charges about US$40 for his services, less than Port Sudan).</p>
<p>Mohammed can also help obtain fuel and sweet water (by jerry can), laundry, gas refills, fresh produce, as well as trips to Port Sudan.</p>
<p>You need a passport photo each for shore passes. Costs are about $100 US to clear/port charges. Mohammed will do all the paper work and bring back shore passes the same day or next morning, depending on time you cleared in. Nothing extra for anchoring.</p>
<p>Shore passes will be issued for a short duration only. Formalities must be gone through again if continuing to Port Sudan. Formalities are simpler if one arrives with a Sudanese visa. Passports are retained until clearing out.</p>
<p>When clearing out from Suakin one can obtain a cruising permit which permits cruising up the coast to Port Sudan through the Sudan reefs. This is recommended to avoid any problems (see comment at bottom of page). Using Mohammed, clearing out is simple, fast and efficient.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach to the inner harbour is shallow but easy if you can avoid being distracted by the fascinating surroundings.</p>
<p>Very good all-round shelter.</p>
