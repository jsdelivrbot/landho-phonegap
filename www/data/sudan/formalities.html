<div><p>Travel permits are necessary when travelling anywhere in Sudan. These are obtained from the Foreigners Registration Office.</p>
<p>The country south of Kosti is closed, due to the activities of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement. The border with Ethiopia is closed. Travel anywhere in Sudan, including Khartoum and the adjacent town of Omdurman, is potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>A photography permit is required, and can be obtained from the tourist office.</p>
<p>Be careful where you point your camera and do not photograph any official building, especially if it is military. So any building flying a Sudanese flag or its environs are out of bounds for photography.</p>
<p><span>Homosexual practices and extra marital relations are illegal and subject to severe penalties. This includes inviting guests onto the boat.</span></p></div>
