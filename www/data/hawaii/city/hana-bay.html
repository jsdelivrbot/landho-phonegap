<div class="hello"><div><p>Many places in the bay are good anchorages, including off the old pier, which is no longer in use. It is not safe; do not land on it.</p>
<p>When the trade winds are blowing strongly, the anchorage is uncomfortable, but in light or southerly winds, it remains calm.</p>
<p>The holding is good in mud and sand in about  25ft.</p>
