<div class="hello"><div><p>Call the Honokohau Harbour Master to find out where/if there is a mooring available.</p>
<p>Anchoring, even where allowed, is not recommended due to the very poor holding and strong winds which can affect this area.</p>
<p>Ensure you keep clear of the tugs and army supply boats which constantly ply this harbour.</p>
<p>Currently there are no facilities in the South Basin.</p>
