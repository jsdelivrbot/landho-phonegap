<div class="hello"><div><p>See information above regarding the current situation.</p>
<p>Below is the previous information (January 2010) which was on Noonsite when visiting the island was still possible. Officials hope that in the future visits will again be permitted.</p>
<p><i>Before leaving for Midway, you must contact the USFWS at either Honolulu or Midway to advise them of your expected arrival date and to receive special instructions. These include an undertaking not to stop at any other islands in the Hawaiian chain between Kauai and Midway, and to stand off if necessary in order to make your approach in daylight.</i></p>
<p><i>There are 6 moorings here for visitors for which a daily charge is made. They are located in the inner harbour on Sand Island. </i></p>
<p><i>There is a dinghy landing at the west end of the inner harbour.</i></p>
<p><i>The is also a charge per person while at the Refuge.</i></p>
