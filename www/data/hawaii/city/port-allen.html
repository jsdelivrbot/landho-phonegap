<div class="hello"><div><p>The small boat harbour is on the eastern side of the port.</p>
<p>It is best to call ahead for a berth as the harbourmaster, who looks after several harbours, may not be on site when you arrive.</p>
<p>Anchoring here is strongly discouraged due to the high chance of the boat dragging ashore.</p>
<p>A swell enters here in southerly winds.</p>
<p>Wahiawa Bay, just to the SE of the town, is a useful, though small, anchorage. The holding is good in mud and sand.</p>
