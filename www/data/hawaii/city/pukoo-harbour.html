<div class="hello"><div><p>Most of the inner harbour is a private facility, but the three areas in the outer harbour all offer safe anchorages.</p>
<p>There is a dinghy landing near the palm trees at the eastern end of the public beach. These trees also offer the best clue (together with two large houses on the hill behind) that you have found the harbour.</p>
<p>Don't rely on electronic charts for the entrance as some are known to be inaccuate. The break in the reef is visually noticable and is about 140m wide. Depth is about 3 to 6m with the deepest water on the eastern side.</p>
<p>The first anchorage area is the largest and has a sandy bottom but is subject to some roll. The two anchorages further in are very calm and care must be taken to set the anchor in a patch of sand between the rocks.</p>
<p>No toilets or showers ashore.</p>
