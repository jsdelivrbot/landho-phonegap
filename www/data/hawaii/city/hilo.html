<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Radio Bay Anchorage</strong><br/> Whilst there has been talk of closing Radio Bay since 2009 (see <a href="Members/sue/R2009-07-06-4"><strong>report</strong></a> adjacent) it is still open to cruising yachts as of May 2012. However, a report in 2014 indicates that cruising boats now all use Reeds Bay.</p>
<p>There are local moorings present with floats attached, however these are not suitable for cruising yachts. It is possible to berth at the sea wall, but the hull and fenders will get filthy. The cockroaches here can also be a problem. Anchoring may be a better option.</p>
<p>The anchorage and seawall are inside the port security area, so it is necessary to walk round the eastern end of the secure area to approach the port entrance.</p>
<p>There are toilets and showers by the Seawall. Currently no key is required for the facilities key. Water and electricity are available on the dock.</p>
<p><strong>Reeds Bay</strong><br/>Previously not a recommended anchorage as much of the bottom is silt over lava rock. Once the wind blows the anchor digs in and encounters lava rock slab - next thing you know you are on the rocky shore.</p>
<p>However, a cruiser reports that, with help of local knowledge, there is good holding in places (about 2 boat length after the last buoy but far from the Radio Bay seawall - closer to the seawall the holding is not good). See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Hawaii/hawaii-hilo-report-on-a-visit-in-summer-2012"><strong>report</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The dinghy can be taken ashore in two places in Reeds Bay: Either on the left hand side of Reeds Bay in a little park or on the beach on the right hand side of Reeds Bay, where also free showers can be found.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorage off the Boat Harbour</strong><br/> From the end of the breakwater, head towards the main beach where they keep canoes. As you near the beach you will see the leading markers for the harbour. Anchor just outside the markers and off the channel.</p>
