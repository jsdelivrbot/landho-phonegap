<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour is protected from the strong winds by the mountains to the east, with also cause it to be in someting of a rain shadow. </p>
<p>The downside of this harbour is the surge, which is especially to be noted and prepared for. In winter months, it can be sufficient to prevent entrance or exit from the harbour.</p>
<p>Call the Harbour Master for a free slip. </p>
<p>Alternatively, anchor in Pola'i Bay where you may find the surge is less. The best position is at the southern end of the bay, either just inside or just off the end of the breakwater. The holding is good in sand. There are toilets and cold shower on the shore here.</p>
