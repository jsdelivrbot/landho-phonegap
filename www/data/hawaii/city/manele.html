<div class="hello"><div><p>Nearly all the people living on this, the smallest of the inhabited islands in the Hawaiian group, reside in Lanai City. This town, originally built for the workers in the pineapple growing industry, sits on the high ground at the centre of the island.</p>
<p>Manele Bay is on the southern coast and is the only harbour where there are any facilities. </p>
<p>If visiting Kaumalapau Harbour, use your own ground tackle as none of the moorings there are to be trusted. Anchor in the southern half of the bay as the holding is good in the sand, but use two anchors as the wind can abruptly veer from east to north when the trade winds are strong.</p>
Position 20° 44'28"N, 156° 53'05"W. (Boat harbour)

<div class="hello"><div><p>Being the only harbour on the island, this is a busy place and finding a berth here is not often possible. Also the slips are subject to considerable surge which does not affect those at anchor outside the breakwater.</p>
<p>Anchor inside the breakwater in about 2m and having dropped the bow anchor, use the dinghy to tie a stern line to one of the mooring rings on the sea wall.</p>
<p>In calm weather it is possible to anchor outside the breakwater in about 10m, ensuring that you anchor in sand and avoid damaging the coral. Anchoring here has the advantage of avoiding your boat being covered in the red dust which blows over the harbour, as well as being in clean, clear water.</p>
<p>There are toilets and (cold) showers at the harbour.</p>
<p>There are several day-use mooring to allow exploration of the reefs. See <a href="http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dobor/day-use-moorings/locations/"><b>Day-Use moorings Locations.</b></a></p>
