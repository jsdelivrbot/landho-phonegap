<div class="hello"><div><p>The future of Palmyra Atoll as a nature reserve is guaranteed as it is now owned jointly by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the US Fish and Wildlife Department. Visits by yachts must be arranged in advance with TNC. The shoreside staff monitor VHF Channel 16. Note that most of the charts of Palmyra can be off by up to a quarter of a mile or more.</p>
<p>Yachts are permitted to stop for one week only, and there are strict limits as to where you can go without a guide. Water may be available, but no other supplies.</p>
<p>As the pass into the lagoon is not easy to identify a large notch has been cut into the palm trees on shore, and this conspicuous V must be brought in line with a white beacon located inside the lagoon, some 100 yards from the shore. By following the range one will avoid all dangers, and the range should not be left until close to the beacon, when you can turn right and anchor in approximately 50 ft. Under no circumstances should the lagoon be entered at night as there are many unmarked dangers just outside the narrow channel.</p>
