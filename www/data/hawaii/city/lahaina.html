<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is easily identified by locating the tall chimney with a black band at the top. It is about half a mile north of the harbour entrance. The gap through the reef is buoyed.</p>
<p>Yachts prefer to come here after completing formalities at Kahului commercial harbour. </p>
<p>There are no visitors' berths in the marina, although the Harbour master will try and find a berth for yachts needing repairs.</p>
<p>Yachts can anchor off the town but the holding is poor as there is only a thin layer of sand over dead coral.</p>
<p>The best option is to use one of the 7 free Lahaina Yacht Club mooring (white balls and marked LYC). Check the security of the mooring and then check in with the yacht club on Front Street. The anchorage is rolly here so it is best to rig an anti-roll device of some type.</p>
<p>A calmer anchorage can be found a little further north at the far end of the town.</p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock where they can be left for a fee.</p>
