<div class="hello"><div><p>Honokohau is the safest harbour on the island as it was blasted out of solid rock. It is also the only place where boats can be hauled out.</p>
<p>There are no designated visitors' berths and it is necessary to call the harbour master (VHF channel 16 or Tel:808-327-3685 or 808-327-3686) to find out if there is a space. Mooring is med-style with buoys at the stern.</p>
<p>Facilities ashore are poor and there is no electricity at the public berths.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the private Gentry's marina may have space if you call in advance.</p>
<p><i>Anchorages</i><br/> If the harbour is full, there is an anchorage just north of the entrance channel. There are quite a few patches of coral as well as sand.  Depth is about 25 to 30ft. Any stay here is limited to 72 hours.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor off Kailua-Kona Wharf, about 3.5 miles south. There are charges for anchoring and use of facilities onshore. It is very rolly here.</p>
