<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the most important harbour on Kaua'i. It lies on the SE side of the island, about two miles southwest of Lihue. Cruisers report Nov. 2010 that it is no longer possible to clear in here, yachts have to go to Honolulu.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This the most secure harbour on the island and is safe in almost all conditions except the most severe hurricanes.</p>
<p>Once through the harbour entrance, turn to port and the small boat harbour is ahead of you. Tie to the loading dock, east of the slipway, while checking with the harbour office for a vacant berth.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor on the inside of the small boat harbour breakwater, in about 3 to 8m. The bottom is good holding in mud.</p>
<p>Anchoring is not permitted in any other part of the harbour.</p>
<p>There are 5 shallow draft moorings for catamarans.</p>
