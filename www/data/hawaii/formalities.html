            </h2>
<div><p>Hawaiian entry regulations are basically the same as the rest of the United States (see <a href="Countries/USA?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/USA/Formalities</strong></a> page), but there are slight differences and regulations are usually applied in a more detailed manner. This is partly due to the fact that to arrive in Hawaii from the US mainland, yachts must leave US territorial waters.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Yachts must report immediately on arrival to Customs and formal clearance must be made within 48 hours of arrival. Working hours are 08:00-16:30 Monday to Friday. (Vessels arriving at the weekend may have to wait until Monday to obtain clearance). Vessels that have cellphones can call Customs before arriving to minimise the waiting time. After hours, it is necessary to telephone Customs.</p>
<p>A Ships Stores Declaration and Crew's Effects Declaration must be made as well as showing the clearance (zarpe) from the previous port. Customs may handle immigration and health formalities in some places. First contact the Harbour Master who will inform Customs.</p>
<p>On arrival no one must go ashore except for the person reporting the arrival to Customs, who must afterwards return to the yacht, until formalities are completed. Violations of this rule can result in heavy penalties, even forfeiture of the boat.</p>
<p>Yachts must enter at an official port of entry. Yachts stopping elsewhere may be liable for heavy fines. This rule also applies to US registered vessels coming from foreign ports; they must call at an official port of entry before proceeding elsewhere. American captains have been fined for making landfall at other Hawaiian ports and attempting to clear Customs by telephone.</p>
<p>US vessels arriving from a US port on the mainland who have not stopped at a foreign port en route or have had no contact with any other vessel at sea, and who have only US citizens on board, do not need to clear Customs, but must be inspected on arrival by an agricultural inspector of the State of Hawaii. They must inform the agricultural department of their arrival.</p>
<p>After having cleared into Hawaii, US vessels are free to go anywhere in the USA.</p>
<p>Most foreign vessels now required to have a cruising licence.</p>
<p>Yachts from the following countries are eligible for a cruising permit:-</p>
<p>Anguilla, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, BVI, Canada, Cayman Islands, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain,  Greece, Honduras, Ireland, Jamaica, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, St Kitts &amp; Nevis, St Vincent, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Foreign vessels without a cruising licence must check in with Customs at every other port they visit. Precise instructions of the procedure will be given at the first port of entry.</p>
<p>Hawaii Administrative Rules that require a vessel that plans to stay in Hawaii waters for 60 days or longer, has to obtain  an HA number from Vessel Registration (see contact below).</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine</strong></p>
<p>Quarantine must be notified if there are animals on board or if coming from any country outside the USA or Canada, in which case any fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs and certain food items will be confiscated and destroyed. Quarantine may also ask for all rubbish on board to be given to them for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>On departure all yachts, including US registered vessels, must obtain a Customs clearance form for foreign destinations.</p>

<div><p>US regulations state that foreign yachts from certain countries can obtain a cruising licence on arrival, which exempts them from having to clear in and out in each port once the first entry clearance is completed.</p>
<p>The countries which are eligible for this licence are Argentina, Austria, Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Liberia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom (including Turks and Caicos, St Vincent, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, St Kitts and Anguilla).</p>
<p>This list, which includes countries that grant similar privileges to US yachts, is subject to change. The licence is issued on entry by Customs. It is valid for up to one year. Successive licences are not usually granted.</p>
<p>Foreign yachts, whether or not holding a cruising licence, are still required to notify Customs by telephone on arrival in major ports.</p>
<p>Yachts <strong>not entitled</strong> to a cruising licence must obtain a Permit to Proceed to each subsequent port and they must make entry at all major ports while cruising Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>From November 10th 2014</strong>, Skippers of any boat with an engine over 10hp must be in possession of a Certificate of Competence with an endorsement for Hawaiian waters. The only exception is a foreign-flagged cruising boat staying for less than 60 days. See <a href="http://files.hawaii.gov/dlnr/dobor/rules/amend/Amend-13-244-15-5.pdf"><strong>this document</strong></a> for details. There is a minimum fine of $50.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>A controversial regulation, which has been resisted by local sailors, is the 72 hour anchoring limit. Although brought in to deal with a large number of derelict vessels, the rule has been applied against cruising boats too. It is reported that the rule now only applies to the island of Oahu. Cruising boats are free to anchor for longer periods at all other islands, provided they are not left unattended.</p>
<p>Many Hawaiian bays have been designated Marine Conservation Areas, and anchoring is prohibited in some of them. The government booklet "Marine Life Conservation Districts" gives more information on local restrictions.</p>
<p>Nihau Island is reserved for native Hawaiians. It can only be visited with official permission.</p>
<p>Military areas: Kahoolawe Island, just south of Maui, was previously used as a firing range by the US Navy. Jurisdiction has reverted to the State of Hawaii, but unexploded ordnance is still being cleared from the island. Before landing at this island, check with the customs office on Maui to get the latest information and clearance.</p>
<p>The Midway Islands, 28°13'N 177°24'W, at the western extremity of the Hawaiian group, are not part of the state of Hawaii, and are administered by the US Navy. Johnston Atoll 16°45'N 169°31'W is administered by the US Air Force and is to be used for dumping chemical weapons as well as other military purposes. Part of the atoll is a wildlife refuge. The waters within a three-mile radius of both Midway and Johnston are off-limits to yachts unless they have special permission. In case of a real emergency, permission to enter would probably be given. In such a case one should contact the US Coast Guard or the Rescue Coordination Centre in Honolulu. Yachts should note that mooring fees (US$1/foot/day) and entry fees ($300) will be charged. For details, visit <a href="http://midway.fws.gov/fees.html">http://midway.fws.gov/fees.html</a></p>
<p>Remote Island Wildlife Refuges: These are administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Honolulu. Refuge Complex Office, PO Box 50167, <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">http://www.fws.gov/</a> Permission to land will only be given for legitimate reasons. These areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NW part of the Hawaiian archipelago, including Nihoa Island, but not Midway, from 161°W to 176°W.</li>
<li>Howland, Baker and Jarvis Islands, on the equator SSW of Hawaii. In 1990 they were included within Hawaii state boundaries by Congress.</li>
<li>Kure Island, west of Midway. Access is restricted to this island, which is administered by the state of Hawaii.</li>
<li>Palmyra Atoll 5°53'N 162°05'W is now owned jointly by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the US Fish and Wildlife (USF&amp;W;) Department, and is managed as a nature preserve. Visits by yachts must be arranged in advance with TNC.</li>
<li>Wake Island 19°18'N 166°38'E is administered by the US Air Force but yachts can stop. The pass into the lagoon is not deep enough to enter so one has to anchor off the reef, making it only a temporary stop. Only military and contract workers live there.</li>
</ul>
<p>In June 2006 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument was created, to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and including the NW Hawaiian Archipelago and Midway Islands.

<div><p>Hawaii is rabies-free, so regulations regarding animals on board yachts are more strict than on the US mainland. </p>
<p>Animals must be declared on arrival, and will have to be sent to the Quarantine Centre in Honolulu within 72 hours, where they may have to remain for 120 days or until the yacht leaves Hawaii.  </p>
<p>This extended quarantine time for pets entering Hawaii from non-exempt areas (such as continental USA) has changed.  If you do your research and can get all the paperwork and chores done prior to going over, your pet can qualify for the "5-day-or-less" quarantine program.  It takes advanced planning, and takes about 4.5 months minimum lead time to pull off if you push it, but it is achievable.</p>
<p><a href="http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/ai/aqs/aqs-checklist-5.pdf">http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/ai/aqs/aqs-checklist-5.pdf</a> : has all the information.</p>
<p>There is a daily fee for quarantine, which must be paid in advance; unused days will be refunded. The quarantine station should be given 24 to 48 hours' notice of departure and they will deliver the animal to the yacht. Penalties are very heavy for violation of this regulation.</p>
<p>As air transport costs from other islands must be paid by the animal's owner, it is better to make Honolulu the port of entry if one has an animal on board. </p>
