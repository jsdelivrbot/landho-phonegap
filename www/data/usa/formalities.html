<div><p>US Customs is now part of the Department of Homeland Security and is called Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Security has increased at entry points to the US for both US and foreign-flagged vessels.</p>
<p><strong>New Requirement Jan 2016:</strong> CBP now requires <strong>ALL</strong> foreign-flagged boats (including any registered under SVRS and LBO schemes) to obtain a <strong>Cruising Licence</strong>. Once issued, it is valid for up to 1 year. See <a href="Countries/USA?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p>As part of this enhanced security, <strong>most yachts (including US and Canadian ones)</strong> are required to submit a float plan under the Small Vessel Registration Scheme (SVRS). See the <a href="https://svrs.cbp.dhs.gov/"><strong>offical US website</strong></a> for the details. This also applies to those boaters registered under the LBO and NEXUS schemes. This online system allows you to "pre-establish" yourself with the CBP and in many cases avoid having to physically report to a Customs office when you enter the US from a foreign country on a small vessel. For those returning to the US from the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, USVI's or Canada, this free scheme offers a much quicker and easier option for clearing back into the USA.</p>
<p>For foreign boats, however, a face-to-face inspection is usually required and a Port of Entry must be used. Call +1 (800) 432-1216 or +1 (800) 451-0393. Procedures vary slightly depending on where entry is made. Current regulations regarding  entry clearance and cruising licence are on the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/travel/pleasure-boats-private-flyers/pleasure-boat-overview"><strong>US government site</strong></a>. Cruisers recommend not arriving in the US on Fri/Sat/Sun as the phone line is constantly engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Noonsite has been advised by CBP that they are unable to call back to international phone numbers, so take this into account when making contact with a CBP office.</p>
<p>Non-US flagged yachts and non-commercial pleasure vessels under 300 gross tons do not have to report their arrival in advance.</p>
<p>Increased security means that although yachts may continue to obtain Customs clearance on entry into the US by telephone, that clearance is not valid until Immigration clearance has been obtained in person at the nearest INS office. (the immigration offices of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection).</p>
<p>The captain, and every other person on board, regardless of nationality, are required to report to the nearest INS Office after arriving in a port of entry. US nationals must take with them a valid passport. All non-US nationals must take passports <i>with valid visas</i>, and a Green Card if held.  If you arrive after working hours, contact the CBP immediately, but face-to-face inspection may not be possible until the following morning. During this time, you must remain on board, and clear immediately the next morning. You must report your arrival immediately upon arrival no matter what time of day, but you must conduct your customs/immigration clearance procedures within 24-hours of arrival. You can download the Entry Clearance statement from this <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/CBP%20Form%201300_1.pdf"><strong>CBP web page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The nearest INS office might be some distance away from your chosen port of entry, requiring an expensive taxi. You may not be allowed to rent a car until you have an entry stamp in your passport. It would be worthwhile selecting an entry port where an INS office is within a short distance. Here is the current list of <strong><a href="http://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports">Ports of Entry</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The US Coast Guard has the power to board any vessel within US territorial waters and they <i>frequently</i> do this, particularly off Florida. They can also board any US flag vessel anywhere in the world. All vessels entering the 12 mile territorial waters must fly the Q flag until clearance procedures have been conducted. A US Coast Guard boarding or customs inspection offshore does NOT constitute a customs clearance procedure.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the correct procedures <span>on arrival</span> (particularly in reference to reporting arrival in a timely manner, or disembarking your vessel without permission) can lead to a substantial fine and seizure of the offending vessel.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Yachts<br/></strong><span>The captain must report the arrival of the yacht to Customs immediately and make formal entry within 24 hours. On arrival everyone must remain on board, except for the captain going ashore to report the arrival of the yacht. Documents needed include registration papers, a declaration of both ship's stores and crew's possessions, last port clearance, and a crew list. Clearance must be completed with Customs, Immigration, Health and Agriculture. Sometimes the Customs officer performs some or all of these other duties. On departure from the USA, yachts must clear out with Customs.</span></p>
<p>Foreign-flagged yachts (including Canadian ones, not in possession of a cruising licence), are normally required to notify Customs (Homeland Security) when moving from one customs region to another, i.e.from Ft Lauderdale to Miami. There are fines for vessels who do not comply. See the <a href="Members/val/R2009-02-28-2"><strong>Noonsite/USA reporting</strong></a> article for more information. <strong>Note: There appears to be some confusion over whether this rule applies if the vessel has a cruising licence. It is advisable to obtain a written copy of the procedure to be followed when initially clearing in or being issued with a cruising licence. </strong><strong>See <a href="Countries/USA?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Noonsite/USA/Documents</strong></a> for the list of countries whose boats are eligible for a cruising permit.</strong></p>
<p><span>One thing to be aware of, is that the various states often interpret these federal regulations differently, or apply local rules to suit a local situation. If possible, contact the officials at your chosen Port of Entry in advance to check requirements. CBP officers are normally helpful and will notify you of any updated laws or procedures.</span></p>
<p><i>If you are notified of a customs/immigration regulation that we have not updated on Noonsite, <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:noonsite@noonsite.com?subject=Customs/Immigration Regulation Update"><b>please email us</b></a> and we will update our database.</i></p>
<p>It is recommended to keep records of your checking-in activities, such as name and badge number of any officials you check in with, email receipts of notification, as well ensuring that the yacht's details and movement have in fact been entered onto the automated system.</p>
<p>See Noonsite's <a href="Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents</strong></a> page for more requirements for foreign yachts.</p>
<p><strong>US Registered Yachts<br/></strong><span>On arrival in the USA from a foreign port all US yachts must report their arrival to the CBP within 24 hours, and also report any merchandise acquired abroad that is subject to duty. If an inspection is required, the Customs officer will direct the yacht to an inspection area. New security regulations compel US nationals to now report arrivals immediately and complete immigration clearance within 24 hours of arrival.</span></p>
<p>Customs do not have to be notified when US boats leave for a foreign port, although most countries require the last port clearance for their own entry procedure. It is advisable to obtain this outbound "zarpe" before leaving the USA. (<i>see last paragraph in this section for details)</i></p>
<p><strong>Cuba<br/></strong><span>US yachts are </span><strong>not</strong><span> forbidden by law from cruising in Cuba, but  they do have to complete various forms.</span></p>
<p><strong>All</strong> crew must to comply with one of the 12 'exceptions' (which categorise the reason for the visit) and then obtain <span> USCG form 3300. This then permits the boat to visit Cuba for a maximum of 2 weeks. For more information on this  procedure, see this <a href="Countries/USA/cuba-clarification-of-the-rules-for-us-yachts-visiting-cuba"><strong>Report from Facebook</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>Yachts returning to the United States from Cuba can expect to be boarded. The amount of difficulties reported by US yachts varies and seems to depend on individual officials. Cuban officials will co-operate and not stamp US passports.</p>
<p>On leaving Florida for Cuba, it is mandatory to notify the US Coast Guard and obtain clearance for crossing the security zone into Cuban waters.</p>
<p><i>Foreign flagged</i> vessels not should have a problem traveling between Cuba and the US, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key West should be avoided</span> for clearing-in as several foreign yachts coming from Cuba have experienced problems here and were either denied a cruising permit or had an existing one cancelled and had to leave the country. We have been advised that Palm Beach or Fort Lauderdale is a better choice.</p>
<p>Another option for both US and foreign boats is to leave Cuba for another country (such as the Bahamas) and make entry into the United States from there.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that any US citizens, whether on a US or foreign flagged boat, still have to fulfill one of the <span>12 'exceptions' categorizing the reason for their visit. ('People-to-people' or 'education' are the easiest ones to officially comply with).</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruising Between Canada and USA<br/></strong><span>For Canadian and American citizens there is a scheme which simplifies border formalities.  NEXUS is a joint US/Canadian customs and immigration program for frequent travelers between the two countries.  It replaces the I-68. NEXUS is designed to simplify procedures  for pre-approved, low-risk boaters who regularly cross the boarder. It allows such boaters to clear Customs and Immigration of either Canada or the U.S.A. by contacting the Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) within 30 minutes and up to 4 hours prior to arrival.</span></p>
<p>See the <a href="http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/marine-maritime-eng.html"><strong>Nexus Program website</strong></a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Other Frequent Passage Schemes<br/></strong><span>The Local Boater Option (LBO) is a similar scheme operating in Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, which allows pleasure boat reporting by telephone. See this</span><strong> <a href="Members/sue/R2010-03-12-1">Noonsite/report</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>The Small Vessel Reporting System is specifically for boaters who are enrolled in the LBO program. It is a web-based automated on-line reporting system created for LBO participants to expeditiously report their intended arrivals from foreign countries. Open to both US and Canadian citizens, you must apply on line at <a href="https://goes-app.cbp.dhs.gov/main/goes"><strong>https://goes-app.cbp.dhs.gov/main/goes</strong>/</a> and you must still call in by phone upon arrival in the US. The program requires you to file a float plan on line as well, which offers a tremendous safety benefit.</p>
<p><i>Note: this system is only available in certain areas (details on the website) and does still appear to have "teething" problems both with the usability of the website and lack of knowledge among customs agents.</i></p>
<p><strong>Obtaining a "Zarpe"</strong><br/> The US is not generally set up to issue outward clearance, but the US Dept of Homeland security use CBP Form 1300 for a Zarpe for commercial vessels. <a class="external-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/CBP%20Form%201300_1.pdf"><b>The form can be obtained here</b></a>. Get this stamped by Customs at a port or airport, and if this is not possible, get it notarized by a lawyer. Some cruisers have encountered confusion from the Customs officers when getting a stamp on this form by pleasure yachts as it is typically for commercial vessels (they do not have a dedicated form for non-commercial vessels) so it may be easier to use a notary. (<i>Noonsite has received a report that this works very well.)</i></p>
<p>This CBP Form 1300 procedure is common (and important to follow) especially in Puerto Rico and the USVI when the next port of call is the Dominican Republic or any of the Windward Islands.</p>

<div><p><strong>Important Notice:-</strong><br/> All nationalities, whether entering and/or leaving the US by private yacht MUST obtain a <strong>visa in advance</strong>. Such visitors CANNOT enter the USA <strong>for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first time</span></strong> under the Visa Waiver Programme.</p>
<p><span>It is essential to plan ahead, as obtaining a visa for the US is not a quick process. A personal interview at an embassy or consulate is required, together with the recording (in a US database) of the applicant's biometric data (e.g. fingerprints). Professional crew should apply for a B1/B2 visa.</span></p>
<p><span>The only exceptions to visa requirements are Canadian citizens who are permanent residents in Canada.</span></p>
<p>Look at <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/travel/pleasure-boats-private-flyers/svrs"><strong>US Website on entry information for yachts</strong></a> for the latest detailed information.</p>
<p>Every person entering the United States must be seen in person by an Immigration officer, except those participating in the Canadian Border Small Boat Program (NEXUS).</p>
<p>US citizens should carry proof of citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate. All foreign nationals must carry a passport. US citizens entering the United States from countries outside the Western Hemisphere must also carry their passport.</p>
<p>See <a href="Countries/USA/usa-immigration-problems-of-which-to-be-aware"><strong>this Noonsite report</strong></a> for possible complications if entering from Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign yachtsmen entering the USA from the Caribbean</strong></p>
<p>See articles <a href="Members/sue/R2008-06-19-3"><strong>Noonsite report on Making use of the US Visa Waiver for entry into the USVIs</strong></a> and <a href="Members/val/R2012-04-03-3"><strong>Noonsite/Accurate Information for Yachtsmen Entering the USA</strong></a>. If planning to make use of this method of entering  USVIs or Puerto Rico, it is necessary to have completed an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). This can be completed online and cost $14. An ESTA is valid to 2 years but it does not guarantee entry to the United States. Entry under the Visa Waiver program is valid for a visit of up to 90 days from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first entry</span> into the USA or its Caribbean territories. Such an entry permit will then allow onward travel to mainland USA by yacht. See <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/frequently-asked-questions-about-visa-waiver-program-vwp-and-electronic-system-travel"><strong>US website</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p>For an up to date list of countries whose citizens are eligible for entry to the US under the Visa Waiver Program see this <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program-requirements"><strong>US Government website</strong></a>. Such citizens must still have been granted an ESTA and (from April 2016) <span>have a biometric chip in their passport (not just a machine readable one as previously). </span></p>
<p>It is worth repeating: a visa waiver <strong>does not apply</strong> if entering the USA for the first time by yacht.</p>
