<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying just north of the border with Mexico, San Diego is a natural Port of Entry/Exit for yachts cruising the west coast. The large area of San Diego Bay provides a large area of sheltered water for sailing and berthing.</p>
<p>Position 32°42′54″N, 117°09′45″W. </p></div></div>
<h2 id="PortClearance">
                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Since international security has been beefed-up, it is important that the rules relating to clearance are strictly adhered to. Going into Mexican waters, even for a day, entails reporting your arrival on return. The U.S.-Mexico border is clearly marked as a dotted line on all navigation charts. Two white boundary monuments on shore line up as range markers, and at night, the border is marked by a white flashing light (fl 4, 5s) from a tower that stands 157 feet high. Just south of the monuments is the Tijuana bull ring, a round structure more easily visible on a hazy day than the monuments.</p>
<p>San Diego is the first port of entry into the U.S. for coastal boats coming up from Mexico.  Yachts coming in from Hawaii can lay a direct course for Los Angeles/Long Beach, but a yacht coming up from Mexico that does not clear Customs at San Diego must remain outside the three-mile limit.</p>
<p>There are 2 reporting stations in the San Diego area; Shelter Island and Dana Launch Ramp Public Dock, <span>Mission Bay.</span></p>
<p>For Shelter Island, go alongside the gated San Diego Harbour Police dock on the south end of the island in San Diego Bay. Do not go to the larger municipal guest docks to the north. Only the skipper may go through the gate and only for the purpose of contacting U.S. Customs and Border Authorities. There is a payphone near the gate or at the Harbour Police and moorings building.  Phone star (*)82 and request to be cleared into the U.S. Alternatively dial 1 619 685 4300, option #4 from another phone.</p>
<p>If the Harbour Police dock is occupied, you may pick up one of the yellow quarantine mooring buoys just across the channel.</p>
<p>The Mission Bay reporting station is at the Dana Launch Ramp Public Dock at Dana Landing Road, Mission Bay. This station can only be used by vessels of less than 50 ft and with under 42 ft air draft as this clearance is needed to pass under the Ventura Bridge (at LW). On arrival call 1 619 685 4300, Option #4.</p>
<p>During heightened alerts, U.S. Coast Guard patrols routinely stop to question or board vessels entering San Diego and Mission bays.  A boarding by the Coast Guard does not fulfill the requirement to report your arrival and clear customs at the Harbour Police dock.</p>
