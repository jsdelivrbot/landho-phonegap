<p>Morro Bay Harbor is located on the central coast of California about midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Its famous landmark, Morro Rock, was named by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo when he first charted this coast during his 16th Century voyage of discovery. </p>
<p>The harbor is protected from the effects of the open ocean by two rubble-mound breakwaters, an inner harbor groin, and a stone revetment. Prior to the latest channel improvements, the harbor was known as one of the most dangerous in the United States because of steep and breaking waves in the entrance. Improvements in 1995 consisted of a deepened, expanded entrance channel, and a sand trap within the harbor entrance structures. </p>
<p>Morro Bay entrance is perfectly safe IF the seas are not over 9 ft and period of not under 12 seconds. Checking the Diablo buoy (station 46215) is the best judge of what the entrance is doing.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage is between buoy marker 10 and 12 and just to the west of the
main channel. Be careful of the shoals to the west of the anchorage. Stay
to the east of the floating dock at the south end of the anchorage. Holding
is mud/sand and excellent.</p>
<p>There is a large guest dock with a sanitary pump out just before the channel
turns to the southeast adjacent to a small park. The pump out is kept
locked so a call on channel 12 to the Harbor Master will be needed.</p>
<p>There are two dingy docks near buoy marker 12. There is another one down
the harbor, just before the guest dock adjacent to the floating crane. This
dock is directly across from a good Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>The Morro Bay Yacht Club has a guest dock with power and a sanitary pump out
station, or if you prefer they have guest moorings adjacent to their facility.
There are instructions at their guest dock for who to contact when you arrive.</p>
