<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach to Juneau is via the <span>Gastineau Channel which lies between Douglas Island and the mainland. It is spanned by a bridge with a clearance of 66 ft at low tide. It has a height gauge.</span></p>
<p><span>To reach both Harris and Aurora Harbours, is it necessary to pass under the <span>Douglas bridge. Harris Harbour is closer to downtown.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If unable to pass under the bridge, then Douglas Harbour is on the west bank before the bridge, opposite downtown. These three are the main marinas in Juneau.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For short stays the <span>Intermediate Vessel Float is useful as it is in the heart of downtown.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are several other private marinas and boat docks in the area.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span><span>Taku Harbor is a useful overnight mooring pontoon 22 miles south east of Juneau. See <a href="http://www.juneau.org/harbors/TakuHarbor.php"><strong>Photos</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Auke Bay, north west of Juneau airport has a large marina, </span></span><span>Statter Harbor, tucked into the NE corner. It has over 300 visitors' berths.</span></p>
