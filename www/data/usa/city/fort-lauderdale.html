<div class="hello"><div><p>This <span>popular tourist destination lies on Florida's south east coast about 20nm north of Miami. It is a major yacht centre with over 100 marinas and every conceivable repair facility, including one of the largest boat yards in the USA.</span></p>
<p><span>Port Everglades is the third busiest cruise port in the world. It handles more than 3.4 million passengers each year and often 10 or more cruise ships enter and exit the port every day. It is the busiest container ship port in Florida. Keep a careful watch out for ships with limited maneuverability.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hundreds of luxury megayachts call Fort Lauderdale home and some marinas accompany hotels or resorts and can be relatively expensive, especially the marinas directly on the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), which winds directly through the middle of Fort Lauderdale.</span></span></p>

<p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">USA Formalities </a></strong><span>for full details on clearing into and out of the USA.</span></p>
<p><span>It is common practice at this Port of Entry to proceed to the nearest marina and, once docked, contact the local CBP Reporting Station by telephone. Under no circumstances may crew disembark or leave the dock until clearance procedures have been conducted. Crew of pleasure craft must report to the CBP reporting office in a timely manner t<span>o receive passport stamps and customs clearance, which requires appearing in person to the office.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Most marinas in the Ft.Lauderdale area are located along the winding Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). Pay close attention to the channel markings. Almost no anchoring is allowed except on buoys or authorized areas. New municipal laws in Broward County, Florida, prohibit anchoring within 300ft/100m from a private dock or residential property, meaning almost no locations in the narrow canals of Ft.Lauderdale are legal anchorages. These new laws mean that it is nearly unavoidable to visit Ft.Lauderdale without staying in a marina, which can be expensive.</p>
<p>There is a popular anchorage at Lake Sylvia at 26º06.291N, 80º06.694W. Be aware of extreme shallows in the area.</p>
<p>Be aware of the state of tide as the current can run across the entrance to some marinas.</p>
