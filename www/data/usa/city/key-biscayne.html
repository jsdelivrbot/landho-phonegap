<div class="hello"><div><p>Key Biscayne is an island and city in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It is located immediately south of Miami Beach and connected to the City of Miami via the Rickenbacker Causeway, a 5.5 mile long bridge.</p>
<p>Key Biscayne is a favorite first stop for many cruising sailors coming up from the Caribbean, but clearance/immigration procedures must first be handled at the nearby Miami Seaport.</p>
<p>Like the rest of southern Florida, Key Biscayne maintains summertime temperatures year-round, but it is often the first of the surrounding area to be evacuated when Atlantic hurricanes approach.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are shoals around Key Biscayne and care should be exercised while navigating in this area.</p>
<p>Various anchorages exist on the west side of the island. There is a hurricane harbour (appropriately named "Hurricane Harbor") on the west side of Key Biscayne; however, only shallow draught vessels can access the inner harbour. All other vessels can anchor north of a prominent sandbar near Nixon Beach for the best protection from weather.</p>
<p>There are two other mooring fields, which are reported to be viable storm moorings. One to the southwest of Crandon Park Marina, and another in a large bay to the northeast of Rickenbacker Marina. Both are regularly maintained by divers.</p>
