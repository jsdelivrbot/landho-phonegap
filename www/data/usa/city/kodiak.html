<div class="hello"><div><p>On approach call the Harbour Master on VHF channel 16 for advice on berth availability.</p>
<p>See this <a href="http://www.city.kodiak.ak.us/ph/page/maps"><b>Useful view</b></a> of the port.</p>
<p>The best place is in St. Paul Small Boat Harbour, which is in the middle of town. The harbour mainly caters for the fishing fleet and other professional services, but there are also a few sailing boats. The atmosphere is very friendly.</p>
<p>Rates are approx. $20 per day for a 40’ boat with a similar charge for electricity. A day is defined as midnight to midnight.(Aug 2015).</p>
<p>An alternative marina is St. Herman Harbour on Near Island, also within walking distance of the town. Also operated by the city.</p>
<p>Note that there are no toilets or showers at the harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong><br/> There are ample opportunities in the vicinity, but restrictions apply in the inner Boat Harbour.</p>
