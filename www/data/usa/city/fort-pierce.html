<div class="hello"><div><p>Fort Pierce and the Fort Pierce City Marina was left in ruins by back-to-back hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004. However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ensured that future natural disasters would not effect the city so dramatically and, since 2012, construction began on a series of artificial jetties and breakwaters that protect the city. As a result, the marinas in the area have been refreshed and revitalized and Fort Pierce has become a major stop for cruisers on the Great Loop.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The City of Fort Pierce sits directly on the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) and just inside the wide Fort Pierce Inlet. As elsewhere at ICW inlets, the tide runs strong and regularly can flow more than 1.5 knots in either direction. Celestial tides may occasionally cause the tide to run even faster.</p>
<p>Particularly in this area, follow all marked buoys. The US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers maintain the buoys well in areas that have ongoing construction, but the tide runs so strongly that smaller floating buoys may be pulled under or be difficult to see at night. Whilst there is little or no perceivable current inside the marinas, cruisers have reported experiencing cross-currents and eddies in the approach channel to the marinas.</p>
<p>Also, the North Causeway bridge opens on a schedule. When the tide is running, keep a close watch while waiting for this bridge. The current at the bridge can approach 1.5-2 knots in either direction. Many cruisers strategize their journey north to coincide with the tide coming in so that they get the extra speed, but the current pushes waiting boats toward the bridge.</p>
<p><b>Anchorage:</b><br/>Like elsewhere along the ICW, it is permissible to anchor anywhere outside marked channels. However, the strong tide flow in this area makes it necessary to carefully plan any anchoring and allow for swing. There is a relatively quiet popular anchorage just outside Harbortown Marina. Also, it is common to anchor in the protected areas against causeways and bridges: usually choose the leeward side.</p>
