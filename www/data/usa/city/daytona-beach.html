<div class="hello"><div><p>Daytona Beach is a major resort city on Florida's Atlantic Coast occupying both sides of the Intracoastal Waterway. It is home to the Daytona International Speedway and the Daytona 500 NASCAR race. It is also known for a variety of annual events including Bike Week and is a prominent destination for Spring Break, which is a week during the month of March when most universities and high schools are not in session and all the students head to the beach. During these major events, expect the area to become significantly more crowded and rowdy as the hotels, bars, and restaurants can fill to overflowing.</p>
<p>Besides its reputation as a destination for all things motorsport, the city boasts more than two dozen sites on the registry of National Historic Places.</p>
<p>Daytona Beach and the Ponce Inlet is the southern entry to the famous Palm Coast. The Palm Coast is home to beautiful canals lined with quiet residential communities and nature conservation areas. Pristine marinas are spaced out along the ICW and most are set up for cruising yachts of all kinds.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Daytona Beach spreads out on either side of the Halifax River, which also serves as the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). The only access to the sea is via the Ponce Inlet approximately 10 miles south. Tidal streams can run strong in and around the Ponce Inlet and shoaling has been known to occur in the inland waterways, including the ICW.</p>
<p>The Halifax River is crossed by four major bridges in Daytona Beach. Most of the yacht facilities for cruising yachts are south of the southernmost bridge, but there are also some facilities on the mainland side of the northernmost bridge as well.</p>
<p>There are important yachting facilities immediately south of the Ponce Inlet at Flagler and New Smyrna, FL.</p>
<p><span>Last updated September 2016.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anchorages:</strong><br/>It is possible to anchor outside the ICW channel. However be cautious in selecting an anchorage near marinas or close to piers. During certain times of the year, high volumes of local boating traffic will be present in the area.</p>
<p>Commercial fishing boats also make port in this area and use the Ponce Inlet on a daily basis.</p></div></div>
