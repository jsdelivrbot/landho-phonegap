<div class="hello"><div><p>Boston is a vibrant, thriving city, renowned for its cultural facilities, world-class educational institutions, champion sports franchises, beautiful harbour and islands, as well as its place at the very forefront of American history. Tourism is one of New England's largest industries and Boston is the region's social and commercial "hub".</p>
<p>Boston Harbour and its approaches are extremely well marked with aids to navigation. However you are encouraged to stay in marked channels at all times as the harbour is very rocky and you can get into trouble if you venture beyond. Average tide in Boston Harbour is 9.5 feet, however tides of 12 feet do occur on occasion.</p>
<p>Boston Harbour is home to the Boston Harbour Islands National Park Area and is comprised of 34 islands. The park was established by Congress in 1996 as a unit of the National Park Service (NPS).</p>
<p>Position <span>42° 21.67' N, 71° 03.01' W (Boston waterfront)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is very large harbour, sheltered by a chain of islands and fed by several navigatable rivers..</p>
<p>There are many marinas here, some in the heart of downtown Boston. Dinghy docks are also to be found along the downtown waterfront.</p>
<p><span>The airport lies on the east side of the harbour, so if wishing for a quieter berth, then one of the marinas at Quinsy might be your choice, although it is quite a distance from downtown Boston.</span></p>
<p>See <a href="http://ma.usharbors.com/harbor-guide/boston-harbor"><strong>http://ma.usharbors.com/harbor-guide/boston-harbor</strong></a> for very useful information about the harbour and rivers.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marblehead</span></span></p>
<p><span>This large, beautiful natural harbour lies about 20nm NE of Boston and is a popular stop for visiting yachts. The yacht clubs there manage the moorings, so contact the harbour Master for advice.</span></p>
