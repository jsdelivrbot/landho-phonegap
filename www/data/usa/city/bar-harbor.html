<div class="hello"><div><p>Bar Harbor lies on the east coast of Mount Desert Island which is about 70nm from the entrance to the Bay of Fundy and the border with Canada. Much of the island is designated <span>Acadia National Park. The downtown area of Bar Harbor is a lively place during the season and the area provides many opportunities for bird and sealife watching.</span></p>
<p><span>The harbour is visited by many cruise ships which anchor in the middle of the harbour.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Since Bar Harbor is an island and a popular place for both sailing and powerboating, there are many suitable moorings. Contact the Harbourmaster’s Office for availability.</p>
<p>The Town Pier has pontoons on each side for yachts and a minimum depth of about 2.5m. There are several other piers with visitors' moorings in the harbour.</p>
<p>The usual anchorage is south of the eastern end of Bar Island. The western end is connected to Mount<span> Desert Island by a</span> sand bar at low water. It is not the most comfortable place, being exposed to the wind and the wake of passing boats.</p>
<p>A more comfortable anchorage, although further from the town, can be found <span>on the northern and western sides of Bar Island. This is quite deep (15m+) and a shallower spot can be found just west of the island.</span></p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock on the west of the Town Pier.</p>
