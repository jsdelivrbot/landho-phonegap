<div class="hello"><div><p>Nearly the size of Delaware, Anchorage lies between the Chugach Mountains on the east and Knik Arm of Cook Inlet on the west. The surrounding mountain ranges provide a splendid setting. It has many fine restaurants and upscale shops. It has a surprisingly mild climate and in summer colourful flowers spill from hundreds of baskets on downtown lampposts.</p>
Position 61°13′N, 149°54′W.

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Currents in upper cook inlet caused by tidal action can be quite severe. Mud flats shift and make charts obsolete quickly. Cruising sailboats should approach Anchorage with great caution and obtain local knowledge ahead of time.</span></p>
<p>There is no known berthing facilities for cruising yachts here.</p>
<p>The nearest small boat harbour is at <a href="Countries/USA/seward/"><strong>Seward</strong></a> which is a good place to visit.</p>
<p>Other alternative destinations are the <span>Lower Cook inlet port of Homer and Seldovia. Both have nice services for visiting yachts. Also <span>Whittier, which has docking facilities and is connected to the road system.</span></span></p>
