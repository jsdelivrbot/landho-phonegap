<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../usa-pics/va_portsmouth_high-street-landing_sy-yindee-plus/@@images/image/preview"/>Historic Portsmouth is located on the western side of the Elizabeth River, in Hampton Roads, directly opposite from downtown Norfolk and conveniently positioned near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. </span></p>
<p><span>The vibrant downtown area has a long maritime history as a port city. The Olde Towne Business and Historical District is located in the downtown area, where a combination of preservation and redevelopment has created a picturesque downtown with all the amenities - including bars, restaurants, movie theatres, museums and shopping - that visiting sailors can ask for. </span></p>
<p><span>The city-long waterfront includes landscaped walking paths, the </span><em>Portsmouth</em><span> historic lightship and paddle-wheel ferries than run several times daily into downtown Norfolk.</span></p>
