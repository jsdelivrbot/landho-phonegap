<div class="hello"><div><p>This vibrant city, in its stunning setting, has an enormous range of marinas and moorings available. Seattle claims the highest number of boats per capita in the US, so finding marinas, yacht clubs and chandlers is an easy task, even on many of the smaller islands. Based as it is, on a series of islands, the water is an integral part of this city. It is also a convenient place from which to explore the amazing temperate rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula or the Mount St Helen's volcano.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts should be aware that Washington State law calls for a pilot aboard ALL non-US or Canadian yachts. An "exemption" from the Washington State Pilots
Commission is available at the cost of $300 for 90 days, or $500 for a
year. It appears that this ruling has been enforced haphazardly in the past but in 2007 one case was reported where a visiting yacht had to pay the waiver fee.</p>
