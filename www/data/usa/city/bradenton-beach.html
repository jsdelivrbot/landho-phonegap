<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Bradenton Beach is located between Tampa Bay and Sarasota on Anna Maria Island in Manatee County, Florida. Most yachting services are located on the protected Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). Whilst Bradenton Beach proper is located on the barrier island to the west, to the east a number of viable facilities for larger yachts can be found in neighboring Cortez, FL. The two towns are separated by a bridge.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Most marinas are directly accessible from the Intracoastal Waterway on both the barrier island and the mainland. Keep to the marked channels. As with other locations on the ICW, anchoring is possible anywhere outside of the channels.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Last updated September 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong><br/>An anchorage exists to the south of the city pier. There is good holding and relatively good protection. Dinghies may tie up on a floating dock at the pier and there are no fees for tying up here.</p>
<p>On the mainland side, across from the Bradenton Beach city pier, there is a second anchorage. This area is reported to suffer from continual wakes, so may be an uncomfortable place to anchor overnight.</p></div></div>
