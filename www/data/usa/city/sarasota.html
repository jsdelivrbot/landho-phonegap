<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several marinas, many accessed through locks.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong><br/> The 35 of the 109 planned moorings in the city's main anchorage are now in place. Maximum length 20m (60ft). Call ahead to reserve a mooring. Both long-term and short term rental is available. Berth at the fuel dock in Marina Jacks and report to the Harbour Master, who will allocate a mooring. After hours, tie to a free mooring and report in the morning. Free water taxi to the marina and access to the facilities there.<br/> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong><br/> Anchoring is only permitted 150 feet outside the mooring field or from any waterfront property. <span>The Bickel's Bayou mooring field however is exempt from this restriction and everybody can anchor there due to the private ownership status. </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Bickel's Bayou</strong> offers free anchoring to cruising sailors. The Ginsberg-Klemmts welcome all cruisers to use the anchorage, "but we can't guarantee that someone won't complain," warns owner Erika, who understands the anchoring rights issues all too well from their travels.
