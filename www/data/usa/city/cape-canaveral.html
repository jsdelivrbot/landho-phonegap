<div class="hello"><div><p>Cape Canaveral is a major cape in Brevard County, FL. The area is known as the Space Coast and is famous for being the home of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the Kennedy Space Center, the site of hundreds of rocket launches during the past 60 years. It is easily possible to see a rocket launch from anywhere in this area and cruisers report watching a launch from their deck while anchored or docked in one of the many nearby marinas.</p>
<p>Careful navigation is required in the inland waterways of Cape Canaveral. Cruisers regularly encounter manatee, dolphin, and other large marine animals. Also shoals and shallows are regularly found along the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). <span>There are three areas of land (mainland Florida, Merritt Island, Cape Canaveral) separated by two rivers (Banana River, Indian River). </span><span>The city of Cape Canaveral is situated on a barrier island that is seaward of the adjacent Merritt Island. Port Canaveral serves as the only inlet from the sea for 50 miles north or south. There is a lock separating the sea from the inland rivers. The ICW is located on the Indian River to the west and, though it looks wide, is often only a narrow channel in the middle of the shallow river.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are three areas of Cape Canaveral that host yachting facilities: the Port Canaveral basin, the barge canal (which links the Banana River and Indian River), and the Indian River (which is also the ICW).</p>
<p>When navigating in the Port Canaveral basin be aware that large ships, cruise ships, and military craft may be operating in the area with limited maneuverability or visibility. The port is active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Keep a close watch on VHF Channel 16 and Channel 12, the working channel of the Port Canaveral pilot boats.</p>
<p>For more information regarding the port operations of Port Canaveral, please visit: <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.portcanaveral.com/Cargo-Trade/Port-Operations">https://www.portcanaveral.com/Cargo-Trade/Port-Operations</a>.</strong></p>
<p><b>Anchorages</b>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vessels are not permitted to anchor in the Port Canaveral basin; however there are plenty of anchorages with good holding in the Banana River and Indian River (ICW) outside of the designated channel.</span></p>
<p>If visiting for a rocket launch, the closest anchorage is immediately north of the Port Canaveral lock. However, there is a security zone, which is <i>strictly enforced</i>. Obey all signs and channel markings. Rocket launches can be seen from all over the area, so Titusville on the Indian River might be a preferable option where anchorages are plentiful and facilities are nearby.</p>
