<div class="hello"><div><p>This huge bay offers a sailing area all of its own and, naturally a large number of options for berthing and anchoring. Be aware that the tidal stream  can reach over 5 knots under the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>San Francisco Yacht Harbour is to sta'bd once through the GG Bridge, also Gashouse Cove marina, Fisherman’s wharf and Pier 39 marinas. Clipper Yacht Harbor and Marina Plaza Harbor are just two of the many marinas at Sausalito, which is to port once through the Bridge.</p>
<p>Treasure Island Marina is directly across the bay at Berkeley, which is also the site of the huge Berkeley Marina and the yacht club. </p>
<p>China Basin is further into the Bay and to sta'bd, past the Oakland Bay Bridge and there are several marinas across the Bay around Alameda and Oakland. Oyster Cove &amp; Oyster Point marinas are in the southern part of the city.</p>
<p><b>Angel Island</b><br>
At Ayala Cove there is a large, new mooring field (as anchoring is no longer permitted here). The mooring balls are available for overnight use, and the docks for day use only. Rafting is allowed. The cove <b>requires</b> that boats tie bow and stern between two mooring balls (with bow toward Northeast) to use space efficiently and to avoid damage to the mooring
system.</br></p>
<p><b>China Cove</b><br>
This cove also offers an anchorage and often there will be three or four boats anchored near shore here, but there is little relief from the wakes of passing ships and ferries.</br></p>
<p><b>Berkeley</b><br>
Berkeley is across the Bay from the GG Bridge.</br></p>
<p>The Berkeley Yacht Club has guest dock along the east side of the building, with good protection from the prevailing westerly. Tie up if there's space. Reservations should be arranged via email with the Port Captain. If you don't have reservations for the guest dock, ring the doorbell on the front door to find the club manager or other club official who can confirm availability of the guest dock.</p>
<p>If the guest dock is full, the harbormaster's office is near the K dock gate, in the middle of the south side of the marina basin. There are usually plenty of transient berths available, but the office might be closed after about 6:30 PM. There is almost always plenty of space at the fuel dock across the channel on the north side, but you must be prepared to move when it opens in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Alcatraz Island</b><br>
Private boats aren't allowed to dock at Alcatraz.</br></p>

      Berkeley Yacht Club is on the south side of the entrance channel to the Berkeley Marina There is a guest dock, but the club does not provide permanent berthing. A prior reservation is advisable.<br>

Berkeley Yacht Club uses minimal professional staff. Bartenders are usually members, and when there is no bartender on duty the members are free to serve from the bar themselves. Members have keys to the club, and in contrast to many other yacht clubs that are closed during most of the week, BYC can be opened any time by members who wish to use the lounge, bar, or kitchen facilities. This makes the club particularly attractive to live-aboards, who often use these dining and socializing spaces in the clubhouse. This in turn has the effect of keeping the club socially active during the week, even when no events are planned and no groups are using the meeting rooms.

      This marina is located on the San Francisco waterfront, between the two bridges, below Coit tower. It  is right in the middle of it all. Buses, taxis, cable cars and trolley cars can get from here to anywhere. We are within walking distance of North Beach, Chinatown and the shopping districts.

Guest berthing is by reservation only. Same day reservations accepted, before 5pm. 

Pier 39 is also home to several hundred sea lions who moved in and took over the marina shortly after it was built. Being a protected species, and realizing the tourist attraction they became it didn't seem expedient to evict them from their new home.

      Berkeley Yacht Club is on the south side of the entrance channel to the Berkeley Marina There is a guest dock, but the club does not provide permanent berthing. A prior reservation is advisable.<br>

Berkeley Yacht Club uses minimal professional staff. Bartenders are usually members, and when there is no bartender on duty the members are free to serve from the bar themselves. Members have keys to the club, and in contrast to many other yacht clubs that are closed during most of the week, BYC can be opened any time by members who wish to use the lounge, bar, or kitchen facilities. This makes the club particularly attractive to live-aboards, who often use these dining and socializing spaces in the clubhouse. This in turn has the effect of keeping the club socially active during the week, even when no events are planned and no groups are using the meeting rooms.
