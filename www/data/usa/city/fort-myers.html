            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Fort Myers is a major tourist destination and a gateway to the Southwest Florida region. The city is located fifteen miles beyond an outer barrier island chain in a wide section of the Caloosahatchee River. Cape Coral, another large city, is located on the north bank of the river closer to the islands.</p>
<p>The Caloosahatchee River and the Fort Myers area is an important access point for the Okeechobee Waterway. The Okeechobee Waterway cuts directly across Florida from Fort Myers to Stuart, significantly shortening passage times <i>as long as the mast height does not exceed 54ft</i>. The inland waterway also bypasses the busiest areas (Miami or Ft. Lauderdale) and the navigationally complex Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Both <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and <span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">Henry Ford</a> had summer homes in the Fort Myers area and both are primary tourist attractions for the area. Sanibel Island is a beautiful and quiet vacation area.</span></p>
<p>Temperatures in the area rarely rise above 100ºF (38ºC) and it almost never freezes, but Fort Myers leads the United States in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.</p></div></div>
