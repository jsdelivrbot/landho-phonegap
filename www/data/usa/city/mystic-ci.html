<div class="hello"><div><p>Access to the Mystic river is from Long Island Sound and it provides several quiet and sheltered berths and anchorages. There are two lifting bridges on the river above West Mystic.</p>
<p>There are several marinas here, many of which are below the bridges.</p>
<p>The bascule bridge over the Mystic river is raised every hour at 20 minutes before the hour (07:40 - 19:40), except at 12:40</p>
<p>Noank is at the mouth of the Mystic river, just west of Mason's Island.</p>
