            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Located midway down the western coast of Florida, Tarpon Springs is known for its sponge fishing. Tourists are attracted to the display of the town's Greek heritage in the downtown area. The city says that by visiting Tarpon Springs it is possible to "visit Greece without leaving Florida."</p>
<p>When traveling on the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), Tarpon Springs and the Anclote River is at the end of a section. There is no ICW coverage for 150nm from Tarpon Springs to Carrabelle. Due to this, Tarpon Springs is a staging area for some yachts preparing to make the open water passages north to Carrabelle where the ICW resumes. Likewise, Tarpon Springs is a good arrival point having just made the open-water passages south.</p>
<p>It is not entirely necessary to do entire the passage at once: many yachts split the passage into multiple days and pause at Cedar Key or Crystal River, 60nm north and 45nm of Tarpon Springs, respectively. A cruiser favorite is the semi-hurricane hole at Crystal River where many facilities can be found and anchorages are plentiful. Regardless of the route, if traveling northbound from Tarpon Springs, cruisers will be spending time offshore and shore facilities are sparse.</p>
<p>It is relatively common for cruisers to stop in St. Petersburg or Gulfport (west St.Pete), and then stop in Tarpon Springs before making the long passage without the ICW.</p>
<p>The coast of Florida north of this area is marshy and often shallow. Deep-water harbours are essentially non-existent. Follow any channel markers carefully and watch your depth sounder. Some cruisers report taking extra time to make a safe approach and lead with their dinghy through shoals and bars.</p>
<p>Position <span>28°10'N, 082°49'W (off the entrance to the Anclote River).</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is not advisable to attempt to enter the Anclote River in the dark. The channel to the town is well marked.</p>
<p>The majority of the marinas here are aimed at motor cruisers or power yachts engaged in sport fishing; however, many facilities for sailing yachts do exist. <span>Tarpon Springs Municipal Marina and Turtle Bay Marina in downtown area are common options for cruisers.</span></p>
<p><span>There are anchorages outside the river but beware of the shallows. Do not anchor in the thoroughfare.</span></p>
