<div class="hello"><div><p>These remote, mostly uninhabited islands stretch across the Bering Sea. It is an area of stunning beauty,  magnificent views and also an absolute peace. It is either blowing a gale or there is complete calm. Very, very few yachts have visited these islands.</p>
<p>They stretch from Attu Island in the west, some 1200nm to Herbert Island in the east, just west of Umnak Island, Alaska.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/USA/Unalaska"><b>Dutch Harbour</b></a> on Unalaska is also part of the Aleutian Island chain but has not the remoteness of the islands to the west having all the trappings of western civilization.</p>
<p>Essential reading if planning to visit here is the RCC Pilotage Foundation guide, <strong>The Aleutian Islands and to SE  Alaska</strong> (2016). It can be downloaded free from the <a href="http://www.rccpf.org.uk/images/website_pdfs/e_pilots/Al%20and%20Alaska%20pm%202.pdf"><strong>RCCPF</strong></a> website.</p>
<p>Position 52° 42'N, 169° 42'W (Herbert Island)</p>
<p>Position 52° 43'N 172° 31'E (Attu Island)</p>
