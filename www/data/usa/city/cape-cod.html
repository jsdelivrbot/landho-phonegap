<div class="hello"><div><p>This long, curving peninsula provides interesting sailing areas both on the north and south shores. The eastern side is very inhospitable with no viable refuges.</p>
<p>The main ports on the southern side are Falmouth, Hyannis and South Yarmouth. On the northern and western coasts are the sheltered bays of Barnstable Harbor, Wellfleet Harbor, and at the north western tip of Cape Cod is Provincetown Harbor. This is the site of the historic landfall of the Mayflower and its excellent harbour is marked by the Pilgrim Monument.</p>
<p>Lying 30NM south of Cape Cod, are the islands forming the town of Nantucket; another popular holiday destination. Closer, just 5nm south from the south western tail of Cape Cod, is <b><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/USA/MarthasVineyard">Martha's Vinyard</a>.</b></p>
