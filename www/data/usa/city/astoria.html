<p><span>When entering the Columbia River you must go to the West End Mooring Basin to clear with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The West End Basin is located just before you go under the Astoria Megler Bridge and it is best if you go to the fuel dock just inside the basin. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Astoria has two marinas, both run by the Port Authority. The West Basin has more facilities and is busier than the East Basin, which is another mile and a half up the river.</p>
<p>Both marinas are less than a mile from historic downtown Astoria.</p>
<p>The currents in this powerful river can be very strong. If anchoring, take local advice on a suitable safe spot.</p>
