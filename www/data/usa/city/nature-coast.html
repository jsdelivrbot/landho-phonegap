<div class="hello"><div><p>Florida's "Nature Coast" is a 140nm stretch of coastline along the Gulf of Mexico. The 400,000 hectare stretch of land is home to nineteen endangered species. <span>The coast is low-lying mostly consisting of narrow rivers and estuaries that extend for many miles inland. The area appears remote and unspoiled by development. Some cruisers claim that it is reminiscent of a bygone era of cruising long before huge full-service marinas became prevalent.</span></p>
<p>There are four villages with varying levels of cruising facilities: Steinhatchee, Suwannee, Cedar Key, and Crystal River.</p>
<p>Cedar Key is a semi-offshore cluster of islands approximately 58nm from the mouth of the Anclote River (<a class="external-link" href="../TarponSprings/"><strong>Tarpon Springs</strong></a>). Crystal River is both a river and a town approximately 45nm north of Tarpon Springs. Suwannee is a village on the Suwannee River approximately 70nm north of Tarpon Springs. Steinhatchee (25nm north of Suwannee) is reported to be quite cruising yacht friendly although the dredging is controlled at only 5.5ft. All four are possible options for cruisers who do not wish to make the 150nm open-water passage from Tarpon Springs to Carrabelle, FL, though all three have their difficulties. This area is not serviced by the protected waters of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). Care must be exercised on all approaches and extreme shallows exist along the entire northwest coast.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an exceptionally low tide is known to occur in these areas, especially when a celestial low-tide occurs in conjunction with a strong easterly wind.</p>
<p>Crystal River is significantly more protected and "cruising friendly" than Cedar Key as there are no protected marinas for large yachts at Cedar Key. The Suwannee River is also reported to be inaccessible to deep-draught vessels of more than 4.5ft (at low-low tide). Similarly, Steinhatchee's approach channel and river is reported to be dredged at only 5.5ft. Cedar Key does offer one of the only possible stops along the relatively inaccessible west coast of Florida that is not situated on a river. If you are cruising the coast of Florida and you wish to cut the "big" jump outside the ICW down by at least one-third, a stop at Crystal River is a solid option for almost any cruising yacht.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Steinhatchee River access is well marked and dredged to at least 5.5ft. The channel is at least 50ft wide. Careful pilotage is required, but many cruisers report extremely pleasant stays in Steinhatchee.</p>
<p>Suwannee River access is difficult but possible. Shoal draught (4.5ft or less) ideal.</p>
<p>Cedar Key dockage for yachts is essentially non-existent. The anchorage in the area off the Cedar Key Fishing Pier is commonly used by cruisers who then dinghy in. The Fishing Pier is built far too high to tie up to. Dinghy's may be tied up at many places along the Cedar Key waterfront. There is an inner harbour accessible only to very small boats, which can only be entered at high tide: at low tide, the harbour dries out. (<span>Cedar Key Marina II is reported not approachable by deep-draught vessels of any kind.)</span></p>
<p>Dockage, marinas, and anchorages on the Crystal River and the City of Crystal River are readily available. If the docks seem too small for a cruising yacht, simply anchor off and dinghy in. The area is very cruiser-friendly.</p>
