<div class="hello"><div><p>The area around Naples, Florida, is famous for high-end shopping, golf courses, fishing, and dolphin-sightings. It is one of the wealthiest cities in the United States with the second highest proportion of millionaires per capita. Real estate is also some of the most expensive in the country.</p>
<p>This high proportion of wealth means that the area is dotted with numerous marinas and yacht clubs. But do not be put-off by the idea that dockage may be equally expensive: at most Naples marinas prices are comparable with elsewhere on the Gulf Coast of Florida.</p>
