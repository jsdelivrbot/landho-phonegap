<div class="hello"><div><p>The city of Unalaska is situated on the northern end of Unalaska Island, the second largest island in the Aleutian Chain. Its huge variety of wildlife includes marine mammals, large populations of seabirds, songbirds, some migrating Asiatic species and waterfowl. It also has the oldest Russian Orthodox Cathedral in the USA, which has recently been restored.</p>
<p>Dutch Harbour in the city of Unalaska is the biggest fishing port in the US. Consequently services are plentiful.</p>
<p>Position 53° 53'N, 166° 31'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the first port of entry if coming from Japan along the Aleutian Islands. The best way to get hold of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is to call the Harbour Master on channel 16. The Harbour Master will ask you to switch to 14, and after getting the details of the boat, will notify CBP.</p>
<p>You will be told how to proceed from there. The service is very cordial and friendly in this part of America. Depending on where you are from, a cruising permit for the US may be issued in Dutch Harbour. You will be required to notify Homeland Security by telephone or email as you go on.</p>
<p>Note also that there is some confusion as to the need to give notice in advance. This may or may not apply to small vessels, but 96 hours advance notice would never hurt.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very busy harbour and space is at a premium. Iliuliuk Harbour is likely to be the best place as the commercial harbour does not have berths suitable for yachts. The Harbour master will advise.</p>
