<div class="hello"><div><p>The Tampa Bay area is an enormous metropolitan area surrounding a large bay. The Tampa Bay area encompasses the dominant cities of Tampa and St. Petersburg (St. Pete) as well as all of the outlying suburbs and intermediate towns. St. Petersburg occupies the peninsula to seaward with all its associated neighborhoods including Clearwater, Largo, Pinellas Park, Gulfport, and the outer barrier islands. Tampa occupies the inland area.</p>
<p>To the south, <a class="external-link" href="../BradentonBeach">Bradenton</a> is a major yachting centre and separates the Tampa Bay area from the Sarasota Bay. The well-known Longboat Key is the outer barrier island that separates <a class="external-link" href="../Sarasota">Sarasota</a> from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Like the Atlantic coast, this area also is served by a well-traveled Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), a unique system of navigable channels, rivers, and canals on the inside of the barrier island chain. The ICW enters Tampa Bay and passes through Boca Ciega on its way north. If you are traveling via the ICW, Tampa and downtown St. Pete will be somewhat out of the way: Gulfport has many yachting facilities in a protected bay. St.Pete and Tampa, on the other hand, have almost ever feasible repair service, fabrication facility, and marina amenity possible.</p>
<p>The main body of Tampa Bay is deep enough for any cruising vessels; however, there are areas of shoaling and spoil areas from dredging. This is especially true outside of the ICW channel. Keep to the markers and do not cut corners.</p>
<p>A number of wildlife refuges and state parks are scattered around this area. Be aware that there are local laws that may limit fishing or other resource usage in these areas. Follow all posted signs or notice boards. The area is patrolled by Park Rangers who enforce the laws in these areas.</p>
<p>To pinpoint the location of each marina in this listing, refer to the address: each address specifies the neighborhood in which the marina/boatyard is located.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The City of St.Pete has installed mooring balls in its North Basin (also known as the Vinoy Basin). Approximate position: 27º46'N - 082º37'W. Anchoring there is no longer possible nor legal. Cruisers who want to visit downtown St. Petersburg by boat will have little choice but to pick up a mooring or rent a slip, since there's no other safe anchorage near downtown St.Pete.</p>
<p>Anchorages are few and far between in the Tampa Bay area. The bay is so large that wind fetch can cause the sea to pile up and act like an inland sea in severe weather.</p>
<p>For anchorages, look for enclosed bays on the chart. Similar to elsewhere in Florida, there are anchoring restrictions near permanent structures and a certain distance from private property. The area near bridges are often viable, but a wind shift might easily make the anchorage untenable.</p>
<p>There is some reported success in the area near Gulfport and on the west of St.Pete peninsula along the ICW. Cruisers who frequent this area report holding is moderate to good in most places with typical amounts of snags. Avoid anchoring near permanent mooring fields due to the increased amount of junk on the seafloor.</p>
