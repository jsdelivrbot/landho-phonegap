<div><p>Stanley is the only Port of Entry for yachts. Advise the Authorities of the yacht's ETA on VHF channel 16. <span>Fly the "Q" flag.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are no cruise ship tenders using it, go alongside at the Public Jetty. Alternatively, berth at FIPASS, (the commercial dock) which is very dirty so if you have delicate decks don't go there. </span></p>
<p><span>If cruise ship tenders are using the Public Jetty pontoons you won't be allowed there until the ship leaves (which is usually about five pm). It may also be possible to dock alongside the Falkland Islands Company (FIC) jetty - call 'Fleetwing' on VHF channel 16 or 9. </span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively anchor off and speak to 'Stanley Customs' on VHF 12 or 16 to arrange where and when to do the paperwork.</span></p>
<p>One Government Official deals with both Immigration and Customs clearance.</p>
<p>On departure, yachts must leave from Stanley.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yachts Planning to Visit Antarctica</span></strong></p>
<p>Any yachts leaving The Falkland (or any other British Territory) for the Antarctica with at least one British national on board are able to apply for a permit from the U.K. Foreign Office. This can also be done even if the yacht is not U.K. flagged. See <a href="http://www.highlatitudes.com/antarctic-yachting-guidelines.pdf"><strong>www.highlatitudes.com/antarctic-yachting-guidelines.pdf</strong> </a> for more information as well as useful data about sailing in Antarctica. There are forms tailored to expeditions by smaller yachts. The permit forms required are now found at <a href="www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit#applying-for-a-permit"><strong>www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit</strong></a></p>
<p><i>(NOTE: The links in www.hightlatitudes.com page to these forms are out of date (still true in August 2015) as the FCO website was changed in May 2013)</i></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cruising between Argentina and the Falklands</span></strong></p>
<p>The procedure which currently works and enables yachts to pass from Falklands to Argentina and back again, without difficulty, is to apply for a "Permiso" from Argentina 7-10 days in advance of setting off towards the islands.</p>
<p>This permit is needed by ships and all sailing vessels using Argentine waters en-route to the Falklands, South Georgia or the South Sandwich Islands - all UK controlled. This is being <span>aggressively </span><span>policed and large fines are made for those making unscheduled stops, even in an emergency. For example, two private yachts in the last 2 months of 2010 were fined $6000 US for visiting the Falklands without Argentine permission. In both cases force Majeure was claimed (engine problems/weather) however this was not considered an issue when being assessed for the fines.</span></p>
<p>For information on how to apply for a "permiso" read report <a href="Members/sue/R2012-04-26-3"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The latest condition being applied by Argentina, is the requirement that, even if not calling at the Falklands, the skipper of yachts sailing to of from an Argentinian port via the Atlantic, must complete a form Anexo 2 where the skipper makes a sworn statement in the presence of an Argentine consul or a coastguard officer, not to visit the Falkland Islands. If this form is not completed nor permission obtained to visit the islands, it is assumed they have done so and a fine imposed.</p>

<div><p><strong>Minefields</strong><br/> These are left from the 1982 war with Argentina, but are clearly marked and fenced off giving protection from wandering into danger from the land. However they tend not to be fenced from approach from seaward, so care should be taken and a map purchased should you intend to anchor and land.</p>
<p>These are mainly areas around Stanley, Port Howard, Fox Bay and Fitzroy. A map of the mined areas can be obtained from the Army office in Stanley.</p>
