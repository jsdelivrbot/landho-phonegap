<div class="hello"><div><p>Both the Customs &amp; Immigration Department and Harbour Authorities require at least 24 hours notice of any vessel's arrival, except in an emergency. This information can be passed by your agent or representative in Stanley.</p>
<p>Stanley is the only Port of Entry to and from the islands.</p>
<p><span>Any vessel entering or leaving the port MUST report via VHF channel 10 or 16 before crossing the reporting line. The Reporting Line is a line joining the positions 51° 31'S 57° 44'W (Volunteer Point) and 51° 41'S 57° 43'W (Cape Pembroke). This line forms the outer limit of Berkeley Sound and Port William.</span></p>
<p>Boats can go alongside the Public Jetty if checking in and the cruise ship tenders are not using it, or there are mooring buoys between the Public Jetty and the Government Jetty.</p>
<p>If it is too rough, anchor off and you will receive a visit by launch. The most sheltered spot from all directions except the east is just past the butchery where you can use the beach (covered at high tide) or the slipway to land a dinghy.</p>
