            </h2>
<div><p>Except if arriving in an emergency, it is necessary to appoint an agent in advance of arrival.</p>
<p>Yachts usually clear in and out at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Male">Malé</a></strong>, although now <strong><a class="external-link" href="Uligamu">Uligamu</a></strong> in Haa Alifu Atoll and <strong><a class="external-link" href="Gan">Gan</a></strong> in Addu Atoll are also Ports of Entry. <span>Uligamu is proving to be a popular port at which to clear in and the officials there are friendly and helpful, plus the last report we received by a boat clearing in here is that it is <span>$100 cheaper to enter via Uligamu than Male</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Stays of less than 48 hours:</strong><br/> Yachts can stay up-to<strong> 48 hours</strong> at the arrival Port of Entry <strong>without appointing an agent</strong>. But the vessel must get clearance within 24 hours of arrival and clear out within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Customs fees are payable for inward and outward clearance and a small entry fee to the Port Authority, however a Clearance Permit fee is not charged. See<strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees"> Fees</a></strong> for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Stays of more than 48 hours:</strong><br/> If staying longer in the Maldives, all vessels must appoint an agent within 48 hours of arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Stays of less than 7 days:</strong><br/> If is now no longer necessary to purchase a Cruising Permit if staying less than 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Staying 7 days or longer:</strong><br/> It is important that if you plan to stay 7 days or more, then your application for a Cruising Permit must reach the Ministry of Tourism <strong>within 84 hours</strong> of your Inward Clearance (this excludes Public holidays). If this is not done, then your agent can be fined.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with your Agent</strong><br/> The agent's fee can be anything upward of US$75, although it varies depending on the agent and it is definitely worth shopping around and negotiating the fees to be paid in advance of arrival. There are a number of legitimate agents in the Maldives, see <a href="?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>here</strong></a><span> for a list. <span>Check that any agent used is registered with the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture and it is definitely worth asking around first as to which agents other cruisers recommend.</span></span></p>
<p>When an agent has been prearranged, he should be notified 48 hours before arrival of the ETA. An ETA letter will then be sent by the agent to the Ministry of Defence and National Security, Customs, Port Authority, Immigration and Quarantine. The details of the ETA letter include the following particulars:</p>
<ol>
<li>Name of vessel</li>
<li>Name of master and nationality</li>
<li>Name of owner</li>
<li>Port of registration and official number</li>
<li>Gross tonnage</li>
<li>Callsign</li>
<li>HF working frequency</li>
<li>Last port of call</li>
<li>Estimated date and time of arrival</li>
<li>Number of crew</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cruising Permit </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>Tourism Fee</strong><span>) - Amendment February 2014</span></p>
<p><span> </span>The requirement for this fee, introduced 1st June 2010, refers to a Foreign Tourist Vessel 'cruising' and harbouring' in the Maldives. If staying less than 7 days, then a permit is not required. If staying longer, then the permit must be applied for within 84 hours of clearing in.<br/> It costs US$325 (MVR 5,000) and is valid for the length of the stay (maximum 180 days).</p>
<p>Payment must be made to the <span>Ministry of Tourism Arts &amp; Culture in Male. If clearing in at another port the Agent can help with this payment for an extra charge.</span></p>
<p>The cruising permit will list the atolls for which permission has been granted for a visit. An agent can arrange this. Yachts not obtaining permission are liable to be fined a substantial amount. Without this permit, a yacht must remain in the arrival anchorage.</p>
<p>See the original <strong> <a href="http://www.tourism.gov.mv/downloads/vessel_regulations/Foreign_Vessel_Regulation_eng.pdf">Ministry of Tourism text</a></strong> and the <a href="maldives-welcome-amendments-to-the-rules-for-visiting-yachts"><strong>Feb 2014 amendment</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If wishing to have guests on board, then a <strong>charter licence</strong> must be purchased as well as payment of the Tourism fee.<br/> See <strong><a href="?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a> </strong>for the costs involved.</p>
<p>Be prepared to pay all fees in cash.</p>
