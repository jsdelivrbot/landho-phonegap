<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="Countries/Maldives/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Maldives/Clearance</strong></a> for the latest information on clearance into the Maldives and permits.</p>
<p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Maldives/Gan/Countries/Maldives?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Maldives Clearance Agents</a></strong><span> for a list of agents in Male.</span></p>
<p><span>Vessels are not allowed to enter Malé between 23:00 and 06:00 except with special permission from the Coastguard. The Port Authority now insists that all vessels, regardless of size, need to have a pilot, although this is not strictly applied.</span></p>
<p>An hour before arrival, the Coastguard should be contacted on Channel 10 or 16 (24 hours), who will first ask if the vessel has an agent. If not, the vessel's particulars will be passed on to the Port Authority before the boat is allowed to proceed.</p>
<p><span>In practice it is more likely that an agent will answer the VHF call not the Coastguard or Port Control. It is recommended to contact your prefered agent in advance to avoid confusion. <span>See </span><a href="Countries/Maldives?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Male/Clearance Agents</strong></a><span> </span><span>for a list of agents able to deal with clearance formalities.</span></span></p>
<p>Anchoring in Malé atoll itself is difficult because of depth. A patch with a minimum depth of 50 ft (15 m) is reported at 4°10.40'N 73°29.80'E. If this place is occupied, one must be prepared to anchor nearby in depths of around 150 ft (50 m).</p>
<p>It might be possible to arrange in advance with an agent to go directly to the anchorage in the lagoon north of the airport, at Hulhumale; the agent will arrange for the officials to visit you there, but this should be confirmed with the agent before actually going there as reports are that clearance is not always permitted there. You will have to pay for their transport out there - so the cost should be ascertained in advance. <i>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Maldives/clearing-into-the-maldives-at-male">cruisers report</a></strong> dated March 2015 on this subject.</i></p>
<p><span>The Coastguard must inspect the yacht and provide clearance before any of the other officials. No one must go ashore until clearance is completed. Customs, Immigration and Health will board during office hours to carry out the rest of the clearance. Note that Sunday is classed as a working day in the Maldives.</span></p>
<p>On departure, first clear Immigration, then the  Port Authority and finally Customs. This can take some time.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Hulhumale</strong></p>
<p><span>As a consequence of an ambitious land reclamation project, the lagoon next to the airport has been dredged to a depth of about 12 metres. The entrance to the lagoon has also been deepened and widened, and is located just north of the end of the airport runway at 04°12.766N, 073°31.754E. </span></p>
<p><span>The entrance is well marked, although it is not yet showing on the charts. Reports from March 2015 are that t<span>he entrance depth is approx. 21 feet minimum and the water depth elsewhere approx. 35 feet.</span></span></p>
<p><span>This anchorage is very protected with excellent holding and ferries run regularly to Malé, a trip of about twenty minutes.</span><span> There is however </span><span>a fair amount of aircraft and construction noise.</span></p>
<p><span>Hulhumale anchorage does not have a safe dinghy dock. There is a jetty made of sheet piling with a concrete cap from which extend two docks with steps that are in constant use with passengers loading and unloading every few minutes. </span></p>
<p>A ten minute walk from the jetty are shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>Anchoring fees in 2015 in Male were approx. $60 for one month, $212 for two months.</p>
<p>A <span>300 berth Yacht Marina (<span>Hulhumalé Yacht Marina)</span> and Cruise Ship port is planned here.</span></p>
