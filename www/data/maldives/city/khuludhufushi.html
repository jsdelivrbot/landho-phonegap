<p>This is a Port of Entry, however not one that is used to clearing pleasure yachts. Whilst all foreign yachts can get inward and outward clearance here, prices are likely to be higher.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not a busy port and so a comfortable berth for yachts.</p>
<p>There is a fee of US$12 for a 24 hour stay in the port and it is possible to fill up with water there for a small fee.</p>
<p>The town of Khuludhufushi has quite a few shops with basic provisioning and some restaurants. A café on the main street has Wi Fi, however electricity here can be variable.</p>
