<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Maldives?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Maldives Clearance</a></strong> for main clearance information.</p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Maldives?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Maldives Clearance Agents</a></strong> for a list of agents in Gan.</p>
<p>Yachts are most welcome and can both clear in and out here. Fees may be less than at Malé.</p>
<p>Contact the authorities on VHF Ch 10 or 16 on arrival and follow instructions as they will probably insist you go to the designated anchorage in the inner harbour. Customs and immigration will visit the boat and will keep clearance from Malé if one has already cleared out of the country. It may be necessary to complete clearing-out formalities again before departure.</p>
<p>Clearing in and out will involve a trip to Hithadhoo (about 10NM from Gan). Phone in advance as the official is not always there. Then return to Gan to complete the process.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Maldives?rc=Formalities#Fees">Clearance fees</a></strong> and an entry fee must be paid to <span>Hithadhoo Ports Limited located at the main road in front of the Regional Port. Their counter is downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span>If this is your first port of entry in the Maldives and you are staying more than 48 hours, an agent must be appointed to deal with the cruising permit paperwork. They will also assist with payment for the cruising permit to the <span>Ministry of Tourism Arts &amp; Culture in Male.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>One can anchor in the inner harbour at Gan, where there is now only 2.5 metres at the entrance and about 5 metres inside. It only has room for about 6 yachts, and is also subject to flies and mosquitoes. The outer harbour is deeper, ranging from 15 to 25m, but the holding is generally good in sand and weed. Insects are not a problem here.</p>
<p>There is now a new harbour at Hithadhoo. It appears it will provide a well protected anchorage in sand.</p>
