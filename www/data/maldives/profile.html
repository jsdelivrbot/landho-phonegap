                Facts
                
                
            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>There is a lack of all-weather anchorages and in most lagoons the anchorages are very deep and exposed, so islands such as Thulusdhoo and Himmafushi are popular because they have shallow well-protected anchorages. Many of the comunities have now improved the marking of their lagoon entrances, and in some cases, deepened them.</li>
<li>In addition, many of the good anchorages are part of resorts, who tend not to welcome yachts or charge a high fee for anchoring and landing.</li>
<li>There are repair facilities on Malé and also on Addu Atoll.</li>
<li>As a convenient stop-over for yachts bound for either the Red Sea, or enroute via the Cape of Good Hope, Uligamu, in the northern part of the archipelago, is a useful Port of Entry. Basic provisions can be found here, although fuel can be difficult to find. Male is better for both. </li>
<li>The building of a deep-water marina on Dhonakulhi island has enhanced the facilities in the Northern Maldives.</li>
<li>The Maldives government generally regards land-based resort visitors as making a more valuable contribution to their tourist industry, consequently the fees for yachts, even if making a brief stop, are high. From November 1st 2014 the government "Tourist Goods and Services Tax" (TGST), introduced in 2011, has risen again and is now 12%. This is implemented on all goods and services provided to tourists by resorts and tourist related establishments.</li>

            </h2>
<div><p>It seems that pirates operating around the Gulf of Aden have indeed moved their area of operation to the waters around the Maldives. Due to the ability of the attacks to be launched from "mother ships" far from any shore, larger and larger areas of the Northern Indian Ocean must be regarded as potentially unsafe.</p>
<p>That said, the increase in military in the area has seen a decline in attacks and c<span>ruisers have reported that there is no problem with security in the anchorages around the islands. </span></p>
<p><span>There are occasional disturbances in Male during which time it is wise to keep away from the town.</span></p>
