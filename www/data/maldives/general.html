<div><p>International Dialing Code for Maldives is +960.<br/></p>
<p>Mobile phone: Roaming agreements exist with most international mobile phone companies. Coverage is decent throughout the islands, though as the country is so spead out, there are still some blindspots. It’s possible to buy a local SIM card in Malé to make cheap local calls.<br/></p>
<p>Internet: The Internet can be accessed from most areas of the Maldives. Malé, the capital, has a lack of Internet cafés, but Wi-Fi is available in many other cafés. Almost all resorts have Internet connections via terminals for guest use or wireless, though these are rarely free.</p>
