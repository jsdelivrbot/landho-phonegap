<p>The government boat carrying the officials will not take crews ashore, who must use their dinghy. In the event of a medical emergency a boat will be provided. </p>
<p>The small boat harbour closes to visiting vessels after 1900 in the summer (October-March), and 1700 in winter (April-September), though it may also be closed to visitors during early mornings and late afternoons on fishing days or in the event of bad weather.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>All visiting vessels should seek advice from the Harbourmaster on a safe anchorage position in the open anchorage below the Settlement. This anchorage is open to the north and depths range from 50m to 100m.</p>
<p>Visiting vessels are expected to use their own boats, if suitable, for use in landing in the shallow boat harbour. Otherwise a local small dinghy (£75) can be hired by a visiting yacht.</p>
<p>After landing, lift the dinghy ashore and ask advice on where it should be left.</p>
