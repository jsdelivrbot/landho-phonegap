<div><ul>
<li>Tristan da Cunha is part of the British Overseas Territory called St. Helena &amp; Dependencies. Along with <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/AscensionIsland"><b>Ascension</b></a>, it is under the authority of the Governor of <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/StHelena"><b>St Helena</b></a> but powers are delegated to a resident Administrator. Other islands nearby are the small, uninhabited Inaccessible, Nightingale, Middle and Stoltenhoff Islands. A weather station is located on Gough Island and manned by a few personnel.</li>
<li>Tristan da Cunha is almost circular, the core of a volcano with steep cliffs plunging into the sea. On the north-west corner is a small habitable plateau, and the settlement of Edinburgh. It is home to less than 300 people.</li>
<li>The anchorage is completely unprotected and a heavy swell is constant, worst in a north-westerly. The small boat harbour has only about 3 ft (91 cm) of water and a heavy surge from the constant swell. Yachts can rarely stay for very long, even if they want to. The best time to visit is in January to March when the chances of actually being able to land is highest. Yet in spite of all the difficulties, every year this remote community is visited by a few intrepid yachts. </li>
<li>The islanders are very adept at all kinds of repairs and have helped yachts in the past. The Government workshop may be able to help with repairs.</li>
