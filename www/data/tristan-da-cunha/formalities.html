<div><p>It is important to give the island as much advance warning of your arrival as possible. Every effort should be made to avoid arriving at a weekend. It is essential to read <a href="http://www.tristandc.com/visitsships.php"><strong>Advice for Visiting Yachts</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Advance arrangements may be made by contacting the Police Departments at +44 (0)20 3014 2010, Fax +44(0)20 3014 2020 or email <a href="mailto:tristandcpolice@gmail.com"><strong>tristandcpolice@gmail.com</strong></a></p>
<p><span>On approaching the island, contact Tristan Radio via VHF Channel 14, 16 or 78, or HFSSB 4000 / 4149 / 6230 / 8294mhz  to advise of ETA.</span></p>
<p>Contact Communications Officer Andy Repetto Tristan Radio ZOE at e-mail <a href="mailto:tristanradiozoe@yahoo.co.uk"><strong>tristanradiozoe@yahoo.co.uk</strong></a> or by phone on +44 (0) 20 3014 2034 or after hours +44 (0) 20 3014 5024</p>
<p>Government of the island closes at 15:00 on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday, so if arriving at the weekend, it will be necessary to wait until the start of the week to clear in.</p>
<p>Clearance must be obtained from the Harbourmaster, Medical Officer and Immigration Officer before anchoring or disembarking passengers or crew and advice must be obtained regarding a safe anchorage position. The Visits Liaison Officer will arrange for officials to visit the boat. Immigration is completed ashore.</p>
<p><span>Yachts should maintain contact with Tristan Radio while at the anchorage, and inform them of ETD (estimated time of departure) and destination.</span></p>
<p>No person may land at Nightingale, Alex or Stoltenhoff Islands without first clearing at Tristan and then obtaining permission from the Administrator.</p>
