<ul>
<li>On the south-eastern coast of China, Macau consists of the peninsula on which the city of Macau is built, and the islands of Taipa and Coloane in the Pearl River delta. After nearly five centuries under Portuguese administration, Macau reverted to China at the end of 1999.</li>
<li>Similar to Hong Kong, the government in Beijing has guaranteed the unimpeded continuation of Macau's status as a centre for international commerce. The town is a fascinating mixture of old colonial styles and Chinese and as it has retained more of its old character, it is more interesting to visit than neighbouring Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Repair facilities are available at a government workshop in the port area, which also has a slipway. However, because of the proximity of Hong Kong, it is preferable to use the better facilities available there. Provisioning is good, although the selection is not as wide as in Hong Kong.</li>
