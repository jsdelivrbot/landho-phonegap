<div><p>Marine Police should be contacted on Channel 16 who may allow a yacht to use their own basin in the inner harbour, which has a depth of 9 ft (2.70 m). Otherwise one should be prepared to anchor in the river, which can be quite uncomfortable and should only be used in settled weather.</p>
<p>The outer harbour is used mainly by ferries and hydrofoils going to Hong Kong. If the yacht is not visited by officials the captain should go to the harbour master's office with the ship's papers.</p>
<p>On departure, the harbour master should be notified not later than six hours before departure.</p>
