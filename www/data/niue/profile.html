<div><ul>
<li>The island of Niue is one of the world's smallest states, but the largest block of coral. Niue boasts amazing caves both under the ground and the sea and the diving here is excellent.</li>
<li>Lying on the direct route from French Polynesia to Vava'u in Tonga, Niue is a favourite stop for westbound yachts.</li>
<li>The anchorage is off the island's west coast, close to the main settlement at Alofi. Although the anchorage offers good protection from the prevailing SE winds, in westerly winds the island is a deadly lee shore and one must always keep an eye on the weather, particularly when visiting ashore.</li>
<li>Take care on the approach to Alofi Bay as there are two Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) as you enter the bay. These are unlit. For more details see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Niue/Alofi/">Alofi</a></b>.</li>
<li>Provisioning: The island has a small store with basic provisions and frozen meats. The amount of stock will depend on shipments to the island.</li>
