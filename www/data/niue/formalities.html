<div><p>A 24 hour service is provided by Telecom Niue contactable on VHF channel 16 (Niue Radio) and on SSB as "ZKN Niue Radio" on 2162Mhz</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: <span>Nuie Radio on 6125Mhz is no longer monitored.</span></p>
<p>When yachts are about 10 nm's out they <strong>MUST</strong> contact Niue Radio on VHF Channel 16 who will take down your details. This will allow time to contact the officials needed. Please wait for a response from Niue Radio about clearance times. You must wait on your vessel until clearance is arranged.</p>
<p>Niue is free from most of the world's major pests and diseases and are most anxious to keep it that way. All animals, food stuff, fruit, vegetables, plants and garbage must be secured until clearance has been granted.</p>
<p>Niue Radio will contact Customs and make arrangements for you to “clear” . <strong>Please wait on board for instructions before attempting to come ashore as Niue Customs are very strict about this.</strong></p>
<p>Immigration, Customs, Agriculture and Port Authorities are available for clearance from 9am – 4pm Monday to Friday, Saturday clearance can usually be arranged. Sunday clearance for emergencies only, is a possibility. Clearance MUST be gained before coming ashore on Niue.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>It is important that you arrive here with adequate clearance papers from French Polynesia (if having stopped there en-route). Failing to do so will result in a fine <span>of $NZ200 or $US175.</span></p>
<p>Call "NIUE YACHT CLUB" on VHF Ch 16, then change to Channel 10 for mooring advice and other help. See<strong> <a href="Countries/Niue/Alofi">Docking</a></strong> for further information.</p>
<p>The yacht club has some very useful advice on their <a class="external-link" href="http://nyc.nu/wp/arrival-info"><strong>Arrival Information</strong></a> page. The NYC Help desk (<a href="mailto:support@nyc.nu">support@nyc.nu</a>) will also responded to promptly to requests for additional information.</p>
<p>A Government departure tax is payable on clearance (see <a href="Countries/Niue/?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a>).</p>

<div><p>Certain shell species are protected and the taking of shells using scuba gear is prohibited. During the year certain areas are closed to spearfishing and swimming, to protect breeding or migratory fish. The tourist office will have up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Niue is a marine sanctuary for the protection of whales and there are strict regulations covering any interaction with them. Often they will be found in the mooring field. Under no circumstances approach them in your tenders. During the the peak of the season when humpback whales are visiting  (August/September) visitors are requested to observe a 30 metre exclusion zone around the whales with their tenders and yachts so that the humpbacks can rest, and feed their young undisturbed.</p></div>
