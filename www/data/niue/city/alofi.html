<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/niue-pics/niue_mooring-field_nyc/@@images/image/preview"/>Alofi is the capital of Niue and consists of the two villages: Alofi North and Alofi South where the government headquarters are located. <span>It is located at the centre of </span>Alofi Bay<span> on the west coast of the island, close to the only break in the </span>coral reef<span> that surrounds Niue. The bay stretches for 30% of the island's length (about seven kilometres) from </span>Halagigie Point<span> in the south to Makapu Point in the north.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Potential Navigation Hazard</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Approaching Niue there are two FAD positions for Alofi Bay. These fish aggregation rafts are lying low in the water and are unmarked. They are  moored in 300 metres of water and while the GPS location is for the concrete attachment blocks below, the rafts swing on a wider arc than these marked positions.  Please be aware of these FADs as there are no other impediments to your safe arrival to Niue.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p>Although there are navigation lights marked on most charts, <i><strong>some of these north and south of the wharf approach</strong></i> have not been repaired after Cyclone Heta damage. There are two red leading lights that indicate the approach to the wharf and two bright white lights illuminating the wharf area after dark which can be seen for a distance seaward.</p>
<p>See notes above about the FADs in Alofil Bay which should be avoided.</p>
<p>It is advisable to approach in daylight and, if possible, to use radar to establish distance off. Provisions have been made for a night approach - see below - however the FADs are not lit. Depth soundings will offer no help due to the steep-to nature of the coast.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://nyc.nu/wp/mooring-aerial-images" target="_blank">Niue Yacht Club website</a></strong> has some useful aerial photographs of the mooring field, anchorage and wharf.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> Anchoring is discouraged because of the seabed topography where anchors can get into crevices etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><span>Currently  the Yacht Club is down to 17 moorings (from 20) because of storm damage in the seabed block area (see news item adjacent). </span><span>During rally visits there is limited availability. Whilst advance booking is not possible, it's worth contacting the NYC in advance of your arrival to check no big fleets are due in.</span></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Moorings are available at $20NZ per night - the first price increase in 7 seasons</span>. <span>All moorings for Niue Yacht club are regularly inspected and photographed. </span>The moorings are approx 5 ton concrete blocks with polyester lines and pink pick-up floats. Pass your rope through the stainless steel eye, tie off on board and put the float back in the water. The moorings are checked regularly. Note that the far north mooring is a privately owned mooring for a local fisherman and is not available for yacht use.</p>
<p>All mooring buoys have reflectorized tape on the pick-up float to ensure easier mooring in the dark.</p>
<p>All mooring lines and buoys are removed in early November prior to the cyclone season.</p>
<p>There is also a large Niue Fisheries mooring available all year round that is designed for very large yachts.  A $25 per night fee is payable to the Niue Fisheries Department</p>
<p>Contact Niue Yacht Club on Channel 16 (monitored throughout the day) for mooring allocation. You will be asked to go to CH 10 by their operator. Niue Radio also monitor these calls.</p>
<p>Niue is the base for a Sailmail station.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/9a15cb9d97494644a949c1f1e7d3a396/@@images/image/preview"/><span></span>Getting Ashore</strong><br/> Landing with your dinghy can be an interesting experience as there is no beach, just a concrete jetty/wharf <i>(see view from the wharf camera adjacent showing the southern mooring buoys and winch for tenders)</i>. Your  tender must be lifted out by the dock crane onto the wharf, where there is a trolley for moving it clear of the landing zone.  You will need a 3 point bridle for your dinghy.</p>
