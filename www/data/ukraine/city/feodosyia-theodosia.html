<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour is open the the north and northeast but offers good shelter in winds from other directions.</p>
<p>There appears to be room to anchor here and the holding is good, however a stern line ashore may be required. Otherwise berth to the east pier or where directed.</p>
<p>This is a state owned port and therefore charges, if any, are cheap.</p>
<p>It may be possible for fuel and water to be delivered.</p>
<p>Basic provisons can be obtained in the town. Some repairs are possible and there is a mobile crane.</p>
