<div class="hello"><div><p>Yalta nestles inside a deep bay on the North coast of the Black Sea, surrounded by mountains covered in woods, vineyards and orchards. As the Crimea’s most important Black Sea resort, the port is a magnet for cruise ships and superyachts of all types and is a hive of activity.</p>
<p>Yalta has 2 Blue Flag beaches and a beautiful waterfront, where locals and tourists gather to be seen.</p>
<p>There are no facilities for yachts here. </p>
<p>Position 44°29.4’N. 34°10.3’E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The main Passenger Port is open to the south, and with an onshore wind, conditions can become untenable. Local officials warn that Yalta is no place to be in a Southerly. Yachts should med-moor with own anchor on the NW quay. This harbour is reported to be crowded, with no security or services, noisy and expensive (US$50 a night in 2009).</p>
<p>The commercial harbour (Massandra) to the East, is reported to be empty, clean and cheap. It is not close to the town but taxis are very reasonable. It may be possible to obtain permission from Port Control to move there.</p>
<p>Yalta has good shops for provisioning and a market.</p>
