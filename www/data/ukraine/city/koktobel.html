<div class="hello"><div><p>Koktebel is a small resort town (2.500 people) on the Black Sea nestled at the base of the mountains. Well known for its literary associations (a number of poets found inspiration in Koktebel) it is now becoming renowned for its annual Jazz Festival which started in 2003. This four day event which takes place in mid-September, has rapidly grown into the largest annual music festival in the Ukraine. </p>
