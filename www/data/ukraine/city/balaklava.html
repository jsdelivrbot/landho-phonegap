<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated in a very sheltered natural harbour, this attractive town lies on an "S" shaped inlet, about 10 miles due south of Sevastopol (by land, 20nm by sea). </p>
<p>Up to 1991, when the Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, this town housed a Russian submarine fleet and was completely closed to outsiders. Now, this super-secret base, with its underground labyrinth, is open to the public.</p>
<p>Climb up to the ruins of the Genoese fortress on the headland and you will see why Balaklava has been of such strategic, military importance over the centuries.</p>
<p>Position 44°29.2’N, 33°35.9’E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>One cruiser reported, "this is the safest natural harbour I have ever seen!".</p>
<p>The marina is reported to be the best in the area, with floating pontoons, water and electricity. Average depth 10m. It is pretty central and one can walk into town easily. Prices are reasonable.</p>
