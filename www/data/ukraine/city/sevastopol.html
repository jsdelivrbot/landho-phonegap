<div class="hello"><div><p>Sevastopol, on the SW corner of the Crimean peninsula, has very much the feel of a Russian city and that is the principal language spoken here. For many years it was a "closed" city due to the fact that it was an important Russian Naval base.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Ukraine/Balaklava">Balaklava</a><span> is part of Sevastopol, a distant district which is 15km away from Sevastopol's city limits, 30km away from city centre.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Update 2015:</b> Due to the uncertain situation in this region, it is recommended that cruisers avoid this area.</i></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This large harbour has several berthing options on its south side. For a full list of yacht clubs in Sevastopol, see the <a href="http://www.sevastopolsailing.org/clubs.php"><b>Sevastopol Sailing Federation Website</b></a> (in Russian but google translate works well and there are pictures).</p>
<p>As well as using the Passenger Ship Terminal (44°36.99’N, 33°31.62’E) for clearance if coming from outside the Ukraine, it can be used for longer term berthing offering easy access to the city. It is reported to be uncomfortable however with wash from passing vessels.</p>
<p>The fully serviced <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Ukraine/Balaklava/?rc=PortProfile#Docking"><b>Golden Symbol Marina</b></a> should also be considered in Balaklava. This is where the majority of cruising boats in the area are berthed.</p>
