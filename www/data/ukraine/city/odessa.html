<div class="hello"><div><p>As well as being a big, industrial city (fourth largest city in the Ukraine), Odessa is also a resort town and well known for its huge outdoor market. The "Seventh-Kilometer Market" is the largest market of its kind in Europe.
The architectural style here is more Mediterranean than Russian and the city has many fine buildings, parks and avenues. Prices are reported to be reasonable here.</p>
<p>The friendly yacht club is located inside the commercial port.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Arriving vessels must contact Odessa Port Control on Channel 14. It is strongly recommended that all vessels enter Odessa via the Vorontsov gateway on a course due south. </p>
<p>Yachts are now directed to the new Odessa Marina (46°29.5'N, 30°45'E), where clearance formalities will be completed. Immigration, Customs and Quarantine officials will visit the boat. The latter will request a deratting or exemption certificate, in the absence of which a new one will be issued at the cost of $US100. </p>
<p>There is also a fee for a health certificate, issued on arrival, at the cost of between $30 and $40.</p>
<p>Be prepared to allow at least half a day for both clearing in as well as clearing out.</p>
