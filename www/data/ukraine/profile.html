<div><ul>
<li>Set on the northern shores of the Black Sea, between the Azov Sea and the Danube Delta, the Ukraine has been endowed by nature with many more natural harbours than any of its neighbours. Some of these are on the Azov Sea, an enclosed body of water. This almost completely enclosed body of water is reached through a narrow cut, on the shores of which stands the old city of Kerch.</li>
<li><span>The Crimean sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Yalta and Yevpatoria have now been designated by the Ukrainian authorities as closed to international shipping.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The comments below refer to the situation in the  prior to 2014. Currently is is not clear where it is advisable to visit in the Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Facilities for yachts are limited but are constantly improving, and the opening of a new marina in Odessa has made a great difference to the comfort of visiting sailors.</li>
<li>Locals however have a limited understanding of sailing and tend to name anything that has sailing vessels housed there a "Yacht Club". Consequently, many ports have an abundance of Yacht Clubs, when in fact the majority are dinghy sailing clubs with no facilities for visiting cruising boats. </li>
<li>Several rallies held in the Black Sea in recent years have persuaded the authorities to bring about some considerable improvements to the yachting infrastructure. Independence and the freedom to travel have seen an amazing upsurge in the number of locally built sailing boats, some of which have been enjoying the new found freedom by sailing in large numbers to Greece and beyond. This interest in yachting should eventually result in better facilities for pleasure craft.</li>
<li><span>There is a new marina (Golden Symbol) at Balaklava, near Sevastopol. Marinas are also planned in Sevastopol itself (Yug), Ochakov, Alushta and Yalta. Yacht clubs at Nikolaev, Kherson and Sevastopol welcome visiting cruising boats. At other main ports, fuel and water can be arranged through an agent, for a fee.</span></li>
<li>The Crimean peninsula extends south into the Black Sea, with a picturesque coast always popular as a holiday destination, as can be seen by the many resorts.</li>
<li>A good source of information about the Ukraine can be found in the RCCPF guide, The Black Sea. See <a href="Countries/Ukraine/?rc=GeneralInfo#Publications"><strong>publications</strong></a></li>
<li>The small country of Moldova, Ukraine's western neighbour, only has a token exit to the Black Sea, on the right bank of the Dniester River.</li>

<div><p>The climate is temperate with hot summers and cold winters. Along the coast, the winds are very much influenced by the surrounding landmass and in summer there is a daily pattern of land and sea breezes. An onshore breeze comes up around midday and usually dies by dusk to be followed by a land breeze during the night.</p>
