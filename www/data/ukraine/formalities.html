            </h2>
<div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to recent events in Crimea and the Ukraine, the effect on cruising boats wishing to visit the area is unknown, but it is unlikely that private yachts will be permitted to visit the Crimea. (April 2014). No further information is available. (July 2016)</p>
<p>It is the law that an agent be used for clearance and it is advisable that a reliable one is identified in advance of arrival.</p>
<p>It is important that all your paperwork is in order as any problems that are discovered will cause considerable difficulties. However, formalities generally are still lengthy and cumbersome and one must be prepared to accept bureaucracy as a fact of life.</p>
<p>All officials will visit the yacht. Captain and crew must remain on board until formalities are completed.</p>
<p>On arrival at the port of entry a yacht should request a Customs document that covers all the ports to be visited in the Ukraine. This may take some time but it is worthwhile as at each subsequent port Immigration will only look at the paper or can be called by VHF if on anchor.</p>
<p><span>Be prepared for the coastguard to track the yacht's position on radar and request information each time one moves. Take care not to leave Ukraine territorial waters while cruising the coast.</span></p>
<p>The authorities must be given 24 hours' notice of departure. Entry and exit formalities must be carried out at every port where officials are present, and permission obtained to visit harbours where there are no officials.</p>
<p>An ecological certificate must be obtained in the port of departure stating that the vessel had not been guilty of polluting the sea or environment.</p>
<p>It is recommended that yachts enter and leave at Odessa as considerable difficulties with officialdom are likely to be experienced at other ports.</p>

<div><p>Citizens of the EU, USA, Canada, Japan, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland do not require a visa to visit the Ukraine for up to 90 days in a 6 month period. Citizens of other countries will need to obtain one in advance. Visa applications do not now generally require a letter of invitation, although local consulates may say differently.</p>
<p>In exceptional situations a visa may be granted on arrival, but only for a very short stay. To simplify matters it is therefore advisable to obtain a visa in advance.</p>
<p>Visas and other arrangements can be made in Istanbul, where the best place to stop is at Ataköy Marina, approximately 5 miles west of the Bosphorus. The management of the marina has an arrangement with the authorities in Odessa, as well as with the Odessa Yacht Club, and can also help with the latest information. Advance help and practical advice for anyone planning to visit any of the Black Sea countries, not just the Ukraine, can be obtained from Ataköy Marina, Tel. +90 212 560 4270, Fax. 7270, e-mail <a href="mailto:marina@atakoymarina.com.tr">marina@atakoymarina.com.tr</a> <a href="http://www.atakoymarina.com.tr/"><strong>www.atakoymarina.com.tr/</strong></a></p>
<p>The Ukrainian consulate in Istanbul is open Fridays and Saturdays, 0900-1200, near the Bosphorus passenger terminal: c/o BASCO Shipping &amp; Trade SA, 5th floor, Maliye Caddesi 29, Karaköy. Intourist, the Russian state tourist agency, offer a visa service for the CIS republics.</p>
<p>All visitors are required to purchase health insurance from the Ukraine state-run insurance company. The cost is quite low ($2 for upto 5 days, $12 for up to 30 days).</p>

<div><p>Once cleared in to the Ukraine, a yacht <strong>must</strong> stay within Ukrainian territorial waters (i.e. less than 12 miles off-shore) if you don’t want to run the risk of being stopped by the coast guard.</p>
<p><span>Now the Crimea is under Russian control, it is essential to keep well outside territorial waters in this area as it is very unlikely that private yachts will be permitted to visit in the near future. (April 2014)</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a culture of lack of respect for private property and security can be a problem as people will happily try to board a yacht to take photos. Fenced and gated marinas will stop only a few.</span></span></p></div>
