<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts should pick up the yellow quarantine buoy off the ferry dock.</p>
<p>First go to customs, which is upstairs in the 2-story building immediately to the right of the ferry dock entrance(the Cotton Ginnery), open 0800-1200, 1300-1600 weekdays. Then check in with The Port Authority at the dock.</p>
<p>Immigration is in the police station, which is on the right, down Main Street.</p>
<p>A permit no longer seems be required to visit anchorages on Nevis. It is no longer necessary to return to Customs for clearance to sail over to St Kitts.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are now 80+ moorings in Pinneys Bay and anchoring is no longer permitted there. The moorings are reported to be well managed and inspected. <span>There are no dinghy docks in the area as they were destroyed by a tropical storm and landing is very difficult on the steep-to beach.</span></p>
<p><span>Pay for your mooring at the Customs Dock right above the town dock.</span></p>
<p>The Four Seasons hotel has now re-opened and it is possible to anchor close by.</p>
<p>Extension of the Tender Pier in Charlestown Port should be completed by the start of the 2014 winter season. This will be available for yachts and tenders.</p>
