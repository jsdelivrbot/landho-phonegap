<div class="hello"><div><p>Basseterre is one of the most attractive towns in the Caribbean, with a range of both French and English architecture.</p>
<p>Following its virtual destruction by hurricanes George and Lenny in 2003, the entrance and protective breakwater of the marina have been redesigned so to render it calm and safe from surge. However that said, cruisers have reported a 20 degree roll here which makes it unsafe for yachts in certain weather conditions.</p>
<p>Cruise ships arrive every day during high season and their life boats take priority on the main wall, bringing in hundreds of passengers.</p>
<p>Position 17° 17'10"N, 62° 43'14"W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Due to the rolly nature of the anchorage here, berthing in the Zante marina is the more comfortable option. <span>The marina is located west of the deep water dock.</span></p>
<p>Care must be taken on approaching the marina at night as many of the pilings from the original cruise ship dock are still there. Contact the marina manager on VHF CH 16 or 68 to arrange a berth.</p>
<p><span>The marina is very small and only has a few berths available for visiting yachts, all the others are occupied with local boats. </span><span>There is no dedicated dinghy dock.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A new marina for superyachts opened at Christophe Harbour in February 2015. It has a wide access channel, 24 alongside berths from 45-65 meters and duty free in-slip fueling.<br/><span><b><a class="external-link" href="http://ChristopheHarbour.com">www.ChristopheHarbour.com</a></b></span></span></span></p>

      Water, electricity, and cable are available. Fuel is now available directly on the eastern dock. 24 hour security. Maximum beam in most slips is about 15' but there are some extra-wide slips which can take multi-hulls. The marina depth is said to be 13' but care should be taken near the new rock wall as some boulders may have rolled away from the base of the wall. Restaurants, bars and provisions all within walking distance.
