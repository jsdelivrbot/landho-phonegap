<div><p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/"><strong>SailClear</strong></a><span> advance web notification service for clearance is now operational. Users previously registered with the old eSeaClear system will find all their details have been carried over to the new system.</span></p>
<p>There is now a Customs office at Zante Marina and this the most convenient place to berth the boat and complete formalities. <span>Clearance is yacht-friendly here and cruisers report 2014 that the SailClear system is fully operational at this marina. </span></p>
<p>No special clearance for Nevis is now required.</p>
<p>There are similar arrangements for clearing out from Nevis to St Kitts. Arrangements can also be made to visit anchorages outside the Ports of Entry after clearance for another country has been granted.</p>

<div><p>Be aware that Black coral and most other corals, whether in chunks or in jewellry may not be purchased or collected.</p>
<p>No jet-skis or similar craft may be used by visiting yachts.</p>
<p>Scuba diving may only be done with a local dive shop.</p>

<div><p><span>An Import Permit must be obtained from the Chief Veterinary Officer before arrival (see below for website link to form). </span><span>There is a processing fee of US$20 (postal order only).</span></p>
<p>Once the permit is obtained in advance, inform the vet 72 hours before arrival (by email). On arrival, go ashore without your pet and clear in, informing the customs authorities how many animals you have on board. They will call the vet and make an appointment, who will come to the customs office, normally within 24 hours. They will inspect the animal/s and clear it/them in.</p>
<p><span><span>If you can be reasonably certain of your arrival time, then the vet can come at the same time as you clear in, saving two trips to customs. The vet fee for clearing in is EC$200.</span></span></p>
<p>On departure, if the next island to be visited requires a health certificate (not the case if you are going to Guadeloupe, for example), then call the vet directly a few days in advance and make an appointment. They will come to the same customs office and inspect your pet and issue a health certificate.</p>
<p>Fees for this are reported to be similar to the clearing-in fee.</p>
