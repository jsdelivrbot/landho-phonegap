<ul>
<li>The Federation of St Christopher (more popularly known as St Kitts) and Nevis is part of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.</li>
<li>St Kitts and Nevis are rather off the cruising track. It is a tough return beating against wind and current to more popular Antigua.</li>
<li>The rebuilding of Port Zante Marina at Basseterre following hurricane damage means a considerable improvement to facilities; breakwaters have been redesigned to make the marina much more protected from surge than formerly.</li>
<li>Although they do not abound in scenic anchorages, the islands themselves are extremely attractive and their interesting past makes visiting ashore a worthwhile experience. </li>
<li>Facilities are very basic on Nevis where there are plans to build a small marina at Fort Charles, at the southern end of Charlestown. Another development is planned at the old Newcastle harbour, on the NW side of the island near the airport. </li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p>Check the Noonsite <a href="General/Piracy">Piracy Pages</a> and the <a href="http://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/NEWS.html">Caribbean Safety &amp; Security Net</a> for information on the current island situation.</p><p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>

<div><p>There is no customs office at Zante Marina for the time being, but this is still the more convenient place to berth the boat and complete formalities in Basseterre which is best reached by taxi. There are plans for the clearance facilities to be reinstated at Zante Marina.</p>
<p><b>St. Kitts – St Christophe Harbour - 2014 update: </b><span>Works are ongoing but seem to be delayed and marina seems quite far from being operational.</span></p></div>
