<ul>
<li>Bermuda is an archipelago of over 150 small islands and islets, the largest linked together by causeways and bridges into a fish hook shape.</li>
<li>Bermuda Radio monitors the waters around Bermuda as well as controlling the harbour traffic. They will put a radar tag onto your vessel as soon as the boat is within approximately 50 miles of the reefs, and will keep an eye on the course during the approach to the Islands. As soon as you are within range, you should contact Bermuda Radio on VHF Channel 16 and tell them who you are.</li>
<li>Bermuda Radio is situated on the highest point in Bermuda and is one of the most powerful radio stations in the world so you will be able to hear them long before the 50-mile reef zone. Yachts not wishing to make an entry through Town Cut during the hours of darkness may anchor off St. David’s Head.  Bermuda Radio will decide if they are happy to allow you to make a nighttime entry.</li>
<li>Although Bermuda has little to offer in the way of cruising, every year over 1000 yachts stop here to rest and reprovision after a long passage, or simply to turn around at the finish of one of the many ocean races which run from the US East Coast. Most yachts arrive from the Caribbean in April and May, some on their way to Europe, others to the USA. Later in the autumn Bermuda sees another influx as yachts make their way south from the USA to the Caribbean.</li>
<li>The well-sheltered St George's Harbour provides a restful anchorage from which to explore this neat and tidy little country. Such exploring is best done by land. The alternative anchorage is in Hamilton, but as all yachts have to clear in first at St George's, few bother to sail out afterwards and around the island to thread their way through the reefs to Hamilton harbour.</li>
<li>Although existing repair and service facilities are dispersed all over Bermuda rather than being grouped together, virtually everything one may need is available on the island even if it may take some time to find it. Marine supplies or essential parts that are unavailable can be ordered from the USA to which there are several flights every day.</li>

<div><p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net
(<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>)
gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their
cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and
precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have information about
a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward
details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most
comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on
the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and
anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>

<div><p>The Gulf Stream makes the climate subtropical, with mild winters and warm humid summers. The Azores high dominates the summer months, bringing steady SW winds. June to November is the hurricane season with September the most dangerous month, although the majority of these storms pass to the west of Bermuda.</p>
