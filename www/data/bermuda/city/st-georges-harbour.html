<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival all yachts must proceed to the Customs dock on the right hand side of the main channel 500m after the exit to the cut behind the Cream building with green shutters, usually under the bows of a large cruise ship. Beware that the inter island high-speed ferry docks upstream from the Customs dock so may be maneuvering in the area.</p>
<p>The Customs dock only has posts and no cleats so for ease of docking make large bowlines in your mooring lines and be prepared to tighten them onboard</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are anchorages in both St George's and Hamilton harbours. Convict Bay &amp; Powder Hole <span>are safe anchorages and are</span> close to SGDSC which has a dinghy dock.  In south-westerly winds, anchoring in the shelter at the top of St George’s Bay can be more comfortable.</p>
<p>In St George's there are some berths available at Somers Wharf, Hunters Wharf (east), and the north side of Ordnance Island. All vessels that intend to dock alongside a wharf or pier owned by the Corporation of St. George's (Tel. (441) 297-1532) will be charged a fee per day based upon the footage of the vessel. The St. George's Dockmaster is responsible for the collection of fees. The Dockmaster can be contact on VHF Channel 14 after clearance is completed at the Yacht Reporting Centre, Ordnance Island. Payment can be made in cash, or by major credit card. A receipt will be issued.</p>
<p>Yachts can berth at Market Wharf West (48 hours only), Market Wharf East (limited to 1/2 hour only), Somers Wharf (all day) and Hunters Wharf (all day).  Fees for visiting yachts depend on length of yacht, however some reports from cruisers state that it is cheaper to find a marina berth.</p>
<p>Pennos Wharf and Ordnance Island are commercial piers reserved for ship traffic. When tied to these berths, yachts may be requested to leave at short notice by Bermuda Harbour Radio and therefore a listening watch on VHF Channel 16 should be maintained at all times. Vessels left unmanned and in the way of inbound shipping could be towed off the dock.</p>
<p>Better docking facilities are available at Dockyard Marina, but this is far from most amenities. Berthing alongside in Hamilton is restricted to yacht club berths, boat yards and marinas, and is usually chargeable. Charges may be obtained on application from the Dockyard Marina (a full service marina), the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club, and others.</p>
<p>The Corporation of Hamilton has made available a floating dock at Barr's Bay Park for visiting yachtsmen to tie up their dinghies while running errands in the City of Hamilton area.</p>

      Plenty of safe anchorage close to the Club with tender space. Be aware that there are unmarked wrecks.<br>
The club can assist with filling your propane gas bottle. If a number of boats are interested, duty free fuel can be arranged but you have to leave the dinghy club dock and move to Pennos Wharf to be refilled from the back of a road tanker. If filling jerry cans then please ensure that all jerry cans are on deck with their lids removed so that time is not wasted.<br>
Cube ice available. Laundry facility with 4 washers and 6 driers (Bermuda dollars only). Showers need tokens ($3 from Club bar) and last 5 mins. WiFi available.
