<div class="hello"><div><p>This long, thin chain of linked islands, called Sandys Parish, form the NW arm of the large bay known as Great Sound. Hamiton Harbour is on the eastern side of this area. The Royal Naval Dockyard sits on the very tip of North Ireland island. It was abandoned as a military establishment in 1995 and has since been converted into various visitor attractions.</p>
