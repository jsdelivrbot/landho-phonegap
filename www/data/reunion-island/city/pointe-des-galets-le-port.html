<div class="hello"><div><p>Located on the NW of the island, about 15km west of the capital, St Dennis. Port de la Pointe des Galets is usually referred to simply as "Le Port".</p>
<p>It is an artificial harbour in the western part of Le Port area. This is<span> an industrial area with little in the way of attractions for a visitor.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/ReunionIsland?rc=Formalities">Reunion Island Clearance</a></strong> for full details of clearing in and out here.</p>
<p>If planning to arrive at Le Port, it is recommended that you ensure you have a berth (email your request) before leaving your previous port. It is unlikely however you will be turned away should you arrive unannounced.</p>
<p>Make sure you receive acknowledgement of the receipt of your Arrival Notification form (<span>Declaration De D'Entree ).</span></p>
<p>If arriving outside marina hours, tie up alongside the fisherman's wharf south of the entrance (<span>depth is 5.5m)</span>. Alterntively proceed farther south to the marina and tie up alongside the reception pontoon, in front of the Port Captain’s office (the architecture of which was inspired by the Sydney Opera House).</p>
<p>Deep-drafted boats should not proceed beyond the fishing wharf, where the depth is 5.5 m. Contact the marina manager who will advise on the correct procedure.</p>
<p>Yachts which arrive outside working hours usually have to wait until offices open.</p>
<p>When planning on departing, it's recommended to clear out<span> 2 days before your departure .</span></p>

<p>The two parts of this marina are managed by the same team. The office is in the old marina. <span>It is the small Sydney Opera House looking building in the northeast corner.</span></p>
<p>The old marina (Port de Plaisance) is south of the commercial harbour. <i>(photo left)</i></p>
<p>August 2015: There is now a new 80 berth marina here, located on the eastern side of the commercial harbour and just 5 minute walk from the town centre. This is where visiting yachts are most likely to be allocated a berth.</p>
