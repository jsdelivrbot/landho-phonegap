<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../reunion-pics/reunion_scattered-islands-map/@@images/image/preview"/>The Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean consist of four small coral islands, an atoll, and a reef in the Indian Ocean, and have constituted the 5th district of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) since February 2007. They belong to France and the Reunion Commissioner has jurisdiction over these uninhabited islands.</p>
<p><span>Three of the islands - the Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova and Europa - and the Bassas da India atoll, lie in the Mozambique Channel west of Madagascar, while the fourth island, Tromelin, lies about 450 kilometres (280 mi) east of Madagascar. Also in the Mozambique Channel is the Banc du Geyser, a reef under French control claimed by Madagascar since 1976. France and the Comoros view the Banc du Geyser as part of the Glorioso Islands.</span></p>
<p>A permit is required for visiting yachts who wish to visit these islands and should be applied for up to 2 months in advance of your visit. S<span>hort stays of up to a few days are tolerated however without a permit, if in transit to Mayotte.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Europa<br/></strong><span>The only recognized moorings are located on the sandy plateau that borders the reef off the north coast. This anchorage is very exposed to north winds.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Bassas da India<br/></strong><span>Anchor in a depth of 21m in sand with broken coral, approx. 300m NE of the eastern end of the reef.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Juan de Nova<br/></strong><span>The only possible anchorage here is in the lagoon off the north coast. This lagoon is exposed to the north wind sector. There is a meteorological station here and visitors are not welcome.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong><span><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/e507ea1ac84248d2955146ac169aff2c/@@images/image/preview"/>Glorieuse</span><br/></strong><span> In 2012, France founded <i>parc naturel marin des Glorieuses</i>, a marine protected area, to preserve the endangered flora and fauna of the islands. There are anchorages offshore and at Île du Lys.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The following anchorage information from SY Mala who visited the Glorieuse Islands in October 2015 and provided the adjacent photo: </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i> </i></strong>There are no dangers on the approaches to the Glorieuse Islands, which consist of two main islands, <span style="text-align: justify; ">Île du Lys (</span>N) and Grande Glorieuse (S). There is a reef connecting their eastern sides. If approaching from the NE (i.e. with the wind on passage from the Seychelles to Mayotte) round the N tip of <span style="text-align: justify; ">Île du Lys</span> and approach the anchorage from the NNW.</p>
<p>The anchorage is on a large sand bank with depths from 4-8m and just a few low lying coral heads (less than 2m from the bottom). It is possible to anchor at night, following these WP:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>11 29.732S / 47 22.814E<br/><span>11 30.298S / 47 21.907E<br/></span><span>11 30.758S / 47 22.084E<br/></span><span>11 31.287S / 47 22.086E</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>The anchorage is at WP 11 31.334S / 47 22.151E in sand in 4-6m (depending on tide) with excellent holding and at least 40m from the nearest coral head (which is only 1m high). Of course, this is only one possibility. If arriving during the day, finding a suitable spot is very simple. The anchorage is sheltered from northerly winds but from swell all the way through from N thru E to S. Navionics as well as CM93 are very accurate and precise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Tromelin<br/></strong><span>Anchor to the NW of Tromelin Island in depths of 13m. It is not possible to land here. </span></p>
