<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a Port of Entry.<br/><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/ReunionIsland/PointedesGalets%28LePort%29/Countries/ReunionIsland?rc=Formalities">Reunion Island Clearance</a></strong><span> for full details of clearing in and out here.</span></p>
<p>Clearing in here was reported to be very relaxed in 2013 with no problems if you arrive at weekends. However in 2014 the Port Master of <a class="external-link" href="Countries/ReunionIsland/PointedesGalets%28LePort%29"><strong>Le Port</strong> </a>confirmed that yachts could only clear during working hours, so the same may apply here now.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is essential to telephone in advance to ensure there is space. If not, yachts will be turned away.</p>
<p>The port entrance is quite difficult and the approach can look a little daunting, however there are clear range markers. If the swell is too high, the harbour will be closed. Call in advance on Ch.16 or 09 if possible.</p>
<p>The approach heading leading to the first pair of markers is 354 degrees true. The second pair of markers leads through the entrance on a bearing of 029 degrees true. When level with the port side breakwater (red light) favour that side and pass between a red beacon and two green buoys to reach the marina. The water on the starboard side of those buoys is shallow.</p>
<p><span>The marina in St. Pierre is right in the middle of the city, and one can walk off the boat to supermarkets, bakeries, etc in a few minutes. Also, for surfers, there is a great break just on the other side of the breakwater (a 30 second walk from the marina).</span></p>
