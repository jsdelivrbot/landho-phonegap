<div><p><b>Update August 2016:</b> Due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth <span>disease in Rodrigues and Mauritius, yachts arriving at La Reunion Islands are being subject to a strict search by DAAF officials immediately on arrival. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/ReunionIsland?rc=Formalities#Customs"><b>Customs section</b></a> below for more details.</span></p>
<p>Clearance procedures are straightforward. The Douane (Customs) deal with all the necessary paperwork. Remain on board until this is completed.</p>
<p>Yachts which arrive outside working hours usually have to wait until offices open. Customs officers work 05:00 to 20:00 (Mon-Sat). They do not work Sundays.</p>
<p>When planning on departing, it's recommended to clear out 2 days before your departure .</p>

<div><p>All visitors (including French citizens) require a passport valid for 6 months.</p>
<p>Even though Reunion is an overseas territory of France, and <strong>is</strong> a member of the EU, it is <strong>not </strong>part of the Schengen Area Agreement. The visa requirements are similar to those of France. <span>Citizens of the EU do not require a visa.</span></p>
<p><span>Many other nationalities do not require a visa for stays of up to 3 months, but if wishing to stay longer they must apply for a <em>carte de séjour </em>(residence permit). Contact the Service  des Étrangers (<span class="tel"></span>0262 40 77 77; 4 Place de la  Préfecture) at the Préfecture in St Denis.<br/></span></p>
<p>All other nationalities require visas, which should be obtained from a French embassy or consulate in advance. Ensure that the visa given is valid for Reunion as those for mainland France are not valid for Reunion..</p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared on arrival.</p>
<p>There are restrictions on the importation of plants.</p>
<p><b>August 2016:</b> DAAF officials will meet the boat on arrival and will remove <b>all</b> dairy and meat products. This even includes any such products which have been imported from outside Mauritius.  The officials will search the boat, and are friendly, but strict.</p>
<p>Yachts can stay up to six months in one or several visits during a 12-month period, without paying duty, as long as the crew do not enter into employment ashore or charter the vessel. If the owner wants to leave Reunion by other means, the vessel has to be put in the custody of Customs until the owner's return. The ship's papers must be left with Customs. This period will be deducted from the time spent in Reunion.</p>
