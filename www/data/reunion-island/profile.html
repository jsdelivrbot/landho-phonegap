<div><ul>
<li>La Reunion Island is a small French island in the South Indian Ocean lying south-west of Mauritius. It is a useful stop for yachts sailing from the latter to South Africa. It is an "overseas department" (<i>département d'outre-mer</i> or <i>DOM</i>) of France.</li>
<li>With a large resident sailing community, Reunion has the best yachting facilities of any island in the Indian Ocean.</li>
<li>The marina at Pointe des Galets on the West coast is well-sheltered and most cruising sailors tend to stop here. The capital St Denis is 17 km away.</li>
<li>Facilities are better in the town of St Pierre in the south of the island where the marina was recently expanded and repair facilities are good. The entrance into the port is quite difficult due a sand bank limiting access, but there are good range markers. The marina is situated in the centre of town, berthing rates are good, with places for visiting boats and 24 hour security.</li>
<li>There is also a small marina at Saint Gilles les Bains, near the island's best beaches and a centre for charter operations.</li>
<li>The lush interior of this volcanic island has some stunning mountain scenery, and many people go walking in the mountains. It is a last opportunity to stretch one's legs before the long and possibly rough passage to South Africa.</li>
<li><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/ReunionIsland/iles-eparses-scattered-islands/">The Scattered Islands</a></b> - Juan de Nova, Europa, Bassas da India, Iles Glorieuses and Tromelin - are uninhabited islands near Madagascar. After Madagascan independence they remained French, and are administered by the Reunion Commissioner. Tromelin is claimed by both the Seychelles and Mauritius.</li>
<li><span>NOTE: Duty free diesel is available after clearing out at 0.66 EUR per litre (August 2015) </span></li>
<li><span>Provisioning: Prices are normally more expensive than Mauritius. Large hypermarket with European brands. </span></li>

The island is divided by its mountain range into the lusher, rainier windward side and the drier leeward side to the south and west. Reunion lies in the SE trade wind area, and the cyclone season is from mid-November to April. The island is occasionally affected by cyclones.</p>
