<ul>
<li>The Ivory Coast, or La Côte d'Ivoire, lies on the northern shore of the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. Until not long ago it was regarded as the most stable regime in the region and tried to build up its tourism as an alternative to the agriculture-dominated economy. However the political situation has become more uncertain in recent years.  </li>

<div><p>Although the security situation here has improved since April 2011, the travel advice from the UK and USA is to "advise against all but essential travel to the western regions of Dix-Huit Montagnes, Haut-Sassandra, Moyen-Cavally and Bas-Sassandra."</p>
<p>The intervention in Mali in 2013 has increased the risk of terrorist attacks in the region.</p>
<p>Additional advice:-  You should take care not to be prominent, particularly at night.  Do not use taxis or public transport at night.</p>
