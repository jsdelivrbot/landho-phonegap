            </h2>
<div><p>At your first Port of Entry, fly the <code>Q</code> flag. This is important.</p>
<p>Ensure you have a Jamaican courtesy flag to fly once clearance has been completed. This is also important.</p>
<p>Report your arrival immediately. Officials (Customs, Immigration and Health) will normally come to the boat. The usual papers are required.</p>
<p>Customs may ask for a list of boat equipment.  Customs is the agency in charge of your port to port movements.  At each port, check in with Customs. You do not have to do full clearance at every port.</p>
<p>You can stop between ports provided you have a reasonable explanation (too tired to go on, in need of repairs etc.)</p>
<p>There is no cost to Clearing into Jamaica during normal working hours (09:00-16.30(Mon-Fri). Outside these hours there is a reasonable charge.</p>
<p>A detailed itinerary will be required and then a cruising permit (a <code>Transire</code>)will be issued. This is the document <strong>must</strong> be presented to Customs at every stop.</p>
<p>Yachts are monitored and if checking in late or making unauthorised stops (without sufficient reason) you may be fined. Yachts clearing in from foreign ports may not be allowed to dock until given permission by Customs.</p>
<p>The best ports at which to clear in are Kingston, Ocho Rios, Port Antonio and Montego Bay as the officials here are used to yachts. Port Esquivel, <span> Port Kaiser</span> and Discovery Bay are also Ports of Entry but normally used by commercial ships.</p>

<div><p>Dengue fever and Leptospirosis are risks in Jamaica, so visitors should use insect protection measures and avoid rivers and dams. Malaria is also a risk occurs and it is advisable to take precautions against mosquito bites.</p>
<p>Drinking Water - Piped-in water is usually safe to drink because it is filtered and chlorinated. However, the chlorination could cause mild abdominal upsets, so if you're prone to stomach problems, it may be wise to drink only bottled water, which is readily available.</p>
<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Jamaica is an area of interest with multiple reported cases. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
