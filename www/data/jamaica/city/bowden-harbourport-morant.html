<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Jamaica?rc=Formalities">Jamaica Formalities</a></strong><span> for full details re. clearing into and out of Jamaica.</span></p>
<p>Although this is officially a Port of Entry it may not be the best place to try and clear into Jamaica. It's likely you will be charged to bring the officials from Kingston for clearance (approx. US$65).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor in front of the Coast Guard station. If it is free, they may suggest that you berth at their dock. They are very friendly and welcoming. The dock was originally a small marina which went out of business. It has water available.</p>
<p>The small town of Morant Bay is across the harbour and the approach is very shallow for the last 100m or so. It has a small restaurant.</p>
