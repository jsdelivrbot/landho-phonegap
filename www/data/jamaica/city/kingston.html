<div class="hello"><div><p>Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island.</p>
<p>Position 17° 54.29'N, 076° 44.16'W (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<p>Yachts can contact Morgan's Harbour or the Royal Jamaica Yacht Club on Channel 16 and request permission to come alongside. Both these clubs are located in the Port Royal area. Arrangements can then be made to clear in at either club.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are three marinas in the Kingston area and several anchorages.</p>
<p>The Royal Jamaica Yacht Club maintains a marina-type facility about 12 miles from Kingston, where visitors belonging to reputable clubs are always welcome. <span>Although the yacht club offers excellent security including CCTV and permanent security staff covering the facility 24/7, this does not extend to boats anchored outside the marina. Inevitably owners of yachts anchored off the marina should follow reasonable security measures applicable to anchoring in any Caribbean open commercial harbour.</span></p>
<p>Morgan's Harbour Club at Port Royal has similar docking facilities, as well as fuel and water.</p>
<p>Peter Black’s Dry Dock and Marina is immediately to the east of Morgan’s Marina. It is a small T head that can accommodate a limited number of boats.</p>
<p>A few miles from the entrance is Lime Cay. This is a protected anchorage, used by many of the local yachtsmen. It is backed by a white sandy beach.</p>
<p>It is <strong>not recommeded</strong> that you anchor in Cow Bay or Bull Bay, both of which lie about 6 to 8 miles SE of Kingston. Yachts have been boarded here in the past.</p>
