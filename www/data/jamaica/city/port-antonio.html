<div class="hello"><div><p>The newest marina at Port Antonio (now called Errol Flynn Marina) has the best facilities and the staff are very helpful. It is a government-owned marina and is in the West harbour.</p>
<p>The two old marinas are now mostly in disrepair.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor off the marina in West Harbour, or pick up a mooring, for a daily fee which includes the marina security and use of the dinghy dock, <span>showers, WiFi, laundry access and pool usage.</span></p>
<p><span>T</span><span>here is also a small daily garbage and environmental fee for boats at anchor or berthed in a marina.</span></p>
<p><span>See latest fees reported by cruisers at bottom of page under comments.</span></p>
<p>The entire shoreline at West Harbour lies inside a gated, fenced perimeter. Along the length of the waterfront runs a boardwalk and park. The area is accessed through a security gate. It is a very lively place, popular with the locals and visitors, especially on the weekends.</p>
<p><span>It is possible to get basic provisions here or take a bus into Kingston, which takes 3 hours.</span></p>
