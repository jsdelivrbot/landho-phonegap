<p>Customs and Immigration officials are located in the wharf area of Montego Freeport.</p>
<p>It is best to proceed directly to the Montego Bay Yacht Club who should be contacted on Channel 16. <span>Customs, Immigration and Health come to the Yacht Club and there are no charges in normal working hours. Overtime is $68 which can be shared with other yachts.</span></p>
<p>The club is open daily from 09:00 to 24:00 and visitors are welcomed.</p>
<p>If berthing at Pier 1, the Park Office above the marina office will also call Customs and Immigration for you.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Yachts can anchor adjacent to the Yacht Club between moorings and the big ship turning circle marked by buoys and beacons (which is used frequently). The anchoring area here is very limited with poor holding, so extra scope is required to allow for strong winds which blow the length of the harbour most days. It can also be rather uncomfortable here due to wash from big ships.</span></p>
<p><span>Yachts can also moor stern-to at the yacht club using one of the mooring balls. <span>Be cautious if asked to dock on the exposed eastern side of the dock where there is a long fetch and it can be quite rough when the trade winds are blowing strongly.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>There is also an anchorage near Pier 1 Marina, but this is not secure, and in Bogue Lagoon, but neither have any facilities.</span></p>
<p>The Montego Bay Yacht Club does offer its facilities to visiting yachts for a fee (see comments below for current prices).</p>
