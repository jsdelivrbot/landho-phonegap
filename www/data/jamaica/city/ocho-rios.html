<div class="hello"><div><p>When cruising along the north coast, Ocho Rios makes a useful stop between Port Antonio and Montego Bay. This small bay is enclosed on one side by a cruise ship terminal and is lined by hotels whose clients make full use of the wet bikes available. It is a very 'touristy' town with all the facilities required by such visitors.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This bay is generally exposed to swell and winds from the north.</p>
<p>Anchor in centre of the harbour, which has good holding, but it is exposed to the winds. Alternatively, try and find space to sta'bd in the more protected  area called the <code>marina basin</code>.</p>
<p>A further option, but which will involve a longer dinghy ride, is outside the harbour, behind the reef. This will offer protection from the swell.</p>
<p>In spite of plans to do so, no marina has been built here.</p>
