<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit andcredit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p>

<p>Digicel operate here and you can buy a pre-paid data bundle through them. You can then use your smartphone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for the rest of the crew, also link by USB to your own PC. Cruisers report this is much more cost effective than any of the Wi-Fi services, and of course is available throughout the islands that Digicel serves.</p>
<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/>Anyone cruising through the islands using Digicel should be aware that you cannot top up a sim from one island in another as used to be able to. So if for example you want to use your Grenada sim while cruising north you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs or you can set up an account and do it online, but you cannot get it topped up in another island.<br/>You can top-up Digicel at <a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p>
<p>Cruisers report that Digicel connection works fine nearly everywhere (3G) with only Isle de Ronde and Tyrrel Bay, Tobago Cays, Mayreau, Union and Canouan getting 2G.</p>
<p>Remember to follow your Gb usage, or the money runs out quickly.</p>
