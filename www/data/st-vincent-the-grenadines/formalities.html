<div><p><span>Visiting yachts arriving in St Vincent territorial waters must proceed to a port of entry to clear in before stopping in any other port or anchorage.</span></p>
<p>Fly the 'Q' flag and dock or anchor in the port of entry. Only the captain should go ashore. Three crew lists, clearance from previous port, passports and ship's papers will be needed. Clearance must also be done with the port authorities, Customs and Immigration.</p>
<p>A cruising permit is issued for one month and is renewable.</p>
<p>It is necessary to clear out at one of the official ports. For southbound boats, formalities are simplest at Clifton on Union Island where you can clear Customs in the port, but Immigration is based at the airport, which is very close.</p>
<p><span> Yachts are given 24 hours after check-out from which they must depart St. Vincent waters. </span></p>
