<div><ul>
<li>The island of St. Vincent plus over 30 Grenadine Islands have always been a popular yachting destination. Cruising attractions include the unspoilt Tobago Cays (now the Tobago Cays Marine Park) and the exclusive Mustique.</li>
<li>The Northern Grenadines are administered by St. Vincent, while the smaller southern group belongs to Grenada.</li>
<li>On Bequia, Port Elizabeth in Admiralty Bay is one of the most famous watering holes on the international cruising scene, however the range of repair facilities is more limited than St. Vincent.</li>
<li>Ottley Hall Marina and Shipyard near Kingstown, St. Vincent, provides a complete range of repair and service facilities; there are also good repair facilities at Young Island and Blue Lagoon.</li>
<li>A marina development on the south-west side of Canouan offers some services. On the other Grenadines, facilities are very basic.</li>

<div><p><strong>St. Vincent, </strong><span><strong>Wallilabou Bay:</strong><br/></span>In the early hours of Friday 4 March 2016, a yacht at anchor in Wallilabou Bay in St. Vincent was boarded by masked armed gunmen and a German crew member shot and killed. <br/>Read full report <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/st-vincent-wallilabou-bay-masked-gunmen-kill-german-man-on-yacht-march-2016">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Areas to be Vigilant:</strong><br/>Reports to Noonsite of theft from yachts at anchor in this part of the Caribbean (in some cases armed robbery) have increased over the last few years (see reports adjacent). Current advice is to be vigilant if planning on anchoring in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/chateaubelair">Chateaubelair,</a></strong> and to be extra vigilant with security measures in all anchorages on the West Coast of St. Vincent and around the Grenadines, in particular <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/PortElizabeth%28Bequia%29">Admiralty Bay</a></strong>, Bequia, <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/TobagoCays">Tobago Cays</a> and <a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/Canouan">Canouan</a> </strong>(latest report June 2016).</p>
<p>Be sure to<strong> lock all hatches</strong> when leaving the boat unattended and in particular<strong> during the night whilst sleeping on board.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bequia:</strong> <br/>Bequia Coastguard are now patrolling at night, however their resources are limited and cruisers need to remain vigilant.<strong> <a href="Members/doina/R2008-01-04-1/">St. Vincent Coastguard Advice to Yacht Owners</a></strong>. Noonsite continues to receive reports of burglary/attempted break-in, from yachts in Bequia.</p>
<p><strong>VHF Channel 66 Repeater</strong> was privately donated to the Grenadian Government and is used by the Grenada Cruisers Net to provide coverage to all Grenadian waters. It can also be received in southern parts of St Vincent and the Grenadines and the northern parts of Trinidad including Chaguaramas Bay. The Grenada Cruisers Net supplies weather, advice, and information on many subjects to help make Cruisers’ stay in Grenada more rewarding. Its broadcast each day at 7:30 AM.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue 1</strong> is a private rescue service of the Prickly Bay Marina, Grenada, and is on call 24 hours each day. As well as the rescue vessel it provides excellent liaison between cruisers, Police, Coast Guard, and other Authorities.</p>
<p><span>Dinghy and outboard thieves operate throughout the Caribbean. Best advice is to place your dinghy and outboard on deck and chain them securely overnight. If leaving the yacht, secure your outboard inside the boat to deter thieves.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</strong> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</strong> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></strong></p>
