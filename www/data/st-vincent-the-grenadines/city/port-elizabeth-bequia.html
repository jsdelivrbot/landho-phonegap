<div class="hello"><div><p>As Bequia is used to yachts, so clearing in at Port Elizabeth is straightforward.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Admiralty Bay is sheltered and can accommodate a large number of yachts. Mooring buoys are available in addition to a small marina, or you can anchor either side of the central ferry channel. Be aware of the depth and be sure to leave plenty of room for the ferries or you will be moved. If you use a mooring, dive down to check it - you may be surprised. Because of the crowding you may end up a long way from shore.</p>
<p>To the SW of the ferry dock there is a pair of large red and green buoys - nothing to do with port and starboard - the tanker moors between them when it comes in, so keep well clear.</p>
<p>A better anchorage may be found at Tony Gibbons Beach (also called Princess Margaret Beach), although break-ins continue to be reported here.</p>
<p>Another good anchorage is in Friendship Bay, on the south-eastern side. It is a short distance over the hill from Lower Bay. This sheltered bay provides a secure anchorage for yachts with good holding in sand, but watch out for the small moorings on the east side of bay. It also offers excellent snorkelling, scuba and windsurfing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> West Cay, at the far south west of Bequia, is shown as being 2 cables further west than it actually is on the Navionics electronic chart.</p>
<p>There are several dinghy docks available around Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Garbage facilities are by the market at the northern end.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong></p>
<p>The local VHF channel for hailing which is locally monitored is channel 68. There is also a daily radio net on this channel, see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/PortElizabeth%28Bequia%29?rc=ShoreServices#Communications">communications</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Theft from yachts is an on-going problem in this area, and has been for some five or six years. <span>Most incidents are similar, that is, while the crews are ashore for dinner or excursion the yacht is burgled - however some yachts have been boarded at night while people are asleep on board </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/date-2015-07-03-0430-country-name-svg-location-detail-bequia-princess-margaret-beach-event-attempted-theft/">(latest report of this nature July 2015)</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines periodically puts patrols in the area, but the patrols do not appear to remain in place for long.  That said, cruisers have reported spotting a small coastguard boat patrolling September/October 2015. </span></p>
<p>Be sure to close all hatches and <strong>LOCK</strong> your boat when going ashore, and secure any loose items on deck. It is even better if someone can remain on board.</p>
<p><strong><i>It is also advisable to lock the boat and hatches during the night whilst sleeping.</i></strong></p>
<p><span>Yachts should avoid anchoring within easy swimming distance of Princess Margaret Beach or the abandoned Plantation House Hotel. </span><span>See security reports adjacent.</span></p>
