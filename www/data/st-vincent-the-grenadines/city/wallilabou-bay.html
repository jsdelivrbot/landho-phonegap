<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on the NW coat of St Vincent, this picturesque bay is a good diving spot. The remains of the old film set for "Pirates of the Caribbean" can be seen here, however what is left is reported to be rather shabby and disappointing.</p>
<p>Located at 13° 15'N, 61° 17'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Wallilabou Bay is the first port of entry on the western side of St. Vincent for yachts arriving at St. Vincent from the north, particularly from Saint Lucia and Martinique. It is also the last port on that end of the island for departing yachts.</p>
<p>Some yachts have reported difficulty with officials here.</p>
<p>The Customs office is located at the restaurant and is open between 14:00 and 16:00 daily.</p>
<p>Immigration is at the Police station. Opening hours are hit and miss,</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are an abundance of boat boys here, wanting to help with handling lines. If you do not wish for help, just be polite.</p>
<p>In the past, some yachts have experienced thefts when anchored off the old film dock in the north side of the bay. A safer option is close to the Wallilabou Anchorage Hotel where they have a night watchman, however be sure to lock up your boat and all hatches and remove anything of value from the deck if going ashore.</p>
<p>The restaurant offers water, ice, showers, internet, and garbage service; and monitors VHF 68.</p>
