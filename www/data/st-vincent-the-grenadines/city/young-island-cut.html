<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at Young Island Cut, with its clear water, is a favourite place for yachts. However, cruisers recommend someone remaining on board if going ashore and a rotational watch during the night as a number of yachts were previously boarded here.</p>
<p>Position 13° 07'56"N, 61° 12'08"W (anchorage)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor with care as the current sweeps both ways and the centre of the cut is 65 feet deep. Moorings are available, but stay clear of the sea bed close to Young Island itself.</p>
<p>Call on  VHF channel 68 to enquire about a mooring buoy.</p>
<p>Help can be arranged for most things you need ashore and there are some local craftsmen.</p>
<p>Be sure to agree the rate before using a taxi.</p>
