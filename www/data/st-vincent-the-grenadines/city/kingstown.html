<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts should anchor at the new Kingstown Cruise Ship and Ferry Berth. First clear in with Customs and then Immigration, which is in town, and finally the Port Authority. This can take some time. Because of the lengthy formalities and difficult mooring in Kingstown.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is no comfortable docking here. A short stop at the ferry port is possible. It is not advisable to leave the boat unattended.</p>
<p><span>It may be better to clear in at Bequia and visit St Vincent on the ferry, which sails there daily.</span></p>
<p><span>A popular cruising boat anchorage is at Young Bay. </span></p>
<p><span>Fuel is available here and the provisioning is good.</span></p>
