<div class="hello"><div><p>There are plenty of anchorages in the bay, as well as stern-to berths at the Anchorage yacht Club, the Bougainvilla dock and at several other small docks. <span>Sail Grenadines may have a few moorings that should be reliable, but it is recommended not to use any others. </span><span>There is now a great new dinghy dock just outside the elegant L'Aquarium restaurant in the Bougainvilla complex.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The safety department at SVG Air strongly urges yachts to avoid the area within 2 miles of the airport's final approach area in Union Island. Parasailing activities south of the airport can cause difficulties to aircraft landing there.</p>
