<div class="hello"><div><p>Blue Lagoon is surrounded by palm trees and this area, with its lovely beach, provides a very pleasant anchorage. The marina and hotel have been completely refurbished during 2014 and is due to be fully operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong> - currently boats with a draft of 6.5ft or more cannot enter the marked channel at low tide.  The marina management are looking at addressing this in the near future.</p>

<p>This bay offers excellent shelter.</p>
<p>Moorings are sometimes available at the marina. There is also plenty of anchoring space here too and the marina dinghy dock is free of charge with security.</p>
<p>There is a bus stop just outside the marina entrance with buses into Kingstown ($2EC any journey). Here there is an excellent Saturday morning market.</p>
<p><span>Dinghy accessory thefts were reported here in April 2015 (fuel tank etc.) Be sure to secure all your valuables as you would anywhere in the world.</span></p>
