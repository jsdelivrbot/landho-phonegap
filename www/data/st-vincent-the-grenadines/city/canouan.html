<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying south of Mustique and north of Mayreau, in the middle of the Grenadine archipelago, Canouan is an island of only 5 square miles.</p>
<p>The island is "divided" in two. The northern portion is run by a large resort development exclusively for guests. The southern portion is for the locals, and is slowly developing from the sleepy village it once was with some larger concrete houses emerging. You will still find however it has a sleepy feel, with chickens and goats on the football ground.</p>
<p>The island has incredible beaches and great walks.</p>
<p><strong>Yacht Security</strong></p>
<p>Canouan suffered throughout the summer of 2015 when numerous boats were boarded in Charlestown Bay (18 to date) and the majority of these burgled. Cruising guide author Chris Doyle has confirmed that the thief has now been apprehended and jailed (see comment at bottom of page) which is good news for the island.</p>
<p>Following a winter of no reported incidents, a locked yacht was burgled again here whilst the crew were ashore in June 2016. See security reports adjacent.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Charlestown Bay</strong> is the main anchorage and you can anchor anywhere, except close to the Tamarind Beach Hotel which is full of moorings.</p>
<p>It can be uncomfortable here in strong NE winds with a northerly swell. Whilst holding is good in sand, the strong gusts coming off the hills can cause boats to swing all over the place and this can be worrying, especially with the wind howling all night. It can often be quite rough here.</p>
<p>The mooring buoys close to the shore belong to the charter fleet and are not available to visiting yachts.</p>
<p>Other moorings in the bay belong to Marcus and John, both provide a number of services to visiting yachts.</p>
<p>The pier at the Tamarind Beach Hotel can be used to come ashore in your dinghy, but use an anchor to keep your boat clear of the pier. With a swell running, it can be quite tricky to land on the dinghy dock safely. If landing on the beach, be aware that huge waves can appear from nowhere and somersault the boat.</p>
<p>The hotel welcomes cruisers and has WiFi and will sell you bread. Also boats will call to sell you fish, lobster, bread, water, ice and diesel.</p>
<p>If buying diesel be sure to filter it well - it is unlikely to be clean.</p>
<p>Moorings yacht charters have a new big dock here right next to the Hotel and there is also a small wooden dock in the southern part of the bay.</p>
<p>Yachts can also anchor in <strong>Rameau Bay.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is however no longer possible to anchor in <strong>Corbay </strong><strong>- a useful protected anchorage but now out of bounds due to new ownership (see comment at bottom of page).</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Anchoring and kite-surfing are also banned on the east side of Canouan.</span></strong></p>
<p>A new marina (The Glossy Bay Marina) was planned for the southern part of Canouan in 2007, however so far no development has taken place.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The safety department at SVG Air strongly urges yachts to avoid the area within 2 miles of the airport's final approach area.</p>
<p>On numerous occasions vessels have been crossing the final approach path at Canouan, at the same moment an aircraft is on its final approach. This poses a problem to both the aircraft and the yacht alike, especially at night or in low visibility. This is especially difficult for a pilot unfamiliar with the area.</p>
