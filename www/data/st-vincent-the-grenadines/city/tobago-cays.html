<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Tobago Cays Marine Park (TCMP)</strong></p>
<p>Lying just to the east of Mayreau, the huge Horseshoe Reef protects these desterted islets.</p>
<p>The Cays have been declared a wildlife reserve by the government and all visitors are urged to preserve and protect this unique natural resource. No fishing, jet skis, or anchoring of dinghies allowed.</p>
<p>For full details on the Tobago Cays Marine Park (TCMP) see their website <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.tobagocays.org/">http://www.tobagocays.org/</a></strong>, which includes rules and regulations, a zone map,latest fees and lots of useful information to make your stay here more enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Whilst this is a wonderful place to stargaze and enjoy the freedom of anchoring safely behind the huge Atlantic swell, sadly noonsite continues to receive reports from yachts that have been boarded, broken into and burgled at night, some incidents involving assault by armed men.</p>
<p>Cruisers should remember that popular anchorages in high season become secluded and isolated in<strong> </strong>"off-season" when few boats visit. Cruisers<span> are advised to anchor near other yachts and be more security conscious than they perhaps would otherwise have been. It is especially important to secure your boat at night, whether on board or not.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Some 30 moorings have been laid here, strategically placed to deter yachts from dropping their anchors too close to the turtle nesting area and the coral reefs. Use of these moorings is optional and the moorings are managed by the TCMP park rangers, who collect the fees at a rate of $45EC per night.</p>
<p>Warnings have been posted by cruisers in 2015 about the poor maintenance of these moorings. See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/StVincenttheGrenadines/view#1443149574246420"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in the cut between Petit Rameau and Petit Bateau with bow and stern anchors, as the current is strong. Holding is good.</p>
<p><span>Dispose properly of your debris, including the charcoal and remainders of your beach barbecue. (Local youths may offer to remove your garbage for a fee but avoid this temptation, as some are known to dump it without care.)</span></p>
