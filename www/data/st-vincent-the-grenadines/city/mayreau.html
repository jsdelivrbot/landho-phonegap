<div class="hello"><div><p>The main anchorage is at Saline Bay, but it can get busy here if a cruise ship is in.</p>
<p>Salt Whistle Bay, further to the north, is a beautiful anchorage with several beach bars and moorings for visiting boats. It is however popular with charter boats, so space is tight. The anchorage is in the north eastern part of the lagoon.</p>
<p><b>Security Note:</b> April 2016 - two charter guests were robbed by a man with a machete when returning to their boat in Salt Whistle Bay.</p>
