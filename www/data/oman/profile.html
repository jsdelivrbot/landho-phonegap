<ul>
<li>Most yachts visiting Oman are en route for the Red Sea; the route from India, 
particularly Bombay, passes very close to Raysut. Over the last few years trade 
from visiting yachts has declined due to the piracy problems, however when things 
improve the new marina facilities in the country deserve a visit.</li>
<li>Oman now recognises the benefits to be derived from tourism and many new tourist 
facilities have been developed in the past several years, mostly around the
Muscat area and in the country's interior.</li>
<li>Yachts are much more welcome now and can stop for a few days at Port Salalah, 
near the town of Salalah as well as Muscat, where there are good marina 
facilities.</li>
<li>The people are very friendly and hospitable, especially as few yachts call here.</li>
