            </h2>
<div><p>The port should be called on Channel 16 one hour before arrival. Normally permission will be given to enter the harbour and directions should be followed as to where to go for clearance.</p>
<p>On arrival boats are normally boarded by Quarantine, Immigration, Customs and Harbour officials.  No one should go ashore before formalities are completed. Passport and ship's papers are retained until departure.</p>
<p>Yachts can obtain a cruising permit from the Royal Oman Police (ROP) in the harbour at Mina Qaboos - it is issued from Jan 1st until Dec 31st - and costs 150 O.R. (Approx USD400).</p>
<p>Formalities for outward clearance are complicated and sufficient time should be allowed for them. All offices must be visited in turn, starting with police and finishing with the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>The official Guidelines are that vessels over 30 net tonnage are required to have a agent; under 30nt it is not required but may be an advantage. However, in reality (in particular in Salalah), <strong>all yachts</strong> are required to clear through an agent (see<strong> <a href="Members/val/R2011-02-27-1">Noonsite report</a> </strong>), and cannot "go it alone". This can be expensive.</p>

<p>The loss or theft of a passport can result in considerable difficulties because Omani law requires the traveller to report the loss or theft to the Royal Oman Police (ROP) and try to recover the passport by placing an advertisement in local newspapers.</p>
