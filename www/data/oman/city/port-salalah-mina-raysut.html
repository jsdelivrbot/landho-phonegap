<div class="hello"><div><p>Call Port Control on VHF 16 half an hour before entering harbour, they will advise about any big ship movements and direct you where to anchor. The Port Control officers track you on radar and make your course corrections for you. They will also notify the officials who will come to the boat.</p>
<p>The officials do not operate 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>It has been confirmed by the Port Captain that it is necessary to use an agent to deal with formalities here.</strong> See <a href="Members/val/R2011-02-27-1">Noonsite report</a> which contains a link to a list of official agents.</p>
<p>The Royal Oman Police will keep passports until departure; you are now expected to get visas (OR6 each) and pay a cruising fee (OR15 per yacht). You must present a clearance certificate from your previous port or face a fine of OR1500.</p>
<p>No longer allowed to pay Customs/Immigration fees by cash.</p>
<p>The authorities are reported to not be keen on yachts being left unattended while you travel inland or leave the country, so it is advisable to arrange for someone to keep on eye on the boat while you are away.</p>
<p>Agents also offer services to yachts such as helping obtain fuel and car rental (very useful for getting about); and also looking after the yacht if it is to be left.</p>
<p>All vessels calling at Port of Salalah should have a valid insurance policy covering <code>Wreck Removal</code> and <code>Third Party</code> liability. Vessels failing to produce correct insurance documents or having insufficient cover may be denied entry.</p>
