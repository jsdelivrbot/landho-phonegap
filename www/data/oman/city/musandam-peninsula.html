<div class="hello"><div><p>Geographically, the <strong>Musandam peninsula</strong> juts into the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entry into the Persian Gulf, from the Arabian Peninsula. It is an exclave of Oman, separated from the rest of the country by the UAE. Its location gives Oman partial control, shared with Iran, of the strategic strait.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="../../zighymarinaaerial.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Prior to 2008, access to the peninsular (other than by private yacht) was rather difficult, with the only options being limited flights or a ten hour drive through four immigration posts. The world's fastest passenger ferry service now runs between Muscat and Musandam to alleviate this problem and make the region more accessible.</p>
<p>The Zighy Marina is situated here on the SE coast of the peninsula. Previously run by ART Marine Marinas it is now independent. Zighy Marina is only 2 hours away from Dubai and is a 15 minute boat ride from Dibba Port, Musandam.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Zighy Marina has been designed to capture the spirit of indigenous Omani </span><span>heritage, which respects both the environment and the traditional architecture of Oman.
