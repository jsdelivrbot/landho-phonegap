<p><strong>Marina Bander Al Rowdha</strong>, whilst it welcomes visitors, is pretty much full with  permanent berth holders. Marina Manager Bob Looker  <strong><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:bob@marinaoman.net">bob@marinaoman.net</a> </strong>will however always ensure visitors can have a berth, but skippers should be aware  that if a yacht is much smaller than the long term berth available, it may be  necessary to pay for the size of the berth and not of the yacht, if one wants to  make sure that this berth would be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Jebel Sifah Marina</strong> (see photo) opened in February 2012. This is part of a resort and is situated around 30 km from downtown Muscat.</p>
<p>The new <strong>Almouj Marina</strong>, located within The Wave, is now welcoming visiting yachts  with 121 berths completed.</p>
