<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage area just east of Mt Hartman Bay and north west of Hog Island.</p>
<p>Entry is through the Mt Hartman buoyed channel, bear right before the green/red buoy.</p>
<p>This is a popular anchorage as there is a good beach on Hog Island and it's a short dinghy ride to Mt Hartman Bay and to Clarkes Court Bay and Lower Woburn for the bus to shopping downtown.</p>
<p>There are also numerous good snorkeling areas on the reefs surrounding this area.</p>
<p>Be aware of recent security scares in the area however.</p>
