<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Tyrell Bay</i>: This is a good, protected anchorage and is the one usually used by yachts. It has a good selection of restaurants/cafes as well as boatyard services, provisions and transport into town.</p>
<p><i>Hillsborough:</i> Not a particularly sheltered anchorage and subject to swell. Anchor away from the commercial concrete dock which is used by the ferries to Grenada and other islands. There is a dinghy dock on the south side of the concrete pier.</p>
<p><i>Sandy Island:</i> At the Sandy Island/Oyster Bed Marine Protected Area (SIOBMPA), which encompasses Sandy Island and the mangrove lagoon in Carriacou, an anchoring area has been designated and marked at the four corners with buoys, with the possibility of additional anchoring areas to come. The mooring balls have all been checked and renewed if necessary, and pick-up lines lengthened. Park rangers collect a $10 per day fee for staying here. Yacht with questions should contact SIOBMPA at <a href="mailto:siobmpa@gmail.com">siobmpa@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Yachtsmen are cautioned to check moorings for reliability.</p>
<p><span>Duty free fuel (Diesel &amp; Gasoline) plus water are available at the new fuel dock at the Boatyard on the south side of Tyrell Bay.</span><br/><span>Gas refills at the Shell Garage in Hillsborough.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Security - Tyrell Bay</b></span></p>
<p><b>June 2016:</b> <span>A dinghy/outboard hoisted on the port side was stolen overnight from an occupied yacht. It was not locked to the yacht.</span></p>
<p><b>December 2011:</b> An armed boarding and robbery took place, the first of its kind here (and thankfully nothing since). Read report <a href="../../../Members/sue/R2011-12-15-2"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
