<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The anchorage is deep (7-11m and rock bottom). The best holding is east of the docks. A better anchorage is across at PSV in front of the resort on a white sand bar in 3-5m.</span></p>
<p>On this small island, there is a bank, a post office, a health centre, a gas station (<span>B&amp;C Fuels for duty-free fuel)</span>, and a few grocery stores, all in close proximity to the main pier.</p>

<p>If dinning there, there are buoys in front of the Palm Beach restaurant.</p>
