<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/d49167b0236d4c35beb6bab7f0a77da7/@@images/image/mini"/>There are many anchorages as well as one marina and another one planned. There is a well bouyed channel leading into the bay.</p>
<p>Clarkes Court Boatyard and Marina (originally Clarkes Court Bay Marina), is under new management and the whole area is being re-developed. The area is being developed in 3 phases, with phase 1 (the Boatyard) near to completion. Boatyard services are now available (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Grenada/ClarkesBay?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyards</a></strong> for more details) and the marina area will be developed in phase 2 during 2016 (see photo taken May 2015).</p>
<p><strong>Security Note:</strong><span> Dinghy and outboard theft have been reported in this bay. Secure your valuables at all times, and if possible, raise your dinghy and outboard on deck at night and secure your boat from night-time boarders. Local police released two men who attempted to board a boat here at night in September 2014 and did not charge them. </span></p>
