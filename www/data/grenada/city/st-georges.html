<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two areas for anchoring in the St George's area: outside along the cliffs at Martins Bay and inside the Lagoon. The northern bay, the Carenage, is not available for non-commercial vessels.</p>
<p>The anchoring space inside the Lagoon is shrinking and the remaining "free anchoring" space in the northeast sector is crammed with local derelicts and other boats. There is room for a very few boats to anchor along what would be considered the entrance channel between Port Louis and the Grenada Yacht Club, but it tight.</p>
<p>One caution should be noted by anyone entering the Port Louis area of the Lagoon - there are large yellow bouys paralleling the long floating pier for use by large "Med-Moor" yachts. Navigating around and in between these bouys is tricky.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited Anchoring</strong><br/>It is prohibited to anchor in the Grand Anse Bay south of 12' 02.05' north latitude. Anchoring north of St. George's harbour entrance leading lights is also prohibited. Vessels anchoring off the Ross point area must display the appropriate lights after sunset.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><strong> Dinghy and outboard thefts continue to be reported here and incredibly many cruisers still leave their dinghies attached to their yachts unsecured. </strong>Outside the lagoon a number of thefts were reported in 2014 from yachts at anchor (both locked and unlocked), and again in May 2015. See reports adjacent. It is recommended if anchoring here to leave someone on board when leaving the boat.</p>
