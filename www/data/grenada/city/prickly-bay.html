<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concrete channel markers here are poorly maintained and may not be lit, so great care should be taken if navigating at night.</p>

<p>Customs and Immigration in Prickly Bay are in the group of buildings adjacent to Prickly Bay Marina. The office is open 7 days a week, 0900 to 1600 hours, and the officers are reported to be friendly. Note that Saturdays and Sundays are classed as "overtime" and extra fees are charged.</p>
<p><span>Customs and immigration require payment in EC dollars and it can be a long walk to the ATM, which is actually closer to Spice Island boatyard in the NW corner of the bay.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several good anchorages in this bay, though you may need a long scope in places. There are also plenty of swinging moorings available.</p>
<p>The bay is completely open to the south so some continual rolling due to swells can be expected.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>July 2016: An o<span>vernight an attempt was made to steal an outboard from a dinghy in the water. The outboard was locked to the dinghy which was locked to the yacht.</span></p>
<p>Dinghy thieves do operate in this area. Whilst noonsite has received reports in the past about unlocked dinghies being stolen, these were however subsequently recovered. Cruisers are <span>urged to be vigilant and to report any theft to the Coast Guard and the Police at once.</span></p>
<p><span>No dinghies have ever been reported as stolen from Prickly Bay Marina dock or jetty. The dinghy dock here is lit at night and has 24/7 security. The marina has an<span> emergency tender called "Rescue 1" in service 24/7 (call vhf ch.16 or 415 1132/415 1182) that can assist on stolen dinghy recovery or any other emergency.</span></span></p>
