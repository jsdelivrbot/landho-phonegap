<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two entrances through the reefs, one is well buoyed and easy, the other is difficult and should not be attempted unless you have done it before. Not recommended to try to enter this bay at night.</p>
<p>Once inside the harbour, you have the choice of anchoring, or docking at the marina. The marina option can expose you to very strong gusts that sometime come over the surrounding hills. In addition the marina is exposed to an uncomfortable light cross-chop that finds its way in from the sea.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant, quiet, and protected anchorage at the northeast arm of the bay, near the mangroves. Although usually uncrowded, this situation can change during the hurricane season when may boats move south.</p>
<p>Note: All the moorings in this bay are privately owned.</p>
