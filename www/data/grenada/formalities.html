<div><p>Passport must be valid for 6 months beyond your stay.</p>
<p>A visa is not required from citizens of the US, Canada, UK, British Commonwealth, Caribbean countries, most European countries, South Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>All others require visas, although a visa-free stay may be granted on arrival if continuing on to another destination within 14 days.</p>

<p>In recognition of Grenada’s popularity as a long term ‘base’ for yachts, Grenada Immigration has changed its policy on extension of visas for yachting visitors.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>A 3 month stay is now generally granted on arrival if requested, but this can subsequently be extended up to 12 months. Note that the first 3 months are free, however after that time the visa needs to be extended monthly with a monthly charge (see Fees below). <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></i></p>
<p>Once the 12 months period has been reached, there is now no requirement to leave and re-enter.  If Immigration are satisfied that the visitor has the means to leave should the need arise, and has not violated the terms of their visitor visa, they have the discretion to extend the visa for up to another 12 months if requested.  At this point another 12 month stay can be requested.</p>
<p>To obtain an extension, each crew member must present their passport to either the Immigration Officer at the main office, Botanical Gardens, St. Georges, or at the office in Hillsborough, Carriacou.</p>
<p>If you have crew leaving the boat and flying out of Grenada, visit the Immigration Officer prior to the day of departure and request the form for each person that is usually completed on an incoming flight. The stub of that form can be presented to Immigration at the airport at departure time. That form will be presented to the Immigration officials at the airport during departure processing. Grenada has a EC$50 per person (EC$25 if under age 12) departure fee at the airport. If you are flying in to return to your vessel be sure to have a copy of your vessel documentation and clearance papers to show at the airport, or if you are joining a vessel have a letter from the Captain of the vessel stating that you will be joining the vessel.</p>
<p>There is an embarkation tax of EC$20.  This is paid on departure by yacht, and is levied on each person aboard who is <strong>not</strong> ‘bone fida’ crew (i.e. passengers and those not involved in the operation of the yacht).  Typically this will not be levied on a cruising ‘couple’ running their yacht, but may be on any additional people on board at the discretion of the Immigration Officer.</p>

<div><p>Customs issue a monthly cruising permit (see fees below).</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared to Customs and will be sealed on board in a proper locker or kept ashore in custody until departure. A receipt will be issued by the police.</p>
<p>Medicines such as morphine in the medical stores must be declared.</p>
<p><strong>Importing Yacht Spares</strong></p>
<p>Foreign flagged yachts may import parts and equipment free of duty (Yacht In Transit). The parts are usually detained at Customs, or the post office, or the freight company warehouse and, to retrieve them, one needs to obtain a stamped form (C14) from the Customs office where one has cleared in.</p>
<p>If arriving by air, this will mean leaving your parts at the airport while you complete the paperwork and then returning to collect (unless you use an agent).</p>
<p>An invoice or bill showing the value of the goods (even if there is no charge to you i.e. warranty or replacement goods, including carriage) must be presented and Customs will charge a fee (about 2.5%, although it may be more) on the declared value.</p>
<p>For large or expensive items (over $3000 EC) a Customs agent is required to process the paperwork. Some of the boatyards will provide assistance and their agent to facilitate the clearance of your "Yacht in Transit" item.</p>
<p>Island Water World will also provide assistance clearing in "Yacht In Transit" items providing it is not an item that is normally sold within their stores.</p>
<p>Most chandleries and boat service companies will provide products and services at "duty free" prices if you present your ship's documentation and the Grenada Customs/Immigration papers you were issued upon arrival.</p>
<p>It can take between 3 to 14 days for the goods to actually be released.</p>

Grenada is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<div><p>Public nudity in Grenada is against the law. Local residents are concerned about nudity on yachts anchored close to the shore and cruisers are asked to respect the rules of Grenada society and keep their clothes on. </p>
<p>Yachts may not anchor in front of the hotels at the south end of Grand Anse Beach.</p>
<p>Lobster and spear fishing is prohibited without a licence, which is issued only to Grenadians. Lobster should only be bought in season (31 October to 30 April). </p>
<p>It is prohibited to pump bilge or waste into the water, and marine toilets may not be used within 200 metres of the beaches. There are toilets ashore at both marinas and the yacht clubs.</p>
<p>Yachts are urged to observe the 1.5 km exclusion zone around the undersea volcano Kick 'Em Jenny, located west of Isle de Ronde off Grenada's northwest coast (12.18°N 61.38°W). </p>
<p>The volcano continues to pose a threat to vessels.  During an eruption an exclusion zone of 5 km is enforced, ie all vessels should stay at least 10km west of Isle de Ronde.
