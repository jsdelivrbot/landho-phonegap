<div><ul>
<li>This is the southernmost of the Windward Islands and conveniently close to the Grenadines, which link Grenada to its smaller sisters Carriacou and Petit Martinique. </li>
<li>Grenada is the usual turning-point north for a cruise among the Windward Islands. </li>
<li>It is a beautiful island with lush mountains and silvery beaches and a series of wonderful bays along the southwest and south coasts. Grenada is  a sailors' favourite. </li>
<li>Carriacou is the southermost and largest of the Grenadines; relatively undeveloped, it is attractive with its green hills, sandy beaches, and sheltered natural harbours such as Tyrell Bay. <span>Carriacou Marine fuel dock has good prices for duty free fuel.</span></li>
<li>Petit Martinique also has duty-free fuel through <span>B&amp;C Fuels. This island</span> is not often visited by yachts cruising the popular nearby Grenadines (which belong to St. Vincent) as this means having to sail down to Carriacou to clear in and then sail back. Once you are checked into Grenada you can sail between the various islands of Grenada without restriction.</li>
<li><b>Getting work done:</b> Grenada has an excellent choice of good quality, reputable contractors. Several excellent chandleries too.</li>
<li><b>Provisioning:</b> Good choice and prices very reasonable. </li>

<p><strong>Hog Island</strong><br/><i>July 2016: </i><span>A cruiser was held at gunpoint and subsequently he and his wife suffered a terrible ordeal whilst walking his dog on Hog Island. </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Grenada/HogIsland/Countries/Grenada/grenada-hog-island-assault-and-kidnap-july-2016">See report here</a></strong><span>.</span><br/><b></b></p>
<p><strong>Prickly Bay<br/></strong><span><i>July 2016:</i> An attempt was made to steal a (in the water) dinghy and/or outboard engine, both of which were locked.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tyrell Bay - Carriacou<br/></strong><span><i>June 2016:</i> A dinghy/outboard hoisted on the port side was stolen overnight from an occupied yacht. It was not locked to the yacht.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mt. Hartman Bay:<br/></strong><strong><i>July 2016:</i></strong><span> </span><span>Between 5 and 8 July an unoccupied boat moored in Mt. Hartman Bay was broken into.

Currently, it is unknown what was actually stolen.</span></p>
<p><span></span>A female cruiser walking in the nearby Dove Sanctuary was a victim of attempted sexual assault in September 2015. See report <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Grenada/grenada-mt-hartman-bay-attempted-sexual-assault-september-2015"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>St. George's Outside Lagoon:<br/> </strong><span>A number of thefts were reported in 2014 from yachts at anchor here (both locked and unlocked). See</span><strong> <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Grenada/StGeorges/General/Piracy/grenada-st-george-s-outside-lagoon-theft-from-anchored-boats-august-2014">this report</a> </strong><span>for more details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Yacht Security Assistance in Grenada</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>24/7 yacht hotline</strong> now exists to report to the police crimes and suspicious activities, Tel. 473-405-7490.</p>
<p><strong>VHF Channel 66 Repeater</strong> was privately donated to the Grenadian Government and is used by the Grenada Cruisers Net to provide coverage to all Grenadian waters. It can also be received in southern parts of St Vincent and the Grenadines and the northern parts of Trinidad including Chaguaramas Bay. The Grenada Cruisers Net supplies weather, advice, and information on many subjects to help make Cruisers’ stay in Grenada more rewarding. Its broadcast each day at 7:30 AM.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue 1</strong> is a private rescue service of the Prickly Bay Marina, Grenada, and is on call 24 hours each day. As well as the rescue vessel it provides excellent liaison between cruisers, Police, Coast Guard, and other Authorities.</p>
<p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Yacht Security: Trinidad &amp; Tobago Waters</strong></p>
<p>During December 2015 two yachts, on seperate occasions, were boarded and robbed on passage from Grenada to Trinidad. All yachts transiting these waters should submit a float plan to the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Coastguard. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TrinidadTobago/Countries/TrinidadTobago/caribbean-yacht-security-new-protocols-and-arrangements-for-your-safety-when-transiting-near-trinidad-and-tobago/">this news report</a></strong> for more details. A similar incident occured once more in July 2016. See CSSN (<strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/date-2016-06-25-country-name-trinidadtobago-location-detail-trinidad-hibiscus-gas-platform-event-attempted-piracy/">www.safetyandsecuritynet.com</a></strong>) for more details.</p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</strong> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors.
