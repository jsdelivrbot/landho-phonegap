<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the largest port in Albania and lies on the northern edge of a large, shallow bay. The capital, Tirana, is about 20 miles east of the port.</p>
<p>If making a night entry note that the fairway buoy is unlit (August 2009) and the channel markers are just posts with very low intensity lights, very difficult to see against the town and harbour lights. It has been suggested that an easier approach is from due south of the entrance, just west of the commercial boat anchorage. The entrance is easy to identify from a distance as a gap in the very bright harbour lights.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania/?rc=Formalities">Albania Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed Clearance Information.</span></p>
<p>Call Port Control on channel 15 or 16, who will direct the boat to an area of the commercial harbour. Protection is very good but strong southerly winds may cause a surge to the inner basin.</p>
<p>The port captain may insist that a shipping agent is used to deal with formalities and, in fact, this is pretty essential to be able to successfully deal with the paperwork. It is recommended to contact the agent in advance. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong> for more details.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Several wrecks are located near the entrance channel to the Port so take care on the approach. <span>Follow the marked channel as far as the port entrance and go into the main commercial port. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Contact your agent in advance to arrange docking space in the port as there is no special area designated for yachts. On approach you will see a new small craft marina adjacent to the main port entrance, however this is currently closed. </span></span></p>
<p>The port walls for berthing are high and protected by very large tyres, so be prepared. <span> The quay is also quite dirty, covered in coal dust/ grain and as this is a working port it can be quite noisy. The Harbourmaster and dock staff are reported to be very helpful, however there are no specific</span><span> facilities here for yachts. </span><span>Security in the port is reported to be adequate. See comments below on available facilities for cruisers.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The town is good for supplies, but it can be difficult to find any repair facilities. </span></p>
<p>Your agent can arrange for diesel fuel and water from a truck as well  services to travel inland and security for the yacht.</p>
<p>Note: there is a fuel station across from the supermarket, just a few hundred metres from the port.</p>
