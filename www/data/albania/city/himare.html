<div class="hello"><div><p>The quay at <b>Himare</b> is concrete and very high. It doesn't offer good wind or swell protection. Yachts should check where to moor with the Harbour Master and may have to move if a fishing vessel requires the space.</p>
<p><span>A few kilometers south of Himarë along the Albanian Riviera is </span><span><b>Porto Palermo</b> (<span>25 nm north of Sarandë). This bay is</span></span><span> still used as a military base and yachs have reported not being able to berth here. </span><span>There is a high concrete pier just behind the small island/fort used by local fishing boats. If there is space yachts may be able to use it as well. There are no facilities here. T<span>here is a bay to the east of the entrance which offers good shelter for anchoring and some mooring buoys off the pier.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b>Warning</b> from <a class="external-link" href="http://www.sail-albania.com/157364010">http://www.sail-albania.com/157364010</a>: <br/><span>Porto Palermos is state owned and a free port. Beware of pirate agents acting illegally here.</span></span></p>
