<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania/?rc=Formalities">Albania Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed Clearance Information.</span></p>
<p>On entering Albanian waters, call the Port Captain on their working channel of VHF 15 or on 16 (he speaks English).</p>
<p>Proceed to the main Vlore port.</p>
<p><span>Orikum Marina may also be able to deal with clearance formalities, contact the Manager in advance to confirm.</span></p>
<p>At Vlore Port, arriving yachts are directed to a berthing point on the commercial dock for clearing in (most likely alongside a tug), and requested to come to the official offices on shore, located between the two jetties, to deal with formalities. Clearance is required with Port Captain and Police.</p>
<p>Officials here do prefer you to use the services of an agent (50-60 Euros). See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Albania Clearance Agents</a></strong> for details of the official Vlore agency.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that security here is poor and it is recommended to keep someone onboard when leaving the boat.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Vlore has a well-protected fishing harbour called Triport, now unfortunately badly silted up and impossible to enter by keel boat. It does not accept yachts. The entrance into nearby Vlore lagoon has also silted up, making access impossible.</p>
<p>Smaller than Durres, Vlore is busy with ferries to and from Italy and affords little shelter. Note that Vlore harbour is orientated around commerce with large rubber tyres as the harbour fenders on the commercial dock. Mooring here for clearance can be difficult due to the steel reinforcements which project from the piers. It is however possible to anchor<span> off the ferry port in 5m off the East pier.</span></p>
<p>In southerly or Westerly winds, it would not be a good place to be for too long.</p>

<p><strong>The Orikum Marina</strong>, at the south end of the bay, comes recommended by cruisers. This is part of a new apartment/hotel complex. Entrance into the marina from the north is difficult to visualise as it look as though one is sailing towards a brutish concrete wall, and only a sharp turn to port at the last minute has the marina entrance opening up. It may be advisable to check the entrance out by dinghy first. There is a green flashing light on a pole at the head of the low breakwater and a red flashing light on a red buoy to mark the port side channel limit.</p>
<p><span>The entrance channel to the marina is reported to be 2.7-3.0m deep. The manager is called Luigi, and is an Italian. Take care as the shallows are badly marked.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a good, sandy anchorage just E of the lighthouse off the headland opposite.</span></span></p>
<p>There are restaurants on the beach within walking distance, but the small township for any provisioning is about 3km away.</p>
