<div class="hello"><div><p>Saranda is a popular holiday destination for both Albanians and foreign tourists who come to visit the Roman ruins of Butrint. The town is developing fast and feedback from cruisers in 2016 has been very positive. Prices are very economical.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania/?rc=Formalities">Albania Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed Clearance Information.</span></p>
<p>This is Albania's southernmost port and a convenient place to clear in by boats coming from the south. Visitors are very welcome here.</p>
<p>Call the Port Captain on VHF 11 or VHF 16. They will direct you to a berth, if available, on the new ferry dock. Note however that this dock is very rough, and therefore once clearance is completed you may prefer to leave the dock and anchor, particularly if there is any surge entering the harbour.</p>
<p>Officials normally board the boat for clearance.</p>
<p>Use of an agent is necessary (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>) and if advised of your ETA and crew details, can arrange the necessary shore passes. These are all that are required as crew of a boat. It is likely the agent will be on the dock to meet you when you arrive. The agent's fee will include clearance costs and port fees.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The port gives good shelter in most weather, but it is open to the south and can be very exposed to swell. Plans to extend the breakwater should make this port more sheltered.</p>
<p>Anchor in the northern part of the bay, in sand, or where directed by the authorities. It is advisable not to leave the boat unattended whilst at anchor as children might swim out from the beach and climb aboard.</p>
<p>It is also possible to berth at the new ferry quay near the Port Authority and your agent can help arrange this. Note however that if winds are from the SW and the swell is bad, anchoring is preferable. The dock has recently been rebuilt, is in good shape and is very clean, however it is rough concrete and may cause concern if the boat is moving around too much. Moor bow or stern-to using your own anchor. <span>The depth at the dock is 4-6m. </span><span>Limited electricity posts on the dock (240V) and limited water. No public showers or toilets.</span></p>
<p>Security is good (24 hrs) and the ferry dock is close to everything. This would be a possible place to leave the boat if planning to travel inland.</p>
