<div class="hello"><div><p>This small fishing port is only 10 miles south of the border from Montenegro. There are shoals off the headland to the north of the harbour. It is busy for a short time during the summer, but for the rest of the year it is very quiet.</p>
<p><span>Position 41°48'47''N, 19°35'12''E.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania/?rc=Formalities">Albania Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed Clearance Information.</span></p>
<p>On approach, contact the Port Authority on VHF channel 16 and 71. They are not used to yachts and may allocate an unsuitable berth.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts need to use an agent for clearance here. See <a href="Countries/Albania?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Albania/Clearance Agents</strong></a> for a list.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour now has been dredged, so depth is not a problem. A new quay has been built, although the large ship fendering may be cause difficulties for smaller vessels. The port provides good shelter.</p>
<p><span>Security is good, but Note </span><span>that the gates to the port are locked at 2200hrs and no entry or exit is permitted after that.</span></p>
<p><span>Water and fuel can both be delivered by tanker. Berthing fees can probably be negotiated.</span></p>
