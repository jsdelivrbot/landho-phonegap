            </h2>
<div><p>According to reports, you may be approached by an Italian coastguard vessel when nearing the coast, as they patrol this area of the sea. While approaching Albanian territorial waters, Channel 11 should be monitored as it is the working channel used by the Albanian Coast Guard.</p>
<p>The port authority should be contacted on VHF radio (if possible) before entering any of the official ports. English (and Italian) are spoken by Port Control radio operators used to commercial shipping. The best facilities are at Durres which is Albania's main port and has regular ferry connections with Italy (Port Control VHF Channel 15). Officials will board the boat on arrival.</p>
<p>At the majority of ports the Port Authorities (Captain and Police) may insist that an agent is used for entry/exit. This now also applies at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Albania/Vlore">Vlore</a></strong>, where you will not be given permission to enter at Orikum Marina and will have to first clear at the commercial port.</p>
<p>When you leave the port you must get another Clearance paper to hand to the subsequent Port Captain on arrival.</p>
<p>Each port will require several copies of the crew list; copies of the Ship’s Registration Papers are also useful.</p>
<p>For a list of agents at Durres and Saranda, see <a href="Countries/Albania/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Clearance Agents</strong></a></p>

<p>Boats sailing south to Saranda through the Bay of Porto Palermo will pass through a military zone for which permission must be obtained.</p>
<p>It has been reported August 2009 that there seem to be few, if any, restrictions on travel now. Cruising yachts leaving Saranda were told they could anchor anywhere except Sazanit Island.</p></div>
