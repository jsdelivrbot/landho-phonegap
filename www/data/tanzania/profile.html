<ul>
<li>In line with a general opening up of the country to tourism, cruising yachts are now welcome to all parts of the country and even areas which were closed in the past, such as Pemba Island, are now accessible by sea. The underwater scenery and marine life are of comparable beauty to the spectacular interior of the country.</li>
<li>The main attractions inland are the game parks, such as the Serengeti or Ngorongoro, which can be visited by leaving the yacht in the care of one of the yacht clubs. Both the Dar es Salaam and Tanga Yacht Clubs are particularly welcoming to visiting yachts. </li>
<li>Theft is a problem and a yacht should be properly watched at all times. In Dar es Salaam this applies during the day as well as at night and it is not recommended to stay in the inner harbour longer than it takes to complete clearance.</li>
<li>Provisions are sometimes in short supply. Occasionally there are temporary water shortages due to power failures and all water should be treated and possibly filtered as well. Some simple repairs are possible in the bigger ports, but any spares must be flown in from abroad.</li>
