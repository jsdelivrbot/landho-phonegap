<div class="hello"><div><p>A small lazy township, 60 kilometers South of the Kenyan border. The town of Tanga is provincial compared to Dar es Salaam, but one can find every thing neccessary and it is the best place in East Africa for provisioning, if one plans to sail for Chagos.</p>
<p>Nestling on the southern side of the bay is the Tanga Yacht Club, a relaxed and friendly, family oriented Club which provides a superb, safe anchorage for yachts all year round. This is the most secure place for leaving your yacht and
going on safari or flying out of the country. </p>
<p>Position 05°03'S, 039°07'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is usually the first port of entry into Tanzania if coming from the north, and a popular place to obtain clearance. Smaller than Dar es Salaam, the offices are closer together and the officials less busy. </p>
<p>Tanga Signal Station maintains a 24 hour watch. On entering Tanga Bay contact Tanga Signal on channel VHF 12 or 16. Captain C.J.E. Pearson, Harbour Master, Harbour Pilot and Commodore of Tanga Yacht Club will advise yachts on procedure during office hours. </p>
<p>Customs formalities are completed at the office on Dhow Wharf, beyond the commercial wharf. They are open between 0800 hrs until 1600 hrs, five days a week. You will need Clearance Papers from your last country of departure and a crew list for Customs.</p>
<p>Immigration is located in the center of Tanga town, close to the post office. Hours are from 0800 hrs to 1600 hrs. Monday through Friday, closed Saturday, Sunday and public holidays. For Immigration you will need a valid passport. Visas can be obtained from Immigration for a fee. Fee structure depends on your nationality.</p>
<p>Transire: If you have already checked into Tanzania, a Transire from your last Tanzanian port is required by Customs. If you have already cleared into Tanzania, checking in with Immigration is not required.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The yacht club in Tanga has made many improvements for visiting yachts and is very welcoming to visitors. Visiting yachts pay 10 Euros per week, for use of the facilities and a secure dinghy dock. There is now the possibility for drying out on careening poles, although it is wise to bring ones own antifouling, as Tanzania itself produces only low quality paint.</p>
<p>The main anchorage is protected in a monsoon, and safe security wise according to visiting cruisers. </p>
