<div class="hello"><div><p>This deep-water port is located 35nm north of the border with Mozambique. After some years of neglect, the port and town are now experiencing a period of regeneration. The port can take ocean-going vessels and there are plans to expand its commercial operations.</p>
<p>Position 10° 15'14"S, 40° 11'37"E (port entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is possible to obtain clearance here, but finding a suitable place to land in a dinghy can be difficult. Security at the wharf in the port is very tight, and landing there may not be possible.</p>
<p>The officials at Customs and Immigration are reported to be very friendly.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are no yacht berths here and the two available mooring buoys should be used only with caution. If possible, check how secure they are first.</p>
<p>The recommended anchorage is off the wharf in the commercial port, but take care to keep out of the large ships which use it.</p>
<p><i>Mikiandi</i>: This bay is just 2 miles away and is recommended in some pilot books. It is an attractive and a secure anchorage, but the bay is large, and it is necessary to moor a long way from the shore. There is no safe place to leave a dinghy.</p>
