<div class="hello"><div><p>Stone Town, also known as Mji Mkongwe (Swahili for "old town"), is the old part of Zanzibar City, the main city of Zanzibar, in Tanzania. (The newer portion of the city is known as Ng'ambo, Swahili for 'the other side'). Stone Town is located on the western coast of Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago.</p>
<p>The port here is busy with ferries and shipping and anchoring can be uncomfortable.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts travelling to Zanzibar must visit Immigration and have passports stamped, even if having already completed clearance on mainland Tanzania. A transit log must be obtained from the mainland ports (Dar, Tanga, Mtwara) before entering Zanzibar as it may be inspected.</p>
<p>In Stonetown, passports can get stamped with Immigration at the ferry dock. Go to Customs there as well for your transit log inspection.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor in 15m. Dinghies can be left on the small beach in front of the Mercury Bar, where for a small tip one of the bar guards will keep an eye on it. Take care with the tides and be sure to haul the dinghy far enough up the beach.</p>
<p>The staff at the Mercury Bar can help with finding a taxi.</p>
