<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour needs to be entered in a good light due to the number of coral heads in the anchorage area. The entrance channel is well marked.</p>
<p>The best dinghy access is by the <span>Bluebird Hardware store, adjacent to the pink shop.</span></p>
<p><span>Provisions, banks, hotels and restaurants can all be found here but are fairly spread out.</span></p>
