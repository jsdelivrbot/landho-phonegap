<div class="hello"><div><p>Apia is the only city in Samoa and lies in a natural harbour at the mouth of the Vaisigano River on Upolu's north coast. It is the only clearance port for Samoa.</p>
<p>Position 13° 49'42" S, 171° 45'45" W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See<strong> <a href="Countries/Samoa/?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Samoa/Clearance</a> </strong>for full details.</p>
<p><span>Before entering the harbour, call Apia Port Control on VHF channel 16 or 14.  <span>It may take several calls to get a response. You will be directed to anchor at the head of the bay (21 feet mud, decent holding). The anchorage can easily accommodate a dozen or more boats and is very well protected.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The choice here is to remain in the anchorage or to move to the marina.</p>
<p><strong>Marina</strong></p>
<p><span>Apia Marina has two pontoons, however only one is available for visiting yachts (the other one full of local boats). There are approx. 22 berths available and so limited space. </span></p>
<p><span>The pontoons are </span><span>floating</span><span> concrete fingers with rubber guards fitted.  All in good condition</span><span> with power and water at every berth. Draft in the marina is limited to 2.3m.</span></p>
<p>The marina is owned and run by Trevor and his business partner who have a 60 year lease. Trevor is Samoan and went to school in New Zealand so speaks perfect English. However, he is the only certified diver on the island and is very busy so is not often to be found at the marina office.</p>
<p>Cruisers have reported that there is <span>no security at the marina, not even a locked gate, so be sure to secure your belongings and your dinghy.</span></p>

<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>Larger yachts, or those with a deep draft, need to anchor in the harbour and pay port fees. It is perfectly legal for all yachts to anchor in the harbour (as long as you are not interfering with port operations), however cruisers have reported that it does tend to be discouraged if there is space in the marina.</p>
<p>For latest fees for anchoring see comments at bottom of page.</p>
<p>The harbour is clean and the marina, although subject to some swell, is well sheltered.</p>
<p><span>For information on anchoring elsewhere see </span><a href="Members/sue/R2010-09-14-3"><strong>Savaii Island Anchorages</strong></a><span> and SV Outsider Australia's excellent </span><a href="images/pdfs/samoa-cruising-guide-2014-15/"><strong>Cruising Guide to Samoa</strong></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong></p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock in the marina, next to the ramp, which anchored boats can use for a <span>fee of $50 per week.  This allows use of the dinghy dock and </span>shower &amp; toilet plus garbage disposal.</p>
<p>If at anchor, the <span>Port's "dinghy access" is probably more convenient and included in the anchoring fee, located just inside the area where the port tugs are docked.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Facilities Ashore</strong></span></p>
<p><span>All garbage must be put into sealed plastic bags.</span></p>
<p><span>See the <a href="Countries/Samoa?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Samoa/fees</strong></a> section for the details.</span></p>
<p><span>The building facing the marina houses four restaurants/bars, all playing music until the early hours at weekends and on Wednesdays.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ensure that rat guards are fitted to mooring ropes as those in the port have learnt to climb them. Ensure there are none aboard your boat before moving on.</span></li>
<li><span>Charts for anywhere but the north coast are not to be relied upon as accurate.</span></li>
</ul>
