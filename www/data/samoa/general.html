      Ian and Wendy of SY Outsider Australia arrived in Samoa in November 2014 and spent the wet season there. After finding very little information, for cruisers, was available, they created this guide as they cruised. Includes 20+ anchorages as well as up to date port information.<br>
Note: large file to download.
