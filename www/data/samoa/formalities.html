<div><p><strong>Note on International Date Line: </strong><span>Since 2011, Samoa has been on the New Zealand side of the International Date Line. If you arrive from the Cook Islands or French Polynesia you will skip a day. None of the cruising guides mention this, but as the Samoan authorities do not clear boats at the weekend, it is worth planning for. American Samoa, however, is still on the French Polynesian side of the Date Line.</span></p>
<p>Noonsite has now been advised that <strong>it is necessary</strong> to give 48 hours prior notice of arrival. This can be done by emailing <a href="mailto://portmaster@spasamoa.ws">portmaster@spasamoa.ws</a> or <a href="mailto:spa@spasamoa.ws">spa@spasamoa.ws</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Samoa/Apia">Apia</a> </strong>is the only official port of entry on Samoa.</p>
<p>Call the Apia harbour master on VHF Ch. 16 when 1 or 2 hours away and they will give permission to enter the harbour. You may need to try several times.</p>
<p>Do not go alongside the main wharf, or drop anchor, until permission and directions are given by harbour control. <span>If arriving at the weekend, clearance will take place on Monday, but Port control will advise on protocols. It is also not possible to clear in the evenings.</span></p>
<p>Officially you must contact each clearance department (Customs, Immigration and Quarantine) separately via the Samoan Government website which can be found here: <strong><a href="http://www.samoagovt.ws/">http://www.samoagovt.ws/</a>.</strong></p>
<p>However, in reality, you may find after contacting Port Control, they will contact all the authorities on your behalf and arrange for them to come to your boat for clearance. Be patient, as you may find that they all arrive separately. You may have to go into town to visit Immigration ($5 tala taxi ride).</p>
<p><i><strong>Notice September 2013:</strong> Cruisers report that d<span>rug searches are being stepped up in Apia. If you arrive in Apia with clearance from a Central or Southern Americas port, Officials will search your boat. Also, if Apia is not the named destination on your clearance they will search you. The searches can last all day and involve more than ten persons and two drug dogs.</span></i></p>
<p>See  <a href="Countries/Samoa/?rc=Formalities#Restrictions"><strong>Restrictions</strong></a> for controls on anchoring.</p>
<p>If you want to leave the boat at the marina while you fly home, give yourself enough time, as you need to apply in writing for permission and wait until it has been granted.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">International yachts entering Samoa waters are considered to be of a high biosecurity risk and are closely monitored by Quarantine. It is important to be aware of the clearance procedures for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The skipper must complete a Master’s Declaration Form declaring all biosecurity risk items on board that are either restricted or prohibited.</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong><i>Items to declare include: </i></strong></span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Foods (tinned/packed), including meat, sausages, salami, ham, poultry, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, honey etc;</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Plants or parts of plants (live or dead) including vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, bulbs, flowers (fresh or dry), mushrooms, straw, bamboo or any other articles made of plant materials;</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Animal products including feathers, fur/skin, shells, hatching eggs.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">All refuse generated on the vessel must be placed in a suitable leak-proof container, with a lid, and the container is securely fastened at all times and kept aboard the yacht. The refuse can only be removed from the yachts under the directions of the Quarantine Officer and costs<span> $4 Samoan dollars (Tala) per bag to drop off at the Quarantine office</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Clearing Out</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong>It is important to clear out of Apia, even if you plan to visit other anchorages (for which you MUST have a Cruising Licence). Your clearance date can be several weeks or more ahead of the date you actually leave Apia. A letter from Immigration is needed to confirm the date of finally leaving Samoa.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>This requires a visit to the Immigration Office which is in town (taxi ride $5 tala). Take your passports. This office is very crowded. Do not take a number, instead ask at the desk "where do ship captains get clearance?". You will be shown into a back room to complete the paperwork.</p>
<p>Then go to the Customs Office to obtain clearance.  A clearance fee is payable at the Customs Office, so it's important to arrive no later than 2pm as the cash office closes at 4pm.</p>

Samoa is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to the CDC’s dedicated website if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<p>Cruising Permits can also be obtained in advance. Write to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, PO Box L 861, Apia and send a copy to the Secretary for Transport, PO Box 1607, Apia. The letter should state the yacht's name, port of registry, the names and nationalities of the master and crew, ETA Apia, and a list of places one intends to visit, plus planned duration of stay.</p>
<p>On outward clearance it is possible to get permission to stop in Asau on Savai'i, before continuing on to other destinations, but be sure your Clearance document states the actual date of your departure for Samoan waters.</p></div>

<div><p>There are no fees for clearing into Samoa.</p>
