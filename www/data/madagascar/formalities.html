<div><p>On approach, fly the 'Q' flag. Do not bother to call via VHF as the officials usually do not have working radios.</p>
<p><span>Officials do not come to the yacht and it is necessary to visit the relevant offices (Port Captain, Police, Immigration, Customs and Health) for clearance. Speaking French may be an advantage. However, some officials do know a little English.</span></p>
<p>On entry, the following information will be required: point of departure; itinerary; crew and passengers; a port of call authorization issued by nearest office of Service de la Marine Marchande; date of entry in and exit from Malagasy territorial waters.</p>
<p>It is necessary to both clear in and out at each port visited.</p>
<p>On leaving a port; ensure that you have an outward Clearance document and also a <span>"Permis de Circulation".</span></p>
<p><span>Officials, apart from being slow and not always reliable, are </span><span>normally not a problem. However, see the <a href="Countries/Madagascar?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>fees</strong></a> section on dealing with payment requests.</span></p>
<p><span>No agent is required.</span></p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months beyond your departure date.</p>
<p><span>It is no longer possible to get a free 30 day visa on arrival. </span></p>
<p><span>For stays of up to 90 days, visas are available on arrival. Fees are as follows:<br/></span><span>Ariary 80,000 for a stay not more than 30 days;<br/>Ariary 100,000 for a stay between 30 days and 60 days; and Ariary 140,000 for a stay between 60 and 90 days. </span></p>
<p><span>After 90 days no visa extensions are possible. You will have to check out and do a run to Mayotte and on return can get 3 months again.</span></p>
<p>For those sailing to Madagascar from neighbouring countries and wanting to stay longer than 90 days, a visa in advance is required. The most convenient places to obtain a visa from a Malagasy consulate are the Seychelles, Mauritius, Réunion or Tanzania. The visa application form is available at <strong><a href="http://www.madagascar-consulate.org/visainfo.html">http://www.madagascar-consulate.org/visainfo.html</a></strong></p>

<div><p>In some parts of Madagascar, aspects of daily life are regulated by taboos,  known as fady. These vary from one region to another. Fady can range from  forbidden foods to restrictions in clothing. Some areas subject to fady may be  forbidden to foreigners, but these are mainly in remote parts of the country.
