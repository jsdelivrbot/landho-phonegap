<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/3e545c81660249ebb3915dee0021a8dc/@@images/image/mini"/>Located on the NW tip of Madagascar, Nosy Hara is <span>20 miles from <span>Antsiranana</span> and 75 miles from Nosy Be. </span></p>
<p><span><span>The Nosy Hara archipelago is made up of about 12 small islands surrounded by coral reef and is <span>one of the first large-scale marine protected areas in Madagascar.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Half the islands are made up of unique Malagsy 'tsingy' ecotype, producing cliffs and crags of weathered limestone popular with climbers. The other half are sand. Four of the islands (Nosy Hara, Nosy Lakandava, Nosy Anjombovola, and Nosy Andranzara) have forest growing amongst the crags inhabited by endemic birds, frogs and lizards.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Nearby Nosy Hao is also worth a visit, with an abundance of sea turtle from March to August (the largest population in Madagascar) and wonderful views at low tide.</span></span></p>
<p><span>There are 2 rangers living on Nosy Hara who have carved paths into the jagged rock for visitors. </span></p>
<p><span><span></span>Noonsite has been informed that a new yacht facility is under development here on the mainland next to Nosy Hara, just a couple of hours drive from Diego. See details below. </span></p>
<p><span>Position 12° 13'S, 45° 0'E (approx, N end of the island)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Nosy Hara</strong></p>
<p><span>Nosy Hara has high cliffs, which help shelter the anchorage. During the</span><span> Varatraza wind (east and south-east wind) the west side of the island offers protection and when you have the Talio wind (west wind) the east of the island offers protection (only in the summer).</span></p>
<p><span>The anchorage is quite small, but spectacular. Cruisers visiting in 2014 reported that if you go ashore, the rangers will ask for a daily fee of approx. $4 per person. Take care ashore as the<span> limestone rock has been carved by wind and rain into razor sharp rocks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>New Yacht Facility</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Tucked inside of Nosy Hara on the mainland (see map) is a new facility for visiting yachts. <span>No anchoring is permitted here, however mooring buoys are provided. Google Maps showing location have been provided by </span><span>Guillaume Pignol </span><span>from Nosy Hara.</span></p>
<p>Port added September 2014.</p>
