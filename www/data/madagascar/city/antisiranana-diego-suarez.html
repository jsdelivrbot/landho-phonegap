<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Be aware that your electronic chart position may be not correct. Some can be over half a mile out! Eyeball navigation is essential.</span></p>
<p><span>It is easy to enter the large bay through it's eastern channel, but  it is can be very hard to leave. The current, wind, and waves entering the bay will test most sailors trying to exit the bay. However, if you can pick your weather window a difficult departure can be avoided.</span></p>
<p>Anchoring in here should be done with extreme care as there are a number of unmarked wrecks, particularly after last cyclones in 2008 and 2009.</p>
