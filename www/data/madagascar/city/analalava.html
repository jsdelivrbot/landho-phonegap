<div class="hello"><div><p>Analalava lies approximately 100nm SW of Nossi-Be and 150nm NE of Mahajanga. It is quaint, ex-colonial town and was once a flourishing place serving the local penal colony on Nosy Lava, which closed in 2000. Now it has the air of an empty film set with many old French style buildings.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage off the town but it is exposed and a long way from the shore at low tide.  A better anchorage is up the river on the starboard side near an abandoned ferry ramp.  ( GPS 14° 36.79'S, 47° 45.69'E) The river is very deep and the anchorage shoals rapidly, so care is required to position the anchor accurately. However, once set there should be no problems.</p>
<p>The dinghy landing is to port of the ferry ramp and from here it is a about a 30 minute pleasant walk along the old ferry road to town.</p>
<p><span>The Malibu Hotel on the beach does excellent food and can help with problems.</span></p>
