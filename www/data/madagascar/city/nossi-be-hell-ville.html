<div class="hello"><div><p>Nossi (or Nosy) Be is a small island on the west coast of Madagascar, close to its northern tip. It is well know for its beaches.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Check the latest travel advice. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/madagascar"><strong>FCO website</strong></a>. You should be particularly vigilant in the following areas of Nosy Be: Ambatoloaka, Hell-Ville, all beaches, and the road to the airport.</p>
<p>There have been recent attacks on <span>tourists visiting the National Parks Montagne d’Ambre and Ankarana.</span></p>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor off the main dock and call at the Port Captain's office (often close Saturdays and always on Sundays). He will ask for a fee (64,00 Ar, about $19) to issue a local cruising permit (a <span> "Permis de Circulation"). No other port has such a permit and it is only issued to foreign yachts.</span></p>
<p>To clear in, it is necessary to visit the relevant offices (Port Captain, Police, Immigration, Customs and Health). They are based in the building next to the catholic church. Speaking French may be an advantage.</p>
<p>It may be possible to anchor in Crater Bay and take a taxi into Hell Ville (cost about US$19). If you admit to officials that your yacht is there and not in the harbour (they cannot see the yachts from their offices), they may try and insist on you paying a fine.</p>
<p>First call on the Immigration police in the portacabin inside the port about 20 yds from the slipway. A small fee is payable but ask for a receipt before handing over any money. Then go to the Port Captain's office. This is outside the port, 100 yds up the road on the corner of the 1st RH bend (closed 1200-1500). He requires a copy of boat registration and will try and get you to pay your port fees in advance at the port cashiers (office 50 yds away). Insist that you will pay your port fees on check-out. GET A RECEIPT.</p>
<p>You need to check in/out each province visited. This involves getting a crew list stamped by the Immigration police, then taking it to the Port Captain to get clearance. There is a stiff fine for not doing so.</p>
<p>Do not pay the Immigration police a fee on check out. It is not required and the Hellville police can confirm this.</p>
<p>If a visa on arrival is required, you will be directed to a government office near the Champion supermarket.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring is the only option. In spite of any plans, no marina has been built here. Crater Bay is the preferred anchorage.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be left at the public jetty in the care of a boat boy. One recommendation is Ja’afardine (Phone 0322830401). He  speaks some English, has a printed introduction and seems more businesslike than the rest. He can also arrange the delivery of fuel from a local service station.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crater</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bay</span></strong>:</p>
<p>There are many yachts here, mostly local. Ashore there is a small yacht club with a landing stage for dinghies. There is a small bar/restaurant built on an old cane railway locomotive. It is a 20 minute walk to the local town where there is a good small supermarket. Some chandlery is available. Only cash can be used and there is nowhere to change money except possibly at a nearby resort. Potable water is available.</p>
<p>It might be advisable to bring outboards on board at night.</p>
<p>Sakatia Island (near Hell-Ville), 13 deg 18.06S and 048 deg 10.63E, has good holding in 4-6m in sand.</p>

      Des &amp; Nell of SY Gambit (and the ex-Madagascar relay station for the Peri-Peri Net) used to be based on Sakatia Island (near Hell-Ville). They have now returned to South Africa, but are happy to continue offering advice to cruisers visiting Madagascar. They have sailed the country extensively and welcome the opportunity to stay involved in the well being of fellow sailors.
