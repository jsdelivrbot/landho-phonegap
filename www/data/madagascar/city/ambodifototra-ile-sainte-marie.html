<p><span>The port and main town of Ambodifototra is located on the sheltered southwest side of the island.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The channel between Nosy Boraha and Madagascar is a popular place for </span>whale watching, as s<span>ubstantial groups of </span>humpback whales <span>migrate from the </span>Antarctic here to breed.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>This an official port of entry.</p>
<p>See <a href="../?rc=Formalities"><strong>Madagascar/Formalities</strong></a> for full details of Clearance procedures.</p>
<p>On request, you may be granted a 3 month visa rather than the usual 1 month one when clearing in here, but visa extensions cannot be granted at this port.</p>
<p><span> Clearance is reported to only take a couple of hours. Dinghies can be safely tied up in the ferry port at the small wooden dock with a corrugated roof. It's advisable to use a stern anchor for the dinghy.</span></p>
<p><span>From the dinghy dock take the road next to the bakery "Choco Pain". The Police are 200m up this road on the right. </span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Port Police are on Ilot Madame, take the dinghy to the derelict concrete dock in front of the old colonial style building with brown columns. Again, use a stern anchor.</span></p>
