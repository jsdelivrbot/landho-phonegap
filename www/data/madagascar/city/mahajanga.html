<div class="hello"><div><p>Mahajunga (<span>also known as Majung)</span><span> lies on the north west coast of Madagascar and is its </span><span>second largest port</span><span> </span><span>and the closest clearance port to the Cap Saint Andre where cruising boats typically jump to cross the Mozambique channel. </span></p>
<p><span>It provides a safe harbour for domestic and foreign fishing fleets. Local trading schooners and dhows are thick on the water at sunrise and sunset as they carry cargo to coastal towns and cities.</span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security:</span> </b><br/>Because of the large amount of boat traffic in the harbour, the potential for theft exists. Several years ago some yachts were boarded and theft or attempted theft was carried out, the most worrying incident can be read in detail at: </span><a href="Members/doina/R2007-11-02-1"><strong>Piracy incident Majunga Madagascar SE Indian Ocean</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>With careful security planning however, this harbour can be visited if the boat is anchored away from the port. </span><span>Mahajunga is an option if wishing to explore inland (Marovoay, the Reserve Forestiere d'Ampijoroa, the Parc National d'Ankarafantsika, or the capital, Antananarivo) and guardinage can be arranged.</span></p>
<p>Position 15°43′S, 46°19′E.</p></div></div>

It is reported to be quick and easy.</span></p>

      Maurice Tianjara. A good place to clear out as less bribes are requested than in Hell-Ville.

It is VERY busy with local fishing and trading boats. It is possible to anchor off the eastern end of the commercial wharf, but this is rather exposed.</p>
<p>Another option is close in to Schneider Bay as possible, (GPS  15deg 42.91’ S  46deg 17.79’ E) right on the edge of the shallows. The bay itself is too shallow for mooring except for a cat. This position is close to a mooring buoy used by oil tankers  but they tie up between the buoy and the mole so there is no problem. From here there is a small beach where you can land a dinghy and pay 5000 Ar as a minding fee. It is a 3000 Ar taxi ride to town.</p>
<p>Do not anchor near Point de Sable as shown in "East Africa Pilot"; you will be told to move.</p>
<p>The sleepy village of Katsepy<i> (see photo courtesy of SY Totem)</i> is five miles across the mouth of the delta from Mahajanga’s inner harbor. <span>The village is a terminus for bush taxis to drop passangers to be ferried to Mahajanga. This is an <span>easy and convenient place to provision and fuel (by jerry can from a gas station near the harbour via tuktuk). There are 2 <span> two well stocked supermarkets walking distance from the waterfront.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The river delta here is extremely muddy.</span></span></span></p>
