<p><strong>Lochs and Lights: The West Coast of Mainland Scotland</strong><br/> By Patrick Roach and Gordon Buchanan<br/> Publisher Imray,Laurie,Norie &amp; Wilson Ltd (1 Jun 2010)<br/> ISBN-13: 978-1846231698<br/> This addition to the range covers the mainland part of the West coast of Scotland, one of the most attractive sailing areas in the British Isles.

These wonderful views from the air give an idea of the drama and variety in the long and complex Scottish coast, and for anyone at sea as well as walkers and other landside visitors, Lochs and lights is the ideal companion.</p>
