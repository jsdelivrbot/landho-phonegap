<div class="hello"><div><p>The inner harbour has been dredged and a new marina installed at the northern end of the inner harbour.</p>
<p>Contact the Harbour Master' office in advance to<i> </i>ascertain<i> </i>berth availability prior to arrival.</p>
<p><span><b>One hour</b> prior to arrival, contact the Harbour Master on VHF channel 12.</span></p>
<p>A small anchorage is available between Goat Island and the RO-RO pier. Protected from north wind through easterly to southeasterly.</p>
<p>Glumaig Harbour, approximately 1nm south of the marina, provides a good, sheltered anchorage, although more open to the north. Beware of the fairway that leads into this anchorage.  Ships still come occasionally to the fabrication sheds of Arnish.</p>
<p>The inner harbour has no room for anchoring and all the mooring buoys are private.</p>
<p>For information on visitors' mooring buoys available throughout the southern part of the Western Isles, see this map of<strong> <a href="http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/harbourmaster/moorings/index.asp">visitors'  moorings</a></strong></p>
