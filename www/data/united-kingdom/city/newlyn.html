<div class="hello"><div><p>Newlyn does not have a permanent berthing facility, although it does have finger pontoons usually available for visiting yachts for up to a week or more (if needed) with all tide access. Can be a bit roly in strong S to ESE winds
as the Harbour entrance is open in that direction, and the bay is exposed to
a long fetch from this quarter.</p>
<p>A useful port of refuge, however fishing boats always have priority here.</p>
<p>In offshore winds, anchor 200m north-east of Newlyn entrance in Gwavas Lake in depths of around 2m. </p>
