<p>The only berthing on the Tay is at Tayport Harbour. Although a drying harbour, the bottom is soft mud into which boats can settle. The harbour is on <span>the south side of the River Tay, opposite Broughty Ferry castle.</span></p>
<p><i>Anchorages</i><br/> There are several possible anchorages, depending on the wind direction. The first just by Broughty Castle which can be exposed.</p>
<p>Between the two bridges, there may be one off the northern bank, close west of the road bridge, but currently there is building work in this area. Off the southern bank there is an anchorage (with mooring buoys for smaller boats) near Woodhaven and another near West Newport. As both these anchorages are after the bend in the river, they are better protected from swell during onshore winds from the North Sea.</p>
