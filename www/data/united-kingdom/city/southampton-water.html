<div class="hello"><div><p>Southampton Water and The Solent encompass a large area of protected water and is probably one of the busiest and most famous sailing areas in the world.</p>
<p>Not only is it home for thousands of leisure craft, it is a port for very large container and tanker vessels, cruise liners and ferries of all descriptions. Consequently it is advisable to be very alert when transiting these waters and to have up-to-date charts and sailing instructions.</p>
<p><span>The principal deep water navigational </span><span>channels within the statutory limits </span><span>of the Port of Southampton are well </span><span>marked by buoys and lights. These </span><span>channels are in constant use by </span><span>commercial vessels, including large </span><span>deep draught tankers (VLCCS), container </span><span>ships, ferries and other traffic.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Recreational users of the harbour are advised to </span><span>keep well clear of these main channels whenever </span><span>possible, and use the recommended crossing </span><span>areas. When main channels have to be crossed, </span><span>this should be done as nearly as practicable at </span><span>right angles. AVOID CROSSING THE BOWS OF ON </span><span>COMING COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC. </span><span>Large container ships and VLCCs, in particular, have </span><span>very restricted visibility for quite a distance ahead </span><span>when carrying a deck cargo of containers. You may </span><span>be able to see her clearly, but can she see you?</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Add to this, fast tides, a shallow bank, various defensive forts and a submerged barrier, and you have a very interesting mix! Another thing to add, is that it is never boring sailing here!</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>When planning to use a berth in a marina, it is wise to call ahead, and you will then be allocated a berth number and advised which side to you will be mooring. Most marinas in this area do not have dedicated pontoons for visitors, but slot them into available spaces.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Southampton_TownQuayapproach_ABP.bmp"/><span> </span>Apart from marinas, there are many mooring buoys and anchorages which can be used.</p>
<p>It is advisable to monitor VHF channel 12, the Port working frequency, which broadcasts traffic information for small craft (call sign VTS). Web: <strong><a href="http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/yguide.htm">Southampton VTS</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span>The relatively shallow water in this area can quickly build up to an unpleasent "Solent chop" in a fresh wind, but shelter is not usually difficult to find.</span></p>

<p><strong>Town Quay Marina</strong><br/><span>The marina entrance is a dogleg between two floating wave breaks that appear continuous from seaward (see photo). Call VHF Channel 80 on approach. The marina offers 24/7 berthing assistance. Beware of the adjacent Red Jet hi speed ferry. Craft &gt; 20m must get clearance from Southampton VTS to enter/depart the marina (VHF Channel 12).</span></p>
