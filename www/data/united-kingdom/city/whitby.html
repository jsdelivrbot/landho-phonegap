<div class="hello"><div><p>There are now extra pontoons in the Upper (inner) harbour. The harbour is dredged to a minimum depth of 1.5m which allows most yachts to enter at any state of the tide. A useful feature on this wild stretch of coast. Beware of the strong cross tide at the entrance.</p>
<p>Whitby Yacht Club has a pontoon in the Lower (outer) harbour, near the RNLI lifeboat station, which visiting yachts can use with prior arrangement. There is also usually plenty of room to berth alongside the harbour wall to sta'bd. The bridge into the inner harbour opens on request each half hour  during HW +/-2hrs.</p>
