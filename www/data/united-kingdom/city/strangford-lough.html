<div class="hello"><div><p>Famous for its birdlife, Strangford Lough is the U.K.’s largest sea inlet, being about 17 miles long and 4 miles wide. It provides an all weather, all tide shelter on a stretch of the west coast which has no other. It has numerous bays, inlets and islands, and is an important and protected wildlife site. At the northern end of the 5 mile long entrance narrows, lies the town of Strangford, and opposite, on the eastern shore, the village of Portaferry. It is a very popular sailing area and the many clubs in the area provide visting yachtsmen with a warm welcome.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>If unfamiliar with the area, use the eastern channel through the narrows and beware of the strong tides and the car ferry shuttling between Stangford and Portaferry.</p>
<p>In April 2008 the new tidal turbines within the narrows at the entrance to Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, were installed. Turbine blades are not a major navigational hazard fort yachts as they are set at a considerable depth. The only part of the structure that protrudes above the water is a large concrete post. The turbine is identified by the colours and top-mark of an "isolated danger mark".</p>
<p><b>Pilotage:</b></p>
<p>When there is wind against tide there are overfalls at the SE approach to the Lough and at the bar.</p>
<p>At the narrows of the lough, by the turbine, the flood starts at HW - 3 1/2 hours Belfast  and the ebb starts at HW +  2 1/2 . At Springs the tidal stream can reach 7 knots.</p>
<p><b>Moorings:</b></p>
<p>There are a few visitors' moorings at Strangford. The Quoile yacht club has a visitors pontoon as well as moorings, as do several of the yacht and sailing clubs around the lough.</p>
<p>There are plenty of anchorages and it will be possible to find shelter whatever the weather. Castleward Bay, Grey Point and between Jackdaw and Chapel Islands are some useful ones.</p>
