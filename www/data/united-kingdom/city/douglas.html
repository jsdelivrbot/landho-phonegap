<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Inner Harbour is approached via a lifing bridge and flap gate which maintains a minimum depth of 2 metres. The marina is situated here, in the centre of the town, and offers complete shelter. It is advisable to call in advance to check for space.</span></p>
<p>In the summer season, there is a pontoon on Battery Pier in southern corner of the Outer Harbour, which is useful, but a bit of a long walk into the town. In strong north easterly or easterly winds this pontoon becomes untenable. The Outer Harbour itself is less comfortable due to the frequent ferry and other ship movements.</p>
