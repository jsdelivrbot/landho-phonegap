<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Kirkwall can be approached from the north-west through Eynhallow Sound, from the north through Vasa Sound, and from the east through Shapinsay Sound and the String. Perches and buoys mark the skerries (shallow areas) but there are off track hazards, particularly in the northern approaches. Final approach is with St Magnus Cathedral bearing 190degT which at night is the white sector of Kirkwall's Pierhead light. Entrance to the marina is immediately to the east of a large grey ice plant on the pierhead.</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, yachts now have their own space in a marina behind the eastern breakwater.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage, in about 3m, NW of the pierhead.</p>
<p>An alternative to Kirkwall, is the marina at Stromness, 16nm to the west.</p></div></div>
