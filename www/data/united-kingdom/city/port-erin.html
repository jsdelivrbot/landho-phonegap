<div class="hello"><div><p>This inlet is a secure anchorage except in strong W to NW winds. Raglan Pier in the S of the bay provides a sheltered drying harbour in that corner. The bottom is hard sand and there is about 3.5m alongside at HW. Beware of the ruined breakwater extending due north from the southern side, and also take take when anchoring to avoid the submarine cables running east/west through the bay. The best anchorgae is north of Raglan Pier in 3 to 5m or pick up one of the two visitors buoys.</p>
