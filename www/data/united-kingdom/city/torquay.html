<div class="hello"><div><p>In settled weather, there are several anchorages around the Bay, but none providing all-round shelter close to Torquay.</p>
<p>The harbour has a marina and a town dock, both of which provide visitors' berths. There is also a floating pontoon alongside Haldon Pier, which protects the southern side of the harbour.</p>
<p>The inner harbour (access over a sill), is usually full of local boats.</p>
<p>A nice alternative to the town is to take a mooring in Babbacombe Bay.</p></div></div>
