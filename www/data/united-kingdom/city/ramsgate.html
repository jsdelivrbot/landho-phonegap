<div class="hello"><div><p>When cruising the east coast or the southern North sea, Ramsgate provides a very useful stopover. That said, short-term berthing here is not particularly comfortable and you probably will find you won't want to stay more than a night or two.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approaches</strong><br/> Before entering (or leaving) the harbour, call "Ramsgate Port Control" on VHF channel 14. Once inside the harbour call the marina on VHF channel 80 for berthing instructions. <span>During the summer period the marina staff will allocate a suitable berth for you. During the winter period you will be instructed to take any vacant berth, unless they are marked ‘Reserved’.</span></p>
<p><strong>Berthing</strong><br/><span>There are three sections to the harbour: the Outer Harbour, the Inner Harbour, and the Yacht Harbour. </span></p>
<p><span>The Outer Harbour is the former ferry terminal, but is not used very often for anything except maneuvering in and out of the Marina. </span></p>
<p><span>The Marina takes up the Inner Harbour and the Yacht Harbour. The Marina is split up into two sections: the Inner Harbour (which is split into East and West sections) and the Yacht Harbour. </span></p>
<p><span>The Inner Harbour (the East and West sections) is accessible at all tides, however it is quite rolly and skippers should be careful to tie up properly to avoid damage against the docks. The Inner Marina docks are constructed of small segments and cause an uncomfortable jerking motion on longer (&gt;12m) yachts if there is any swell, wake, or tide shift coming in the entrance. </span></p>
<p><span>The West Marina (left after entering Inner Harbour) is where the visiting yachts are usually directed, but any yacht longer than 12m will be on a hammerhead or the breakwater; the East Marina is very full of pilot boats, fishing boats, and work boats for the nearby Kent wind generator farm that is under construction. These working boats are in motion at all hours and often throw a wake into the West Marina. </span></p>
<p><span>The extremely well-protected Inner Yacht Marina is accessed by a lock, however is only available for permanent berth holders.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/> No animals are allowed anywhere in Ramsgate Harbour, including the marinas.</p>
