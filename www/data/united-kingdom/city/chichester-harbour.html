<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large, but generally shallow, harbour just to the east of Portsmouth and The Solent. It is home to a large number of sailing boats as well as their associated industries and services. </p>
<p>The harbour and its surrounding wetlands is also a refuge for a wide variety of wildlife and rare waterfowl.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is relatively narrow for such an extensive area of water, but it does have a bar and care should be taken to cross this at the right time. In strong winds over tide it can be extremely dangerous. The ebb tide can reach up to 6 knots through the entrance. It is not easy to identify the channel at night.<br/> NB A December 2009 survey shows a least depth over Chichester Bar of 1-2m below CD. The HM advises that after severe gales at least depth of 0.8m below CD should be assumed.</p>
<p>There are several marinas and yacht clubs which welcome visitors.</p>
<p>Anchoring is only permitted in designated areas. These being East Head, Pilsey Island and the western end of Itchenor Reach.</p>
<p>Chichester Channel runs up to Itchenor Reach and Bosham Channel. From East Head SHM buoy pass between Snowhill SHM buy and Sandhead PHM buoy then head about 030deg for 1m to leave Chaldock NCM Bn to starboard. The transit shown on AC 3418 need not be identified nor followed exactly. 6 ca E of Chaldock Bn the channel divides. Turn N into Bosham Channel or continue ESE into Itchenor Reach for Birdham Pool and Chichester Marina beyond which is the drying Fishbourne Channel to Dell Quay.</p>
<p>Anchoring is prohibited in Itchenor Reach and Bosham Channel.  <strong>Note</strong>: Following the bed levelling work, the least depth on Sandhead bank is now 1.9 below CD. Buoys in the area have been moved accordingly.</p>
