<div class="hello"><div><p>This famous sailing centre is situated on the west bank of the river Medina, facing across the Solent to Southampton Water.</p>
<p><span>Construction of the new breakwater here is now complete and well-marked, even at night. There are two approaches around the new breakwater: the main channel to the west and a very small, quite narrow, and relatively shallow approach to the east although there are plans to dredge this channel. Both are buoyed. For deep draught yachts, the east approach is usable near high-tide or to avoid the high-speed ferry traffic in the main (west) channel. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of the high-speed ferries using the western entrance.</p>
<p>There are plenty of visitor's mooring balls here and marinas with visitor's berths.</p>
<p>During Cowes Week, in the middle of August, finding a berth can be very difficult (and expensive!) and rafting up will be the norm. If a quieter spot is wanted, Island Harbour Marina or the moorings off the Folly Inn are more likely to offer a berth away from the racing fraternity. The berthing masters, out and about in their launches marked "Harbour Master", are usually very helpful.</p>
<p>There are marinas in West and East Cowes, and also up the Medina River. In strong North to East winds, the marinas in West Cowes are subject to rough water at times. Shepherds Wharf Marina is more protected in these winds compared to Cowes Yacht Haven. Marinas further up the Medina would be a better choice in strong winds from the North through East.</p>
<p>Beware of the strong cross tides when entering the river, and the chain ferry, just up stream of the Red Funnel Ferry Terminal.</p>
<p>Once past Cowes, the river is very rural, and if the tide serves, a trip up to the capital of the island, Newport, is well worth the effort. Be aware, though, that Newport harbour dries.</p>
<p>Alternatively water taxis run from Cowes to the Folly Inn, a popular sailor's pub.</p>
<p><span>Camper &amp; Nicholsons Marinas will be developing the new 400-berth Victoria Marina development at East Cowes during 2016/17. </span></p>
