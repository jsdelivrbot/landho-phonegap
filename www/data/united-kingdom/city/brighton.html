<div class="hello"><div><p>Brighton is, principally, a colourful "seaside town", and has been so for over 200 years. Apart from The Royal Pavilion, it has no stunning or ancient architecture, just a certain Victorian charm and an atmosphere all of its own.</p>
<p>The town is situated in a dip in the chalk cliffs of the Sussex coast, but there is no natural inlet or port. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong><img class="image-left" src="Countries/BrightonMarinaVillage_SYSuwena.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Brighton</strong><br/> The only shelter is in the marina, which is uncompromisingly built of huge concrete blocks, projecting into the sea. Brighton Marina is the largest in the UK.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the marina has undergone a substantial refurbishment. There are now new facilities, boat repair shed and a "marina village" housing bars, restaurants, shops, cinemas and other entertainment venues<i> (see photo taken by SY Suwena)</i>.</p>
<p>The entrance is straightforward, but in heavy weather yachts are advised to approach the entrance from due south, to avoid the backwash from the breakwaters.</p>
<p>After entering the harbour normal sized visitors berths are immediately on the port side near the entrance. This marina does suffer from bird guano on the pontoons, however cruisers report that the visitors pontoons are kept relatively clean.</p>
<p>There is a local hypermarket close to the docks.</p>
<p><strong>Newhaven</strong><br/>Seven miles from Brighton, Newhaven lies at the mouth of the River Ouse. Busy commercial port with regular ferry services to Dieppe so care needed. Marina lies approximately quarter of a mile from the harbour entrance on the west bank.</p>
<p>Position: 50° 46'.20N., 00° 03'.70E.</p>
