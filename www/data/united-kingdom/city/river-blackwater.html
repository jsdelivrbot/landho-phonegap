<p><span></span><span>The river is great for kayaks and canoes, dinghies &amp; sailing boats, plus it has one of the only natural Salt Water swimming pools in the UK!</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The approach to <strong>Tollesbury Marina</strong> at the end of Woodrolfe Creek, west of Mersea Island, is now marked with lit buoys (see photo below). </span><span>Tollesbury is a pretty and relaxed waterside village ideal for families and walkers (there are great walks nearby on the sea wall, past the wildlife sanctuary and out along the river Blackwater or shorter walks around Tollesbury). </span><span>Tollesbury Marina has excellent facilities on site and it's just a short walk into the village.</span></p>
<p>Further up the Blackwater, on the southern bank, is <strong>Bradwell Marina</strong> followed by the <strong>Blackwater Marina</strong> a further 6nm up the river on Maylandsea Creek.</p>
<p>Careful note of the tides needs to be taken if proceeding even further up-river to the lock at <strong>Heybridge Basin</strong> or to <strong>Maldon</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of anchorages in the river if a boat can take the ground.</p>
