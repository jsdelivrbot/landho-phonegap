<div class="hello"><div><p>This attractive Cornish town (its name is pronounced foy), is a great favourite with most West Country sailors. With its easy entrance and deep harbour, an increasing number of cruise liners are being attracted here, gradually replacing the commercial activities of this ancient china clay port. </p>
<p>The sight of the huge china clay vessels being skilfully twirled round in the middle of the harbour and then being drudged stern first up river to the loading quay, is very impressive. Especially when they seem only inches from your bow as you sit peacefully on your mooring!</p>
<p>Position 50°19.5'N, 04°38.5'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is accessible during all tides and in all weathers. It is normally very sheltered, although in strong southerly gales, there is quite a bit of swell in the lower end of the harbour.</p>
<p>There is no marina here, but plenty of mooring buoys and several visitors' pontoons. Even in regatta week, the Harbour Master usually finds room for you somewhere. During the season, the Harbour launch or the HM's dory (Zebedee and Dougal - this is, after all <code>Troy Town</code>!) are usually out and about helping with berthing.</p>
<p>There are 2 short stay pontoons just off the town, at Albert Quay and Berrill's Yard. Here it is possible to berth free of charge for 2 hours, to get water, shop or change crews etc. but beware of abusing the facility or you might be charged a steep fee. The dinghy landing is also here.</p>
<p>Anchoring is only with the HM's permission and is charged the same as for mooring buoys.</p>
