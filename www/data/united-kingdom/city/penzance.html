<div class="hello"><div><p>Penzance inner harbour, the Wet Dock, provides secure, sheltered berths. It is accessible from 2 hours before, to 1 hour after HW. The waiting buoys outside the harbour have now been removed. In settled weather is possible to anchor east of the harbour in about 2 metres LAT.</p>
<p>The approaches to the harbour are shallow, and in strong on-shore winds it is unsafe to attempt entry. Boats should divert to Newlyn, which now has a yacht pontoon and offers a safe, all weather port.</p>
<p>There have been plans for several years to have a proper yacht marina built at Penzance, but as yet nothing has been done.</p>
