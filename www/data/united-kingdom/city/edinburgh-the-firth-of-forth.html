<div class="hello"><div><p>Any berthing options near Edinburgh are in rather industrial surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Granton harbour</strong> (on the Edinburgh waterfront) partly dries but recent dredging now allows 24hr access with a depth of 2m at LW at the entrance and at the pontoons.</p>

<p>Granton Harbour © Google Earth</p>
<p><strong>Port Edgar</strong> is a full service marina lying just west of the Forth Road Bridge at South Queensferry. T<span>ake extra care when arriving in the dark as the</span><span> wave barrier in the middle of the marina entrance is poorly lit. Enter from the west and keep well clear of both sides. Due to the proximity of both road and bridge, this is not a quiet berth. In NW'ly winds the swell affects berths on the hammerheads.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anstruther harbour</strong> lies on the north bank of the Firth of Forth, close to the entrance. It dries but is accessible 4hrs each side of HW.</span></p>
<p>Another harbour in the Forth suitable for yachts,is at Grangemouth. The rest are purely commercial.</p>
