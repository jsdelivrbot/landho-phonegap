      Aberdeen and Stonehaven Yacht Club (ASYC) is unusual as it offers sailing opportunities at different venues during the year. From March to the end of May the club operates on the freshwater Loch of Skene, 10 miles west of Aberdeen. This large and picturesque loch is an ideal location for relative newcomers to dinghy sailing, as well as providing a great location for competitive racing. At the beginning of June the club's activities move to the more challenging North Sea coastal waters  at Stonehaven, 15 miles south of Aberdeen, where sailing takes place until mid-November.
