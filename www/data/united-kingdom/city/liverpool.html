<div class="hello"><div><p>Sitting on both banks of the River Mersey, Liverpool was, for much of its 800 years of history, the gateway to Ireland in addition to being the last sight of England for hundred of thousands of emigrants to America. Although heavily bombed during the 2nd world war, Liverpool today is a vibrant, modern city. It is, of course, also a very busy commercial port.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Leeds and Liverpool canal is at Stanley dock. This canal, 160 miles long, joins Liverpool to the east coast. Max. draft 1m.</p>
<p>The 31 mile long Manchester Ship canal has no such restrictions. Its entrance is at Eastham dock.</p>
<p>Location 53° 28'02"N,03° 01'08"W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is good shelter in the marina, based in the old Brunswick and Colburg docks. The entrance is 1NM S of the distictive Liver building. Access is about 2hrs +/- HW (less at neaps) from 0600 to 2200 in the summer.</p>
<p>Berths can also be found in the Albert and Canning docks. Access here is more restricted, and is generally HW-2 to HW, but not on every tide. It is also <strong>VERY</strong> expensive to use the lock.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong> In settled weather, there is an anchorage on the SW side of the river.</p>
<p><strong>Approaches</strong> Take care to keep to the buoyed fairways as the whole area of the approaches has many sandbanks and the channels shift. In strong wind over tide conditions, steep breaking seas can occur in the outer reaches where the tidal stream can be up to 5kn.</p>
