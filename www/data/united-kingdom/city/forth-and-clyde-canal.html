<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The 56 mile long canal joins the Firth of Clyde with the Firth of Forth (Glasgow to Edinburgh). It was restored and re-opened in 2001. The final link joining the Forth &amp; Clyde canal and the Union canal is the massive new boat lift, known as The Falkirk Wheel. This impressive piece of modern engineering can lift 8 boats at once and provides access into the heart of Edinburgh.</span></p></div></div>
