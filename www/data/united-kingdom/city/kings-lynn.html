<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying just 2 miles up the Great Ouse river on the southern side of The Wash on England's east coast, King's Lynn is not the easiest port to approach. The sand banks, as in most of the Wash, are traitorous and should be navigated with great care and the latest charts.</p>
<p>Call the harbourmaster before approaching for the lastest information.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Shelter is very good and entry possible HW +/-3hrs.</p>
<p>There are plans for a marina at Sutton Bridge on the River Nene, prior to that, three floating pontoons have been installed for temporary and overnight berthing on the Great Ouse during the summer months.</p>
<p>This is a busy fishing port but moorings may be available in the river from the local yacht clubs.</p>
