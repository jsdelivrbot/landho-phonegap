<div class="hello"><div><p>This huge natural harbour, known as Plymouth Sound, owes a significant part of its present day protection to the mile long breakwater, completed in 1841 after taking 29 years to build. </p>
<p>The Sound is easy to enter round either end of it, but the western entrance, marked with a lighthouse, is the main entrance for commercial vessels and is easier for strangers to identify at night. Just be aware that at high spring tides, the whole breakwater can be awash and hardly visible.</p>
<p>Position 50°20'N, 04°10'W.</p>
