      In-bound up the Thames, vessels must call the Thames Barrier, call sign, 'Woolwich Radio' on VHF channel 14, when passing Crayford Ness, giving their ETA at the Barrage. At Margaret Ness they should obtain confirmation of clearence to proceed. Green lighted arrows indicate which gates are open. Out-bound vessels follow the same proceedure at Tower Bridge and Blackwall Point.<br>
The barrage is completely closed once a month for about 3 hours and for a whole tide once a year in September/October at high spring tides.<br>
Please telephone the day before to check (020 8305 4188) times of any closure.<br><br>

The piers are numbered 1 to 9 and the spans lettered A to K. Spans A, H, J &amp; K are NOT navigable.  C to F are for larger ships and B (out-bound) and G (in-bound) are for yachts and smaller vessels. <br>
The transit must be made under power, with the sails lowered.

<div class="hello"><div><p>For those who wish to take their boat right into the heart of London, there are now several marinas to choose from, several within a relatively short distance of the centre. St Katharine's Dock, right by the Tower of London, is the best known. Only half a mile downstream, there are two marinas, South Dock Marina, on the south shore of the Thames, and Limehouse Basin Marina, on the north shore. The latter is also the home of the Cruising Association, in whose premises visiting sailors are most welcome. Its excellent reference library should make it the natural choice for any cruising sailor.</p>
<p>Further down stream, the new marina at Gravesend is a useful base when approaching or leaving the centre of the Capital, being 23NM from Tower Bridge. Several of the old commercial docks now house yacht marinas too.</p>
<p>It is important to to keep clear of the freight terminal at Canvey, Shellhaven and Coryton and the London Gateway Port Reclamation Area at Thames Haven. This includes the jetties at Thames Haven. (updated May 2009).</p>
<p><b>Anchoring</b><br>
Between Gravesend and Tower Bridge there are no recommended anchorages in the river. The strong tides, the commercial traffic and the number of broken piles and other ancient debris along the banks, all form reasons to avoid doing so.</br></p>
