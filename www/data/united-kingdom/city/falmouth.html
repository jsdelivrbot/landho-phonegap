<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour can be entered in all weathers, day or night.</p>
<p>Falmouth Harbour offers a wide range of mooring options from pontoon berths in the middle of the town to quiet anchorages, and all types in between.</p>
<p>There are visitors' mooring buoys are available in the yacht anchorage off the Town Quay, at Mylor, at Malpas, and off St Mawes, in the Percuil River (apply to St Mawes Sailing Club for these). There are 4 marinas, and, additionally, several island pontoons (April-October only) where visitors can berth. There is one in the anchorage off the town and another couple further up the Fal, where the river narrows, beyond Restronguet Creek.</p>
<p>Anchoring is unrestricted, except close to the commercial docks.</p>
<p>A planned new marina known as Port Falmouth Marina, east of the Port Pendennis Marina, close to the commercial docks does not appear to have been developed yet.</p>
<p>In the Helford River, there are 25 green visitors' buoys (marked <code>visitors</code>). Rafting is necessary in the high season. No anchoring is permitted east of Durgan Bay or within 250m of the shore of the Bay or in Porth Navas Creek.</p>
<p>See <a><strong>Harbour Authority/leisure</strong></a> website for more information.</p>
