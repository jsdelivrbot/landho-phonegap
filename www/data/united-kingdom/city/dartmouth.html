<div class="hello"><div><p>Dartmouth is a most attractive cruising destination. Not only does it have a stunningly scenic entrance and an old town full of interest; it is possible to sail the 8 miles up the picturesque River Dart to the ancient town of Totness, passing many peaceful anchorages on the way.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is narrow and deep, and is possible in most conditions, although it can be lively in strong on-shore winds.</p>
<p>In Dartmouth itself, there are 3 marinas, several Harbour Authority pontoons (marked with blue flags) and visitors' buoys all along the river. There is also an anchorage opposite the town, just north of Darthaven Marina. <span> There is a dinghy pontoon directly adjacent to the Town Quay and Boat Float.</span></p>
<p>Further up the river, at Dittisham, there are also visitors' buoys.</p>
<p>The most convenient of the DHA's visitors' moorings, is <span>both sides of the Town Quay pontoon near the ferry</span>. Take care with the strong tidal stream which flows through here, as the up stream end is barred by a pedestrian bridge and there is no room for error!</p>
<p><span>Note there is no berthing on the DHA ferry landing, even at night. The ferry runs very late and begins very early in the morning. It runs back and forth every few minutes and is the only way across the Dart River.</span></p>
<p><span>All visitor's mooring are clearly marked. During July and August, the fees are doubled after the first 14 days. </span>Daily Harbour Dues are levied on all boats using the river and these are normally collected along with any mooring fees.</p>
