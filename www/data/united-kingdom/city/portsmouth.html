<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to this large and sheltered harbour, is narrow and very busy with all types of craft, including naval ships and ferries.</p>
<p>All vessels over 20m must obtain permission from QHM via VHF channel 11 to enter, leave or move within the harbour.</p>
<p>Vessels under 20m MUST use the Small Boat Channel (SBC). It is just outside the western edge of the main channel. If fitted, the engine must be used.</p>
<p>The SBC may be used (at the shipper's discretion) even when the main channel is closed (e.g. in fog).</p>
<p>Monitor VHF channel 11 while entereing, leaving or manouvering within the harbour. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to this large and sheltered harbour, is narrow and very busy with all types of craft, including navy boats and ferries. Yachts must have their engines on while transiting this entrance and strictly keep to the small boat channel.

<p>There is a choice of several marinas within the harbour and a large number of swinging, as well as drying moorings. The upper reaches of the harbour are shallow. Gosport and Haslar marinas are a short, inexpensive ferry ride from the town centre, however Gosport has all shops and services.</p>
<p>Beware of the ferries crossing east/west just inside the entrance.</p>
<p>Boats should monitor VHF channel 11 when entering and using this harbour.</p>
