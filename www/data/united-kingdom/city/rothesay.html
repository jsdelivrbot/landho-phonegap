<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a useful port in the Firth of Clyde and is easy to enter at all states of the tide and provides a good base for exploring this part of Scotland. The old paddle steamers Waverley and Balmoral are often based here during the summer and the harbour is a busy ferry port. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is good shelter here in both the inner and outer harbours, as well as on the pontoons south of West Arm. Beware of the strong current sweeping towards the rocks on the eastern side of the harbour.</p>
<p>All the berths in the marina are for visitors. Most facilities available, but no haul or lift-out options. </p>
<p>There are 35 good mooring buoys just outside the harbour entrance. The are pink and marked <code>BBC</code> (Bute Berthing Co.).</p>
<p>The shower and toilet facilities are in an immaculate, if cramped, victorian building by the harbour. They close at 2030.</p>
