<div class="hello"><div><p>Bristol, with its long seafaring history, is a fascinating city for cruising sailors to visit. In the last twenty years the docks have been transformed and the area around, revitalised. Yachts can sail up the River Avon, through the Gorge and right into the heart of the city.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The marina at Portishead makes timing your arrival at the entrance to the Avon, a relatively simple matter. The tides in the Bristol Channel must be taken seriously, though. With a tidal range of up to 14 metres, the correct timing of harbour approaches is crucial. The cross-tide at Avonmouth can be 5 knots.</span></p>
<p>Yachts bound for Bristol, MUST call <code>Avonmouth Radio</code> on VHF channel 12 when they reach the English &amp; Welsh Grounds Safe Water Mark, and again, on entering the river. If no radio is fitted, then flag <code>R</code> must be flown (or flash morse R if at night) and the Signal Station will reply by light or loud hailer. At Black Rock (just under a mile before the first lock) call <code>City Docks Radio</code> on VHF channel 14 for locking instructions.</p>
<p>It is 6 miles up the Avon to the city docks, and yachts must aim to be at the river entrance 2 hours before HW Avonmouth. After passing under Brunel's suspension bridge, the Cumberland Basin lock is not far, just round the next bend. Once through into the Floating Harbour, there is a wide number of options for berthing.</p>
<p>Any kind of approach to Bristol needs good timing and planning. The tides in the Severn Estuary are fierce with ranges of up to 13 m odd... these will have to be negotiated before you get anywhere near the River Avon. Streams can reach up to 5 knts at springs and 3 Knts at neaps.</p>
<p>The lock in to the Floating Harbour only opens from a couple of hours before HW to about 15 minutes before HW. The visiting yachtsman or motorboater therefore needs to arrive at the lock entrance within this window of time. If you miss the lock in by arriving too late you will have no alternative other than to exit the River Avon completely, as there is nowhere to stop safely while awaiting the next tide.</p>
<p><strong>Cumberland Basin Lock</strong><br/> Dock Master<br/> Tel:+44 (0)117 927 3633 <br/> VHF Channel 14 "City Docks Radio" (use low power) <br/> The lock opens at HW -2½, HW -1½ and HW -¼ If the last lock-in is missed, call VHF channel 12 for advice. The river dries, but the mud at the waiting pontoons is soft. The lock master is on duty from 3 hours before HW until about 45 minutes after. The bridges are not opened if the level in the river is above the level in the Floating Harbour. Nor are they opened between 08:00-09:00 and 17:00-18:00 (Mon-Fri).</p>
