<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour, tucked into the SW corner of Tor Bay, can be entered in any weather, but in strong northerlies it can be "interesting. The outer harbour is open to the north but provides good shelter from the prevailing SW'lies.</p>
<p>There are just 2 visitors' buoys in the outer harbour for boats up to 30ft, but space can usually be found in the marina (or on their <code>Events</code> pontoon). The <code>Town pontoon</code> is also available to visitors, but the local heritage fleet is often moored here and it is exposed to the north westerlies. It has no toilets or showers.</p>
<p>The Yacht Club has two small pontoons in front of the clubhouse (just north of the fish quay), but they are not connected to the shore.</p>
<p>The two coves just to the west of the entrance provide good anchorages, although they are open to the east, and can get very crowded on summer weekends. It is also possible to anchor in the outer harbour, clear of the moorings. The holding is reasonable but the area is exposed to swell.</p>
