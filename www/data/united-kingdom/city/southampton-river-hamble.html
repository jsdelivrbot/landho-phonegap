<div class="hello"><div><p>Southampton has five marinas, several boatyards and four yacht clubs lining its banks, and is packed with pile and trot moorings. <span>With boat tenders buzzing back and forth, sailing dinghies tacking their way up river, and any number of the 3,000 yachts which call the Hamble their home, on the move, this is a very busy place.</span></p>
<p>Sailing is allowed in the river, but is not a recommended option for the stranger, and wash should be kept to a minimum. There are no anchorages at all here. <span>Great care is required when mooring as the ebb can run through the berths at up to 3 knots and the pontoons are tightly packed. As in all the Solent area, there is a double high water, which results in nine hours of flood tide and three of ebb.</span></p>
<p>All the marinas and boatyards have a chandlery, and if they do not have a bar/restaurant on site, there will be one not far away.</p>
