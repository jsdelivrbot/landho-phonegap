<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on the easternmost part of the East Anglian coast, Great Yarmouth is a busy commercial port. However, through the river Yare, it provides access to a facinating maze of inland waterways, called The Norfolk Broads. Most of this area can be accessed by masted boats as nearly all the bridges are swing or lifting ones.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Inbound vessels should contact Port Operations on VHF Channel 12 prior to approaching the entrance to request clearance to enter.</p>
<p>There is no anchoring in the river, nor berthing for small craft in the outer harbour. When approaching the port, listen out on VHF channel 12 for information on large ship movements. Beware of strong tidal flow in the river as it can run at 4 to 5 knots.</p>
<p><b>Berthing</b><br>
Moorings are available on Hall Quay, just south of Haven Bridge on the East side of the river (opposite the red brick Town Hall building). Mooring tails are in place to aid mooring from the vessel. Vessels should moor adjacent to the access ladders. Minimum depth is 3m at MLWS. Make adequate allowance for the tide when arriving on the flood and ensure that you are not set up river towards the Haven Bridge.</br></p>
<p>These berths are close to the Town Centre. A five minute walk along Regent Road will take you to the Market Place.</p>
<p>The Broads can be accessed via the Haven and Breydon Bridges. Call <code>Yarmouth Radio</code> on VHF channel 12 before passing through the Haven Bridge. </p>

      Bridge bookings can be made by telephone during office hours. Lifts for weekends should be booked by 1600 hours on Friday or on the previous working day in the case of Public Holidays. Lifts are not normally made during the peak traffic periods - 08:00 to 09:15 and 12:00 to 13:00. The last lift of the day is normally 16:00. <br><br>

Vessels will be grouped together on lifts whenever possible. When craft are to transit the bridge in opposite directions, those vessels going “with the tide” will be given priority. <br><br>
The bridge is only manned ten minutes before a lift and vessels waiting for a lift should seek advice from the Bridge Master if unsure of what to do.
