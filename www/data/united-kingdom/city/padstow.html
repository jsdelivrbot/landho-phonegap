<div class="hello"><div><p>The small inner harbour is protected by lock gates, and can, at times, get rather crowded. The Harbour Master will probably be out and about to help you berth, which, for yachts, is usually to sta'bd once through the lock.</p>
<p>The lock is open 2 hours each side of HW, and there is a least depth of 3m inside. In heavy weather or if there is a swell, do not try and make the entrance early as the sand bar there can create a dangerous ground swell.</p>
<p>Harbour Commissioners have approximately 180 seasonal and holiday moorings at Rock. Contact the Harbour Master for details.</p>
<p>Showers, toilets and laundry facilities are all in the red-brick building on the north side of the harbour, and also at the harbour office on the south side of the entrance. Access is by key code.</p>
<p>A usefull website of <a href="http://http//:www.padstow-harbour.co.uk"><b>Padstow</b></a> showing both a chart and video of the entrance.</p></div></div>
