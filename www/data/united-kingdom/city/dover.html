<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Dover_BeachandMarina_SYSuwena.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Situated on the south eastern corner of England, Dover is the closest port to the French coast. T<span>he Dover area is extremely busy at all hours of the day or night. Ferries and ships enter and exit the harbour at high speeds. It is advisable to contact Dover Port Control on CH74 and notify them of your course and intentions, even if only passing by. Notifying them keeps you on their radar until your well out of range of the high-speed craft, ferries, or shipping.</span></p>
<p>In spite of being a busy commercial port, yachts are very welcome here and there are good facilities in protected berths.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Permission must be obtained BEFORE entering (or leaving), by calling Port Control on VHF channel 74, or attracting the attention of a harbour control launch (5 short flashes). </span></p>
<p><span>With over 160 ferry movements per day, great care is needed when negotiating either of the two entrances. Also, beware of the strong cross-tides in the approaches.</span></p>
<p>From 3 hours before until 1 hour after HW Dover, the tide runs into the western entrance and at all other times it runs out of the entrance at up to 2.3 knots. From 2 hours before to 4 hours after HW Dover, the tide outside the harbour flows in a northeasterly direction and at all other times it runs south-west.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/DoverMarina_Granvilledock_SYSuwena.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/><strong>Marina approaches </strong><br/>Dover has an Outer Harbour containing the ferry and deepwater commercial berths and an Inner Harbour, between the Prince of Wales and Admiralty piers where the Marina is located. An approach channel between the North and South piers has an average dredged depth of 5 metres gradully reducing as it enters the Tidal Harbour.</p>
<p>Yachts are often met at the entrance by a harbour control launch and advised on suitable berthing.</p>
<p>Most visitors use the marina in Granville Dock <i>(see photo taken by SY Suwena)</i>, but pontoon berths are also available in the Wellington Dock and the Tidal Basin, and visitors' buoys in the outer harbour. There is an anchorage in the outer harbour, but it is generally uncomfortable due to the constant movement of ferries.</p>
<p>Anchored boats cannot be left unattended here.</p>
