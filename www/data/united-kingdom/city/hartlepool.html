<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The marina, the entrance of which lies just S of the commercial harbour,  provides excellent shelter, but in strong E/NE winds the relatively shallow waters of the bay can be a bit nasty. If the marina entrance is not possible due to either heavy seas or depth of tide, yachts may enter the Victoria Harbour, but call first.</span></p>
<p>The large town of Hartlepool provides all services and is especially good for provisioning. This is particularly useful if planning a trip to the Farne Islands. The town centre is about a 15 minute walk from the marina.</p></div></div>
