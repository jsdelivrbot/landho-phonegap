<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The shelter is good, with just occasionally a swell in strong N/NE winds. There are a good number of blue visitors' mooring buoys and, in addition, there is now a pontoon with about 12 finger berths.</span></p>
<p>Anchoring in the harbour can be a problem. The holding is not good in the very soft mud and the debris of fish farming and other old moorings can be a hazard.</p>
<p>The harbour can get very crowded during July and August. An alternative is the anchorage in Lock na Druimh Buidhe, but, as in many Scottish Lochs (including Tobermory Harbour), a fair amount of anchor warp is needed as the shallow area near the shore is narrow and the depth very quickly drops to 20 or 30m.</p></div></div>
