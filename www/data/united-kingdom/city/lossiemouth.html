<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Lossiemouth (or Lossie as it is known locally) is a former fishing port on the southern shore of the Moray Firth, just 5 miles north of Elgin. As with many of the coastal towns in the area, it consists mainly of small, neat, white stone cottages built during the 18th and 19th century; an era of prosperity due to the herring fishing.</span></p>
