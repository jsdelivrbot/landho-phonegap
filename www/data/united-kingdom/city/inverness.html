<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is adjacent to the old Longman Quay (now being redeveloped). Inverness Harbour is immediately to port after passing under the road bridge at the head of The Moray Firth.</p>
<p>There are two more marinas inside the Canal, the entrance to which can be difficult in strong winds.</p>
<p>Yachts over 11 metres cannot enter the yacht haven, but must berth alongside the main quay. Prior permission must be received from the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>Boats transiting the canal, need to proceed along the north side of the Firth until the sealock can be seen to port. There is good holding in 8m NW of the lock while awaiting entry.</p>
