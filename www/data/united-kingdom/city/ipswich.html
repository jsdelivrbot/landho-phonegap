<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Ipswich, tucked up the River Orwell, away from the bustle of Harwich, is an interesting and historic port of call. It is still a working port and an eye must be kept out for the quite large ships which still use the quay opposite the yachthaven.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/IpswichHarbourMarina_SYSuwena.jpg"/>The Ipswitch Haven marina <i>(see photo taken by SY Suwena)</i> is accessed via a lock (see details re. locking through below). If the HW tide prediction is for more than 4.5m, these gates will be closed and it will not be possible to go in or out.  During big spring tides it is, therefore, advisable to contact Ipswich LockControl (VHF 68) if you plan to enter or leave near the top of the tide.</p>
<p><span>There is a waiting pontoon on the west side of the entrance if needed. When in the marina and intending to leave, most locals will request lock-out before leaving the dock: occasionally it takes a few minutes to cycle the locks. There is also a waiting pontoon to the west of the lock, but local work boats are tied up nearby and it might be hard to see.</span></p>
<p>There are a total of five marinas to choose from in the area, as well as several anchorages and buoys on the way up the river. But, beware, most of them dry and East Coast mud is notoriously sticky! The river is also home to the well-known "Butt and Oyster" pub at Pin Mill, as well as several traditional sailing barges.</p>
<p>All marinas except the Neptune Marina have 24 hr access.</p>
<p><strong>Prince Philip Lock</strong> <br/> VHF 68<br/> Call the lock before passing under the Orwell Bridge<span> to request permission to lock through</span>.<br/><span><i>This lock can be found in two very different states: <br/>(1) with the lock pontoon in, or <br/>(2) with the lock pontoon out. <br/>Because large warships, container ships, and tall ships occasionally use this lock, there is a removable floating pontoon inside the lock. The pontoon is necessary for smaller craft or moderately-sized yachts to tie up inside the lock safely.</i></span></p>
