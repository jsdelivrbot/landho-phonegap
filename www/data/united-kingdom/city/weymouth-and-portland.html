<div class="hello"><div><p>A typical south coast seaside resort, Weymouth also has a lively port area whose ancient buildings have, in recent years, been restored and put to new uses. The wide sandy beach stretching NE from the port is particularly attractive to families.</p>
<p>The adjacent man-made harbour of Portland was the venue for the sailing events for the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The entrance to Weymouth harbour is easily identified by the 55m high Sealife Tower which lies 200m west of the entrance.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Berthing - Weymouth</strong> Rafting up is usual on the visitors' pontoons in the outer harbour as many cruisers stop here to await a favourable tide round Portland Bill, or head for its shelter after the long haul across Lyme Bay.</p>
<p>Visitors are requested to call VHF 12 '<code>Weymouth Harbour'</code> before approaching the entrance and they will then be allocated a berth.</p>
<p>Boats up to 10m berth on the south side of the harbour (the Cove) and those over 10m berth on the north side, opposite the Lifeboat station. Motor boats moor by the Harbour office. If over 18m, advance warning is advisable.</p>
<p>Water and electricity is available on the pontoons on both sides of the harbour. Toilets and showers are at the Harbour office.</p>
<p>Access to Weymouth marina is via a lifting bridge - traffic lights must be obeyed even when bridge is down. Do not pass under bridge if 3 red lights are showing. There is a waiting pontoon by the bridge.</p>
<p>All boats must move at 'Dead Slow' speed in the harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Berthing - Portland</strong> A new marina has been contsructed on the northern side of this huge harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong> In settled weather, there is plenty of room to anchor in Weymouth Bay north of the Weymouth harbour entrance.</p>
