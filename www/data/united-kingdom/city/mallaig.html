<div class="hello"><div><p>Mallaig is a fascinating place. It is a working port, being  a ferry terminal for Skye and the Small Isles and it is the port that forms the main focus of the activity of the town. </p>
<p>It lies at the end of the evocatively named "Road to the Isles." It is also the terminus for the West Highland Railway from Fort William which runs a regular steam train service in addition to the more mundane diesel electric hauled trains.</p>
