<div class="hello"><div><p>Approach
The yachtsman making his first approach to, would be best sticking to within two hours either side of high water, and not to make any approach at all in strong onshore conditions. The Harbour can be found and identified by Pendinas, a conspicuous hill 120m high, with Wellington monument at crest.  Full pilotage directions are now given:</p>
<p>In the approach to Aberystwyth from the North attention should be paid to the Sarn Cynfelyn and Cynfelyn shallow patches. These have minimum depth of 1.5 m over them, and are marked clear of their their western extremity by a westerly Cardinal buoy The Patches (Q(9)15s). In any kind of unsettled weather these should be given a good offing.</p>
<p>The only visitors berths at Aberystwyth are within the dredged Marina,  where the boat will remain afloat.</p>
