<div class="hello"><div><p>This huge estuary on England's north east coast, is approximately 6 miles wide just past its entrance at Spurn Point, narrowing to 1.5 miles some 30 miles upriver. This vast expanse of open water, with its fast-flowing currents, shifting sands and shallow waters, can be a dangerous place and should be treated with respect. Yachtsmen are advised to obtain the latest charts, which are available from the Harbour Master's office.</p>
<p>The old fishing port of Grimsby is on the eastern side of the river about 2nm fron the entrance, while the city of Hull is on the northern shore 20nm up river.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Humber Estuary is home to a thriving community of marinas and small boat clubs as well as the important ports of Grimsby  and Hull. Consequently, this is a very busy stretch of water. </span></p>
<p><span>Always report your presence in the river at night or in poor visibility to VTS Humber of VHF ch 12.</span></p>
<p><span> For yachts arriving off Grimsby in inclement weather, local advice is to call the lock keepers by VHF to see if it is possible to enter the lock pit or seek temporary shelter in the Royal Dock Basin. As this is a busy commercial dock, it is essential not to enter the Royal Dock Basin without permission</span></p>
<p>The deepwater channel to Grimsby is well marked and most yachts should have no trouble following the outer edge of the marked channel. During the day the prominent Victorian Dock Tower is an obvious landmark, which is normally floodlit at night.</p>
<p>Access through the lock is on a free-flow basis on a level for 2 hours before and after high water. Essential to call Lock Keepers on Ch 74 to seek permission to enter the lock. There is a traffic light system displayed on the conspicuous lattice framework on the western side of the lock. 3 greens indicate safe passage through the lock. It is possible to pen into the lock (only with permission) for additional 2 hours either side of high water. At Spring tides the lock gates may close for a period at high water. When transitting the lock, its helpful to keep the engine at fairly high revs as some turbulance may occur. Once through the lock, the marina entrance is dead ahead. Visitors moorings are on your port side on long pontoon running in front of clubhouse.</p>

      There is 1.5m at about  HW +/-2hrs. It starts to dry at about half tide, but it is well protected and little risk of bumping the ground.  The seaward end of the channel is about 5 cables upstream of Haile Sand Fort and is marked by a post painted red and black. There are a few moorings available and limited facilities are available during the season.
