<div class="hello"><div><p>The River Orwell flows through the county of Suffolk in England. It broadens into an estuary at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/UnitedKingdom/Ipswich">Ipswich</a></strong> and then flows into the North Sea at Felixstowe after joining with the River Stour at Shotley.</p>
<p><span>Harwich is positioned on the estuaries of the </span>Stour<span> and </span>Orwell<span> rivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Harwich/River Orwell and the surrounding port (including Felixstowe) is a very active area for shipping and for large, high-speed ferries. It is very important that yachts follow the yacht track and stay well clear of the main channel. Also, though Harwich has a customs port, other marinas on the River Orwell (particularly Ipswich) have clearance facilities and it may be advisable to use them rather than bother with the busy-ness and traffic of the Harwich port.</span></p></div></div>
