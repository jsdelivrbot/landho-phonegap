<div class="hello"><div><p>Boats need to purchase a permit, whose cost depends on the length of time one intends to spend in the canal, which offers attractive cruising opportunities. There are good facilities along its entire length.</p>
<p>You can download application forms and latest licence fees, as well as the Skipper's Guide, at <a href="http://www.waterscape.com/Caledonian_Canal">www.waterscape.com</a></p>
<p>The locks are generally open:-</p>
<p><em>Winter</em> 0900-1600(Mon-Fri)</p>
<p><em>Other seasons</em> 0800-1730 (Mon-Sun)</p>
<p>The locks and bridgers operate on VHF channel 74.</p>
<p>All boats must have third party insurance for 1 million pounds sterling and may be subject to safety checks on gas, fuel and electrical installations. If staying in the canal for more than 28 days, the boat must obtain a Boat Safety Certificate.</p></div></div>
