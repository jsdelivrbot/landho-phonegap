<div><p><strong>Immigration</strong>: Non-EU citizen must report to Immigration. See the <a href="Countries/UnitedKingdom?rc=Formalities#Immigration" target="_blank"><strong>Immigration section</strong></a> below.</p>
<p><span>Anyone on board who is </span><strong>not an EU national</strong><span> must obtain permission to enter the UK from an Immigration officer. The Customs officer to whom you report your arrival to will be able to advise on contacting the nearest Immigration office.</span></p>
<p><strong>Customs</strong>: As a member of the European Union, EU regulations apply. Boats arriving from another EU country do not need to fly the Q flag and need only contact Customs if you have goods to declare,  have non-EU nationals, birds or animals on board.</p>
<p><span>See this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-8-sailing-your-pleasure-craft-to-and-from-the-uk/notice-8-sailing-your-pleasure-craft-to-and-from-the-uk"><strong>official UK website</strong></a> for the latest information for arriving yachts.</span></p>
<p>Briefly, if you are arriving from outside the EU (and<strong> this includes the Channel Islands</strong>) you must fly the ‘Q’ flag, where it can readily be seen, as soon as you enter UK waters (the 12 mile limit). <span>At night the flag should be illuminated.</span> Do not take down the flag until clearance is complete.</p>
<p>Telephone the National Yachtline on +44(0)845 723 1110 on arrival. <span>You will need to comply with any instructions that you are given.</span></p>
<p>Except for contacting the Customs authorities, you must not land goods, persons, or animals or transfer them to another vessel until cleared by Customs.</p>
<p><strong>Good to be declared</strong></p>
<p><span>Any animals or birds, firearms, </span><span>any prohibited and restricted goods including certain foodstuffs (particularly any of non-EU origin). See <a href="Countries/UnitedKingdom?rc=Formalities#Customs"><strong>Customs</strong></a> section below for more details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pets cannot be landed anywhere in the U.K when arriving on a private yacht.</p>
<p><strong>Health Clearance</strong></p>
<p>If there are animals or birds on board or any illness, health clearance must be obtained. The captain should contact the port health authority or local authority responsible for port health control by radio, 4 to 12 hours before arrival and, if this is not possible, immediately on arrival. Until health clearance is given <strong>no one</strong>, except officials, may board the vessel nor anyone leave.</p>
<p>On arrival in a place where there is a Customs house, the captain must notify Customs in person or by telephone. Notification must be made within two hours of arrival, unless arriving between 2300 and 0600, when arrival need not be notified until 0800 the following morning <strong>provided</strong> there are no birds or animals on board.</p>
<p>If notification of arrival is required, then it must be done prior to or within 2 hours of arrival.</p>
<p>Anyone on board who is <strong>not an EU national</strong> must obtain permission to enter the UK from an Immigration officer. The Customs officer to whom you report your arrival to will be able to advise on contacting the nearest Immigration office.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>Customs need not be informed by boats leaving the UK for another EU country.</p>
<p>All boats going directly to a country outside the EU must inform Customs.</p>
<p>Departing boats should complete sections 1 and 2 of Form C1331 (available at marina and port offices) and return part 1 to Customs either by handing it to a Customs officer; placing it in a Customs post box (sited at most marinas), or taking (or posting) it to a Customs office.</p>
<p>Part 2 of this form should be kept on board as evidence of notification of departure. If a planned departure is delayed by more than 48 hours or abandoned, Customs must be informed accordingly. Form C1331 can be obtained from any Customs office, most yacht clubs and marinas, the National Advice Service (0845 010 9000), or online (as Adobe pdf document) from a link at <strong><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/c1331.pdf">HMRC Customs</a></strong></p>

<div><p>All crew must have a passport valid for the length of their stay,</p>
<p>The U.K. is <strong>not</strong> part of the Schengen Area.</p>
<p>Nationals of countries who do not need a visa, are normally granted a stay of a maximum 6 months if they can show sufficient funds.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/" target="_blank"><strong>U.K.Border Agency</strong></a> website for the current list of nationals requiring a visa.</p>

<p>Visas must be obtained in advance from a British embassy or consulate. Persons requiring visas who arrive in the UK without one will be refused entry.</p>
<p>Permission to enter is at the discretion of the Immigration officer at the point of entry - he has the power to refuse entry even if one has a visa, although for those on a tourist visit with sufficient funds for their stay, entry is normally straightforward.</p>
<p>If there is anyone on board who is not an EU national, Immigration must be contacted if arriving from outside the following countries or territories: UK, Isle of Man, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands. In most yachting centres, the Customs officer also acts as the Immigration officer.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>Immigration does not have to be notified when leaving the UK if the destination port is in the EU or Channel Islands.</p>
<p>If the first port of call will be outside the EU, you need to notify an Immigration officer only if there is someone on board who is not an EU resident.</p>
<p>Note that CUSTOMS must be informed if leaving for a non-EU port, irrespective of the nationality of the crew.</p>

<div><p>The U.K. is free of rabies and the control and quarantine of animals is taken seriously.</p>
<p><span>Only certain transport companies and routes can be used to bring pet dogs, cats and ferrets into Great Britain under the Pet Travel Scheme. These are known as approved routes. This means they have been approved by APHA to bring pets into Great Britain under the Pet Travel Scheme and as part of that approval, are responsible for checking that the animal meets the rules of the Scheme</span></p>
<p>It is, therefore, <b>not possible</b> to bring your pet into the UK on board a private yacht, even if your pet does comply with the Pet Travel Scheme.</p>
