<div><p><span>Before arriving at Ascension Island, yachts need to submit an <a href="http://www.ascension-island.gov.ac/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ascension-island-tourist-entry-permit.pdf"><strong>Entry Permit Application</strong></a> and email it to </span><a href="mailto:aig.admin@ascension.gov.ac" target="_blank">aig.admin@ascension.gov.ac</a> at least 28 days before arrival. F<span>axing the permit from St. Helena might be the best option as, officially, you only have a window of up to 72 hours after your stated arrival and departure dates for the permit to be valid.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>On Arrival</strong></span></p>
<p>You will need to contact ‘Ascension Island Radio’ on channel 16 to advise of your arrival, they will then instruct you to contact the port authorities – call sign ‘Port Control’ – who will instruct you from there. <span>Ascension Radio operates VHF on Channel 16 for 24 hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></p>
<p>There are NO moorings available for use by yachts (they are all privately owned and maintained) so you will need to anchor in the northern part of Clarence Bay. PLEASE be aware of the floating hose line that is secured in this area, the hose is connected at each end to moorings <i>however the middle can and does move quite significantly and also has <span>vertical metal posts intermittently along its length</span>,</i> so be sure to leave sufficient space.</p>
<p><span>Do not anchor anywhere which could obstruct the arrival and departure of ships or the unloading of cargo.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/ascension-island-pics/AscensionIsland_Pierheadsteps.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/></p>
<p><i>Pier head steps</i></p>
<p>Be aware that much of the anchorage is foul ground, so take care when setting your anchor. Anchoring in depths &gt;15m both reduces the effect of the swell and the chances of fouling your anchor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong></p>
<p><span>There is no water taxi service available and all landing must be at the main pier head steps, Georgetown – landing on the beaches is strictly prohibited. </span></p>
<p><span>After landing at the steps dinghies must be held away from the steps. Use a long painter tied to the Span (not the landing steps) and use a weight (NOT an anchor) on a stern line to hold the dinghy away from the landing. </span></p>
<p><span>If there is a ship in port, then a ferry shuttle is available (call on VHF channel 08). </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Clearance</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><b>You MUST have exit papers from your last port-of-call.</b> Without them, you cannot stop here.</strong></span></p>
<p>An Entry Permit Fee per person is payable at the Police Office (including children under 12). See <a href="Countries/AscensionIsland?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>fees</strong></a> below.</p>
<p>After reporting your<span> arrival to Ascension Radio on VHF Channel 16, Ascension Radio will notify the Shipping Officer during day light hours by telephone and that Office will make contact with the yacht and arrange a time for the skipper to come ashore to register.</span></p>
<p><span>When registering, the Skipper should take ashore details of the vessel, a crew list and crew passports. No person may leave the yacht at Ascension without the prior permission of the Administrator.</span></p>
<p>Permission is normally given for a yacht to remain for any reasonable period and for the crew to come ashore between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm unless they have a special pass issued by the Police to stay ashore overnight. The pass will give details of the Island Sponsor with whom the visitor must stay. Sleeping rough on shore is not permitted. Applications for passes will not be accepted after office closing hours.</p>
<p><strong>Important Points</strong></p>
<p>The Skipper and all crew members are required to take out Medical Insurance to cover medical costs which must include provision for medical evacuation. It is strongly recommended that medical insurance is taken out in advance as there is no guarantee that cover can be arranged locally and all persons are required to have medical insurance before being allowed ashore.</p>
<p>Animals are not allowed ashore.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the<strong> <a href="http://www.ascension-island.gov.ac/visiting-the-island/">official website</a></strong> before visiting the island, including the page, 'Information for yachtsmen' in the 'Further Info' section.</p>
<p>If a hire car is required, then this will need to be booked in advance through <span>the Tourist Information Office on </span><a href="mailto:tourism@ascension.gov.ac" target="_blank">tourism@ascension.gov.ac</a></p>
