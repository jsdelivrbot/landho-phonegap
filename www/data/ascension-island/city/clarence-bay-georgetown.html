<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/ascension-island-pics/ascension-island-anchorage/@@images/image/preview"/>This tiny island is volcanic, and its lower slopes are of volcanic ash with little vegetation. Green Mountain, in the centre of the island, rises to 2,818 feet and is now covered with plants and shrubs introduced in the 1800's.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is best to avoid arriving at night as there are moorings and mooring lines all over the place, in addition, a floating pipeline is a serious hazard.</p>
<p><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/ascension-island-pics/AscensionIslandpipeline.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/></p>
<p>View of the floating pipeline :©<span>Ascension Island Tourism</span></p>
<p><span>Entering from 7° 55.28' S, 14° 25.66' W to the anchorage (7°55.2' S, 14°.24.7' W) keeps you well clear of the pipe.</span></p>
<p>Visiting Yachts must use their own anchor and not pick up one of the vacant mooring buoys. They should anchor to the NE of the Pierhead, in front of the local boat moorings. The depth is 10-12 metres on a sandy bottom, with good holding. Anchoring too close to the beach should be avoided as the bottom is fine sand over rock and there is alot of chain debris.</p>
<p>Landing is at the Pierhead steps only,  and must not be attempted on the beaches.</p>

<p>Swell is occasionally a problem making landing at the Pierhead a challenge. Landing may be impossible for several days if the rollers are from a northerly direction (rare). Under such circumstances, permission may be requested from Ascension Port Control to land crew at Comfortless Cove (7S 54.6 14W 24.1), a small sheltered sandy bay. This is however 2.5km walk from Georgetown and is impractical unless the need to go ashore is urgent.</p>
<p>There is a facilities building with toilet, showers and washing machine and also a (metered) water tap close to the pierhead.</p>
