<li><img class="image-right" src="Countries/ascension-island-pics/AscensionIslandFrigatebird.png/@@images/image/mini"/><span>A mountainous peak rising from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, Ascension is a dormant volcanic island like </span><a href="Countries/TristandaCunha"><strong>Tristan da Cunha</strong></a><span> and the </span><a href="Countries/Azores"><strong>Azores</strong></a><span> on the mid-Atlantic volcanic ridge.</span></li>
<li>Ascension Island is part of a British Overseas Territory, (nowadays called St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) under the sovereignty of the British Crown.</li>
<li><span>The 34 sq mile (88 sq km) island is a communications centre for Cable &amp; Wireless, the BBC, the RAF, the US Air Force and the European Ariane project.</span></li>
<li>Although a traditional port of call for ships on the Cape of Good Hope route, the few yachts that sail on this route only occasionally stop at Ascension. Because of their isolation, the people who work on the island are friendly and hospitable.</li>
<li>By 2017 Ascension Island will become the <span>Atlantic's largest marine reserve.</span> </li>
