<div><ul>
<li>The two ports of entry, Massawa and Assab are located at either end of the country, so boats sailing in either direction can clear into Eritrea at one of the ports, daysail along the coast and then clear out at the other end. </li>
<li>It is possible to cruise along the entire Eritrean coast in easy stages by exploring countless anchorages and offshore islands. Because of the lack of navigation aids, daysailing is strongly recommended, especially if staying close inshore. </li>
<li>Massawa is the largest natural deepwater harbour on the Red Sea. Within it lies the Dahlek Archipelago, a group of hundreds of islands and islets, which is a protected Marine Park. <span>Cruisers report that this area offers beautiful winter cruising.</span></li>
<li>An interesting side trip for those stopping in Massawa is to the inland capital of Asmara.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Repair facilities are limited, although there are small boatyards and workshops that will be able to carry out simple repairs. In Massawa a local man (Mike) visits boats and offers to do laundry, help with provisioning, etc.</li>
