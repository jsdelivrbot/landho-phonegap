<div class="hello"><div><p>Because of the constant surge, coming alongside the dock can be dangerous, so it is advisable to anchor in the lee of the seawall. Officials rarely board yachts and formalities will be completed ashore. Assab should only be considered if the winds are unfavourable. There is little protection from strong southerlies and with these winds it is best to continue to Massawa.</p>
<p>Report to the port Immigration office for clearance. Visas can be obtained here.</p>
