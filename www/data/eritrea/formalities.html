<div><p>The authorities should be contacted by radio before entering any port. Yachts have reported stopping in anchorages on the way to Massawa before clearing in without experiencing problems.</p>

<p>Entry formalities have to be completed again at each port of entry even if one has cleared into Eritrea already.</p>
<p>No agent is needed.</p>
<p>A 48 hour shore pass will be issued by the Port authority when you first check in and checked at the port gate on entry and exit.</p>

<div><p>A 48 hour shore pass will be issued upon arrival. For longer stays or travel inland, a visa is required. A 30 day visa can be obtained in Adaga (3km north of Massawa) for US$50 per person. Processing of visas is slow as it is done by computer and power cuts are frequent.</p>
