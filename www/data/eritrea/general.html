<div><p>International dialing code for Eritrea is +291.</p>
<p>European GSM900 and GSM1800 phones do not function in Eritrea. In this case, GSM1900 or Nextel phones do not provide coverage as well. One of the solutions offered by Telecom Rentcenter is the rental of Thuraya satellite phones. KPN and Vodafone subscribers can keep using their own GSM phone number in Eritrea by putting their SIM card in a Thuraya satellite phone. It is important to note that Thuraya phones do only function when used in open air.</p>
