<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts are invited to come around to the Royal Belau Yacht Club anchorage <strong>AFTER</strong> they have completed Vessel Entry Clearance. The Club can assist with finding a suitable anchorage or available mooring. A useful aerial photograph of this anchorage with marked hazards and anchoring zones can be seen <a href="images/malakal-yacht-harbour-palau-1/view"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In the main harbour yachts should not anchor to the north of the northern port wall as there is a giant clam population there. There is a spot about 30 feet deep near the N/NE corner of the port wall (south of two old anchored tugs) which has good holding (it is around 50-70 feet deep elsewhere).  Sometimes it is possible to tie up to the port wall if there is room, contact Port Control on VHF Ch 16 first.</p>

<p>There are moorings available in front of Sam's Tours.</p>
<p>Showers, trash disposal, bar and restaurant and fuel are also all available here. at the yacht club.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sam’s Tours and Royal Belau Yacht Club</span> are located on the WEST SIDE of Malakal Harbor, west of Malakal Island in a small cove that offers good shelter and holding ground for cruising yacht anchorage. Although no channel is shown on charts of the cove, there is a small channel marked with flashing red and green markers. The center of the channel (GPS 07° 20.25' N x 134° 27.02' E) carries a minimum low tide depth of 12 feet.</p>
<p>The Royal Belau Yacht Club has a busy social programme and welcomes visiting sailors. Its members are the best source if help is needed.</p></div></div>
