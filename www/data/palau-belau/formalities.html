            </h2>
<div><p>Yachts inbound to Palau are invited to contact the Royal Belau Yacht Club at <a href="http://www.samstours.com"><strong>Sams Tours</strong></a> for information and or assistance with Entry Clearance. <span>Send your vessel details to </span><a href="mailto:rbyc@samstours.com">rbyc@samstours.com</a><span> with list of your last 3 ports, your next port, crew list and ETA and RBYC will provide courtesy notice to authorities of your pending arrival. </span>There is no charge for their assistance.</p>

<p>Palau Port Control monitors VHF Channel 16  from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday. Vessels must <strong>CHECK IN</strong> immediately upon arrival <span>at the official Port of Entry on the East side of Malakal Harbour at the Commercial Dock.</span> Call +680 775 0419 or +680 488 5789 to contact Port Control Duty Officer.</p>
<p><span> </span><strong>Anchoring before Clearing In is prohibited.</strong></p>
<p class="Style"><strong>Arriving vessels must contact Palau Port Control on VHF Channel 16 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> mooring at the Commercial Dock.</strong></p>
<p class="Style">Do not enter the harbour in the dark or in poor conditions  as paper and electronic charts are not accurate for Palau. The GPS position for CHECK IN at the Commercial Dock is: 07° 19.84' N , 134° 27.48' E.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>A yacht may not stop at any other place before clearing in at Malakal, unless the Chief of Immigration grants permission, if it is in the public interest of that place or an emergency situation.</p>
<p>A yacht in distress may anchor or land at any port in Palau but must immediately notify the nearest government official to contact the Chief of Immigration. Yachts stopping anywhere else other than Malakal will be instructed to proceed to Malakal immediately. It is very important to keep in touch with the Authorities.</p>

<p>Be prepared for lots of Government officials to participate in Vessel Entry Clearance.

<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
