<div class="hello"><div><p>Take great care when entering this extremely busy port. Keep well clear of all the jetties. Watch for the signals indicating large tanker movements, when entry/exit is not allowed without permission.</p>
<p><span>To reach the marina, it is necessary to pass right  though the commercial port - 2nm avoiding some VERY big ships. The sailing club's yachthaven is to port, at the southern end of the harbour, beyond the Military Dock no. 2.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Bruges</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The sea lock here gives access to the Boudewijnkannal which allows masted yachts to transit the 6 miles to the suburbs of Bruges. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At Bruges, the Brugse Zeil- en Yachtclub has a marina with visitor berths. The marina is about a 40 minutes walk from the city centre, so bikes are useful..</span><br/><br/><span>The Boudewijn canal can be accessed by using either of the two sealocks in Zeebrugge. To obtain lock times, call on VHF 68 or telephone 050543231.  Both are big commercial locks and they are only opened for yachts when there is commercial shipping.</span><br/><br/><span>The small lock, "Lock Visart" is on the western side of Zeebrugge harbour and is only opened during the day on weekdays. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After passing through the lock, call "Railway Bridge" on VHF 68. The distance to the railway bridge is 2.5 miles but it will take between 20 and 40 minutes to get it opened due to busy railway traffic. There is also a road bridge that will be opened together with railway bridge. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The marina is just before the town on left hand side (eastern side).</span><br/><br/><span>The big lock "Lock Vandamme" is open 24H. After passing the lock, turn right and pass a small bridge. This bridge is controlled by lock operators and it will probably be already opened for you. Then continue south as described earlier. Note that during onshore winds the swell from North Sea will enter Zeebrugge harbour and the lock when the lock gate is open.</span><br/><br/><span>On the way back to Zeebrugge is advisable to call the lock and confirm the lockage times before leaving Bruges. The lock times are very definite (lock doors closing) and you should plan to arrive 20 minutes beforehand. There are no waiting pontoons near the locks.</span></span></span></p>
