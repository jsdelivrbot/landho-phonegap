<div class="hello"><div><p>The best shelter here is in the Mercator Yacht Harbour, accessed through the Montgomery Dock and lock. There are also berths in the Montgomery Dock itself and at the welcoming Royal Oostende YC, a mile or so up the river.</p>
<p>Beware of the strong tides along this coast, as well as the frequent ferry movements. It is not an entrance to be happily approached in on-shore winds over F6 as the seas can break on the off shore sand banks.</p>
<p>25/30 piles have been driven either side of the entrance to Montgomery Dock from the fairway to reduce the effects of wash and swell in the Royal North Sea YC Basin. As a consequence the entrance is much narrower.</p>
