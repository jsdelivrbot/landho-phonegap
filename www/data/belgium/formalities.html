<div><p>The importation of hunting and sporting firearms is possible but prior authorisation and licences must be obtained prior to arrival. They must be declared to Customs on arrival.</p>
<p>Foreign yachts remaining more than two months in Belgium must obtain a registration plate, as all Belgian yachts have, and pay navigation dues. Further details can be obtained from the Bureau de Perception des Droits de Navigation. The registration plate allows a vessel to stop on navigable waterways or to use their tributaries.</p>
<p>EU regulations apply concerning temporary importation. See <strong><a href="../../General/EuropeanUnion/VAT">EU VAT</a> </strong>page for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on Red (marked) Diesel:-</strong></p>
<p>The concession which permits <span>British leisure craft to have red diesel in their fuel tanks when visiting Belgian waters was not renewed after 31st December 2014. This means that <span>the use of marked “red” diesel in a private pleasure craft is unlawful regardless of the country in which the diesel was purchased and is an infringement of Belgian law which carries the risk of a fine.</span></span></p>
<p>It is strongly advised that foreign yachts which have any red diesel in their tanks or on board, to have receipts (no more than a year old) showing that the tax on it has been paid.</p>

<p><em>Navigation</em>: When motorsailing, a black cone with its apex down must be hoisted in the rigging. Port entry signals must be obeyed, due to the very heavy shipping traffic in and out of ports.</p>

There are maximum speed limits on many of the canals and rivers. Vessels must not sail within 60 ft (20 m) of the banks of the River Meuse and the Ghent-Terneuzen canal, and within 25 ft (8 m) on the Lys and the Brussels - Charleroi canal. Full details of the regulations can be obtained in the booklet "Dispositions reglementant la police et la navigation", available from the offices at the locks. Information is also obtainable from the Ministère des Travaux Publics.</p>
<p>Foreign yachts arriving in Belgium by one of the canals must report to the first navigation tax office, to complete an entry declaration. On departure an exit declaration must also be signed at a navigation tax office. These offices are situated at the locks.</p></div>
