<div class="hello"><div><p>Upon radioing to enter the port of Djibouti you will be met and escorted in by a coastguard launch and a heavily armed RIB of a French naval vessel.</p>
<p>Formalities are reported to be straightforward.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Yacht Club of Djibouti has now been closed. If there is space available, visiting yachts are docked on the floating pontoons in front of the former yacht club building.</p>
<p><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/djibouti-pics/djibouti_harbour-anchorage/@@images/image/preview"/></p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor inside the Port <i>(see photo courtesy of SY Alytes who visited in 2016)</i>. <span>Good holding in mud at </span><span>about 4.5m (N 11°35,953  043°07,908). </span></p>
<p>On request, dinghies can be safely left at the red and white Coast Guard dock on the north-western end of the fishing harbour. <span>If you leave your dinghy in the fishing harbour itself, it is recommended to </span><span>hire a guard </span><span>for 100 to 200 </span><span>francs per day.</span></p>
<p>Obtaining fuel here is not easy. The main wharf has a high volume of traffic bringing in food supplies and refugees so it is likely access to the wharf for fuelling will be denied. There is a petrol station nearby and jerry cans can be trucked to your dinghy.</p>
