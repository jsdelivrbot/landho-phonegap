            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Djibouti used to be a convenient port of call for both east or westbound yachts. Those bound for the Mediterranean arrive in Djibouti during the NE monsoon, mainly between January and March.</li>
<li>The French maintain a naval base in the port which means that provisioning is good, better than Aden, although more expensive.</li>
<li>Repair facilities for yachts are rather limited, although there are a few workshops capable of carrying out simple repairs.</li>

<div><p>Current security advice is to check an travel advisory site such as <span>the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/djibouti"><strong>UK FCO website</strong></a><span> for the latest travel advice.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the </span><a href="http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home" rel="external">designated High Risk Area</a><span> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sailing within 1,000 miles of the Somalian coast is not advisable.</span></p>
