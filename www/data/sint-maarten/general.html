<div><p>International dialing code for Sint Maarten is +1 721.</p>
<p>Cellular phones - There are several digital cell phone systems in place. Telcell and UTS (Chippie) on the Dutch side have GSM services. The French side has GSM services through Orange (France Telecom) and Amigo (Dauphin). You need a triband GSM phone and a SIM card of the local provider for using these services.  Buying a prepaid phone card is easy. Many shops, supermarkets and gas stations sell pre-paid phone cards for the Dutch side providers. All networks cover both sides of the island.</p>
<p><b>Four Star Cargo</b><span> - alongside the airport on the way to Maho - can have anything shipped to their address in Miami and they will automatically have it sent by cargo ship or air (your choice) to their warehouse in St. Maarten. Free to open an account, you pay the shipping fees when you pick up your package. They will also deliver island-wide.</span></p></div>

<div><p><strong>Car Rental</strong><br/> The island is well serviced by both internationally known companies such as Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty, Budget and Avis and numerous local firms.</p>
<p><span><strong>Airport</strong></span><br/>Princess Juliana International Airport (also known as Saint Martin International Airport) serves the Dutch part of the island of Saint Martin. <span>The airport is perhaps best known for </span><span>very low-altitude flyover landing approaches</span><span> due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and </span><span>Maho Beach</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a bus stop right outside the Terminal so you do not have to take an expensive taxi ($20 to Simpson Bay). The bus is $2.50 all the way to Phillipsburg.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively you can collect your crew by dinghy. <span>The small marina which houses the Pink Iguana and Crazy Cow sometimes permit dinghy landing. Ask </span><span class="text_exposed_show">permission in the Crazy Cow, or Pink Iguana if its open. Dinghies can also be left on the old Customs dock close to the runway.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>There is also an airport on the French side of the island, called </span><span>Aéroport de Grand Case or L'Espérance Airport</span><span>. This is used for local and regional flights only.</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><b>Buses</b></span></p>
<p>The minibus system here is simple and cheap. Minibuses are easily recognizable, due to wooden placards with a name of a city visible on the dashboard. For example, in Philipsburg, the capital of the Dutch side, you may spot a minibus with a “French Quarter” sign sitting on the dashboard. <span>A 10-to-15-minute bus ride from Philipsburg to the French Quarter costs $2 (</span><span class="st">€</span><span>2) per person. Once there, you can disembark and locate a bus heading in the direction of Marigot, the capital of the French side.</span></p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, if you are riding the bus for more than or equal to 10 minutes, then you will pay $2. If you use the bus for only a short distance, then you can simply pay the driver $1.</p>
<p>Dollars and Euros are both accepted, and the buses use a 1-to-1 currency ratio.</p>
