<div><p>All vessels arriving in or departing from St. Maarten waters must clear in and out with the Immigration Department. This can be done either in Great Bay or Simpson Bay, as follows:-</p>
<p><strong>Great Bay:</strong> The Immigration Department is located just outside the port gates on the right hand side. The office is open from 07:00 to 18:00hrs 7 days a week. <br/> The Clearance Office is open 08:00 to 12:00hrs and 13:00 to 16:30hrs Monday to Friday and from 09:00 to 12:00hrs on Saturday and Sunday. It is closed on public holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Simpson Bay:</strong> The Immigration Department is located in the Police Station  adjacent the channel into Simpson Bay Lagoon. The Immigration Department is open every day from 08:00 to 18:00 hours. The Clearance Office is open Monday to Friday from 08:00 to 12:00 hours and 13:00 to 16:30 hours. It is closed at weekends. However, you can clear out in advance or at Great Bay. The Immigration Department monitors VHF Channel 12.</p>
<p>Also check in with the Simpson Bay Lagoon Authority (open 08:30-17:00 daily). A fee is charged whether you go into the lagoon or not.</p>
<p>A fee is charged on clearing out.</p>
<p>On the French side, the procedure for clearing in and out is the same, <strong>but</strong> the fees are less (see <a href="Countries/StMartin/?rc=Formalities#Fees">St Martin page</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The <code>waiver of liability</code> form required before a vessel can pass through the Simpson Bay Bridge, can be obtained from the Clearance Office.</p>
<p>There is a fee for passing through the bridge and a weekly charge for anchoring. This only applies when entering from the Dutch side of the island (see comments at bottom of page).</p>
<p>It has been reported to Noonsite that the Authorities on the Dutch side are known to board boats at anchor and check documents as well as safety equipment. This also applies to any unlit vessels (including dinghies) at night.</p>

<div><p>A valid passport is necessary for all nationalities, valid for the length of stay.</p>
<p>French St Martin and Dutch Sint Maarten have now coordinated their visa policies.</p>
<p>Citizens of most European countries, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and several other countries do not require a visa.</p>
<p><span>See the </span><strong><a href="http://www.sintmaartengov.org/Government%20Forms/travelguide.pdf">Official Sint Maarten Government website</a> </strong>for the full list of who does, and who does not require a visa.</p>
<p>All children require a visa.</p>
<p>For Dutch nationals, maximum stay allowed is 6 months uninterrupted with the possibility to extend it.</p>
<p>For nationals of the United States of America, Canada, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; maximum stay allowed is 3 months uninterrupted with the possibility to extend.</p>
<p>Captains who find it necessary to apply for crew visas should contact a St. Maarten ships agent for information on obtaining pre-approval through the Foreign Affairs Office for a possible 1 year, multiple entry crew visa.</p>
<p>In general, visiting yachtsmen are permitted to stay on the island for a maximum period of three months. This will sometimes vary according to nationality and so it is best to enquire when clearing in.</p>
<p>Crew joining a boat have sometimes experienced difficulty with Immigration officials if they are unable to show an onward ticket. Captains of yachts expecting crew are advised to contact Immigration in advance.</p>
<p>Outward clearance papers are necessary if sailing to another island, even another Dutch one, though not if sailing across to French St Martin.</p>
