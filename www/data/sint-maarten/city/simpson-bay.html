<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There is a dinghy dock outside Customs and Immigration. Free Garbage disposal is on the Customs dock too. There is also some space for dinghies on the yacht club dock, however this is very restricted (see Yacht Club information below).</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the marinas in the Simpson Bay Lagoon are aimed at the mega-yacht market. </span></p>
<p><strong>Simpson Bay Bridge (Dutch side)</strong><br/> This is the main access into and out of Simpson Bay Lagoon from the Dutch side of the island.  The bridge is located in Simpson Bay and will accommodate vessels up to a maximum beam of 56 feet (17 meters) and a maximum draft of 17 feet (6 meters).  Wide beamed vessels must request pilotage.</p>
<p>When the bridge is closed there is 8.6 feet (2.6 meters) clearance in the port channel and 8 feet (2.4 meters) clearance in the starboard channel. Note: Clearance may vary depending on the state of the tide.</p>
<p><span><strong>Simpson Bay Causeway Bridge</strong></span><br/> This cross-lagoon causeway bridge is at the head of the Simpson Bay Inlet. The causeway runs from the north of Yacht Club Port de Plaisance to the airport runway. It has a maximum clearance of 28 feet. Vessels with a mast height of more than 28 feet are restricted to the opening centre part of the causeway which will act like a swing bridge.</p>
<p>Vessels transiting the lagoon should stay within the marked channel.</p>
<p>There is a 3mph speed limit for all vessels using the access channel, and within the lagoon all marinas and yacht anchorages are deemed "no wake zones".</p>
<p>Most seasons the bridges open six times during the day in order to handle the vessels that make use of several marinas in the Simpson Bay Lagoon.</p>

<p><strong>Sandy Ground Bridge (French Side)</strong><br/> This bridge is the main access into Simpson Bay Lagoon from the French side of the island. Access is from Marigot Bay and the bridge will accommodate vessels with a maximum beam of 32 feet and a maximum draft of 10 feet. There is a 10-foot clearance when the bridge is closed. There is a 3mph speed limit in the channel.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>09:00 - everyday</span></li>
<li><span>14:30 - Monday - Saturday (excluding holidays)</span></li>
<li><span>17:30 - everyday</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>*Times are subject to change.</span></p>
<p>Reports February 2014 are that there is no monitoring of any VHF channel by this bridge. The official VHF Channel for the Bridge Operator is Ch: 16 Tel: (590) 87 20 43.</p>
<p>Cruisers recommend the best bet to verify times is to hail Shrimpys (morning net controller) on channel 10.</p>
<p><span>Users of small craft are requested not to transit the bridge channels during bridge opening hours. Boats docking at the BBW dock should not be maneuvering in the channel during the bridge operational hours.</span></p>
<p>Jet ski owners and rentals are requested to inform users that they must put their waterspouts off when passing under the bridges. This prevents corrosion of the iron structure.</p>
<p>Captains and owners of vessels after docking their vessels in the lagoon should immediately come to the window of the Simpson Bay Lagoon Authority &amp; Immigration to clear in their vessel, crew and passengers and pay the necessary bridge and harbor fees and dues.</p>
