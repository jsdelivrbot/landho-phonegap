<div class="hello"><div><p>Philipsburg is at the centre of Great Bay on Sint Maarten's SE corner.</p>
<p>Sint Maarten Port Authority have now put in a buoyed channel for marine traffic in Great Bay. It goes to and from the Captain Hodge Wharf and to the marinas in the NE of the Bay. The seaside entrance to the channel has red and green flashing lights and there is a max draft of 7 feet.</p>
<p><span>Position 18° 00'N, 63° 03'W (entrance to the bay)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two marinas in Philipsburg, Great Bay Marina and Bobby's Marina.</p>
<p>Boats that do not wish to use a marina may anchor in Great Bay, although the recent construction of a large cruise ship dock has somewhat restricted the space. It is a busy bay with many jet skis, so it's advisable to anchor some distance out if you don't want to be bothered by them. It can sometimes be quite rolly here. Water and fuel is reasonable and easy to get at Bobby's Marina, where there is a dinghy dock up a little creek next to the marina.</p>
<p>No anchoring is permitted inside the new buoyed channel. Both the channel and the anchorages are "no-wake" zones.</p>
<p>There is an anchoring charge here of approx. $4 a day.</p>
<p>Last updated March 2015.</p></div></div>
