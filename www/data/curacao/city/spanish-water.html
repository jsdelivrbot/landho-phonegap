<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Spanish Water lies about 6nm southeast of Willemstad towards the settlement of Newport on Curacao's southern coast.</span></p>
<p>The<span> rocky shoreline can be tricky with strong tradewinds and the entrance is difficult to spot with breakers everywhere. The narrow opening has no markers, a sandbank on one side and rocks on the other. Definitely not to be attempted at night.</span></p>
<p>Once through the entrance channel, Spanish Water provides a large area of sheltered water, buzzing with activity. <span>There is a strong cruising community here and a good range of yachting services.</span></p>

<p>Boats may tie up to the reception dock at Seru Boca Marina, in the SW corner of Spanish Water or anchor west of the Curaçao Yacht Club. Customs no longer come to Spanish Water, yachts must now go to Punda in the town for clearance, and then to Immigration on the other side of the river, in the cruise ship terminal area.</p>
<p><strong>Customs, Immigration and Harbour Inspection</strong><br/> Within 24 hours you need to check in at Customs and Harbour Immigration. Customs are at Punda at the corner of Handelskade and Capriles Kade, north of the floating bridge and west of the floating market.</p>
<p>Harbour immigration is at Otra-Banda, over the floating bridge to the right, direct under the high bridge.  At the harbour Inspection, in the building next to harbour Immigration, you need to obtain an anchorage permit. They will ask you to mark where you are anchored. Be sure to take all your documents. You should be in one of the permitted anchorages.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Most visiting boats anchor in Spanish Waters Bay, which is well sheltered. Despite the size however, it can be difficult to find space among the forest of masts.</p>
<p><strong>All anchoring</strong> needs permission from the harbour office in Willemstad. It costs $10 USD for 3 days in each anchorage, except Spanish Water where a permission lasts for 3 months.</p>
<p>Click <a href="Noonsite/PDF_Files/SpanishWaterAnchorages"><strong>here</strong></a> for a map of the anchorage areas.</p>
<p><span>It can be difficult to decide exactly where to anchor. Near the dinghy dock means a lot of traffic, in the middle boats pitch relentlessly in the mile-long fetch, and the protected anchorages entail long (wet) dinghy rides. Go ashore with dry bags for your clothes for the return trip, or bathers to change into.</span></p>
<p><span>Many cruisers end up staying here a long time as everything is so convenient. <span>Free shuttles run twice a day to the local supermarkets, a water boat comes by to fill up the tanks, there is a morning radio net for advice, all kinds of activities are organized for and by cruisers and, of course, there’s the daily happy hour.</span></span></p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock at the Fisherman's Harbour dock which is free and has 24hr security. <span>SOV Asiento also has a dinghy dock which is available for 55 guilders/month if you take temporary membership.</span></p>
<p>The Curaçao Yacht Club is only open to members.</p>
<p>An alternative, quieter permitted anchorage can be found east of Spanish Water at Fuik Bay. Anchor in the NE corner in 3 to 4m over mud.</p>
