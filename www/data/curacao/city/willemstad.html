<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Willemstad_harbor1.jpg"/>Willemstad is the capital of Curacao and the most important port in this part of the Caribbean. Its Dutch Colonial style of architecture makes it an attractive town and has caused it to be classed as a World Heritage site (photo of <span>Willemstad Harbour © Wikipedia).</span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>Willemstad consists of Punda on one side and Otra-Banda on the other side.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><a href="Countries/Curacao/SpanishWater/Countries/Curacao/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Curacao/Clearance</strong></a><span> for detailed information about Curacao formalities.</span></p>
<p>At the centre of Willemstad is St Anna Bay, through which all ships pass into the large Schottegat Harbour, past the floating pedestrian bridge which opens for vessels.</p>
<p>Yachts should tie up at the commercial dock on the starboard side of St Anna Bay, which is near Customs and Immigration. The Port Authorities will give berthing instructions. The VHF working channels in Curaçao are 12 and 14.</p>
<p>The Immigration Office (Harbour Police) is located under Queen Juliana Bridge. It should not be confused with the immigration counter at the post office which is for immigrants not yacht crews.</p>
<p>The Harbour Authority is in the same building as Harbour Police.</p>
<p><strong>Customs, Immigration and Harbour Inspection</strong><br/>Within 24 hours you need to check in at Customs and Harbour Immigration. Customs are at Punda at the corner of Handelskade and Capriles Kade, north of the floating bridge and west of the floating market.</p>
<p>Harbour immigration is at Otra-Banda, over the floating bridge to the right, direct under the high bridge. At the harbour Inspection, in the building next to harbour Immigration, you need to obtain an anchorage permit. They will ask you to mark where you are anchored. Be sure to take all your documents. You should be in one of the permitted anchorages.</p>
