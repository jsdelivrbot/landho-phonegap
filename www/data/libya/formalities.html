<div><p><b>Be aware</b><span> that the current situation regarding visits by foreign yachts is currently unknown.</span></p>
<p>If there is an emergency which forces a yacht to call at one of the Libyan ports, an attempt should be made to contact the authorities on VHF Channel 16, 12 or 11 as soon as the yacht enters Libyan territorial waters.</p>
<p>If your arrival is planned, make every effort to arrive on the expected day and still contact the authorities on VHF when entering Libyan waters.</p>
<p>As there is a Libyan law which does not permit foreign ships to retain Israeli flags, stores or literature pertaining to Israel on board, even if these are part of the vessel's navigation equipment, such as Sailing Directions, any such incriminating items should be disposed of before entering a Libyan port. As Libya is a <code>dry</code> country, it is advisable not to have alcohol on board either.</p>
<p>Private yachting is unknown in Libya and dealing with visiting yachts is a new experience for most officials. This can result in being treated as if a large cruise ship; with a large amount of paperwork and disproportionate fees. A local agent with some experience with yachts is to be recommended.</p>
<p>Although a large number of officials are likely to be involved in the clearance procedure, it is usually done in a welcoming and friendly manner. It is useful to have an <code>official</code> ship's stamp.</p>

<div><p><b>July 2016:</b><br/><span>The regulations in force under the current regime are not known.</span></p>
<p>Every visitor needs a visa in advance, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. It should be noted that with a Libyan stamp in a passport, may cause problems going to some other countries.</p>
<p>Entry is refused to Israelis, and those with passports containing stamps from Israel.</p>
<p>The Libyan government announced a new biometric requirement for visa applicants that became effective on December 1, 2008.  This requirement necessitates personal appearance at a Libyan Embassy by all visa applicants.  At present, this change affects only applicants for Libyan visas in London and Paris, but will likely expand to other Libyan embassies in the near future.</p>
<p>Each person (including children) must have a minimum of US$1000 in cash and may be required to show this on entry. It does not have to be changed into Libyan currency.</p>

<div><p>Nothing identifiably Israeli should be on board; neither food, printed matter, equipment or other items. According to one offical website, this also applies to items from South Africa.</p>
<p>Any alcohol will have to be in a sealed locker, although it may be less troublesome to have none on the yacht at all.</p>
<p>Among other items listed which might have to be sealed, are tobacco products, matches, perfume, saccharine, arms and ammunition, pork and pork products.</p>

Immediate cash payment is expected by doctors and hospitals before treatment.  If travelling to the desert, be aware that even with insurance providing international air ambulance cover, such a rescue might not be permitted.</p>

<div><p>Libya is a muslim country. In public, dress conservatively at all times, covering arms, shoulders and legs. Women wearing light cloths would still offend people in rural areas. Men should keep their hats on at all times, especially in front of women, and women should cover their heads when visiting a mosque.</p>
<p>As a courtesy during Ramadan, non-Muslims should be careful not to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours. Greater emphasis is placed on the need to dress and behave modestly.</p>
<p>Take care when taking photographs and do not point your camera at people, unless you have their consent, especially women. Do not take photos of anything remotely military or in the port area.</p></div>
