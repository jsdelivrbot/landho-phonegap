<div><ul>
<li>The most attractive natural cruising areas of Spain are situated at its extremes, the north-west Atlantic coast and the Balearics -  these islands being one of the Mediterranean's prime yachting centres. </li>
<li>Slowly but surely however, anchoring space in the Balearics is being taken up with mooring fields. See news items adjacent for updates on the latest situation.</li>
<li>In the last decade, Spain's Mediterranean coast and islands have seen a tremendous development in yachting facilities with new marinas being built everywhere, so that one is never more than a few hours' sail away from the next harbour.</li>
<li>Good repair facilities can now be found in the majority of Spanish ports, with the most comprehensive, but almost most expensive, being in the prime yachting centres (such as Palma de Mallorca).</li>
<li>Facilities are also good in Barcelona and the surrounding area, where berthing and boatyard charges are surprisingly economical. </li>
<li>The holding of the America's Cup in Valencia, and the Volvo Ocean Race in Alicante, have meant both these ports now have greatly improved yachting facilities. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cruising the Atlantic coast of Spain can be much more rewarding as nature has rewarded this coastline with an abundance of natural harbours and inlets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Facilities in Atlantic Spain tend to be more basic, with boatyards catering to both yachts and commercial boats. On the Atlantic coast there are good facilities at the new Puerto Sherry near Cadiz. On the North West coast the best range is to be found at La Coruña, where the yacht club can be particularly helpful, and in Vigo.</li>
<li>There are chandleries with a good selection in the main sailing centres, but in smaller ports and marinas the availability of spares is limited.</li>
<li>Most Spanish yacht clubs are exclusive social clubs, where visitors are not particularly welcome. Those which have docking facilities operate on a commercial basis charging visitors marina fees. Dress etiquette is strict and a sloppy appearance is frowned upon.</li>
<li>If heading into Portugal from Spain, be sure to top up your tanks before departure as diesel is cheaper in Spain than in Portugal. Note also that diesel is even cheaper in Gibraltar, and cheaper still in Morocco.</li>

<div><p>The climate varies greatly from the Atlantic north coast, which is wet and cool, to the Mediterranean south and east, where summers are very hot and winters mild. The winds are just as varied, the north coast coming under the influence of Atlantic weather systems, with south-westerly to north-westerly winds predominating in winter and northerly winds in summer, although land and sea breezes can be experienced inshore. This is also the case along the south-western coast during summer, while the rest of the year, winds are either easterly or westerly. Alternating sea and land breezes are also characteristic of the Mediterranean coast. The eastern coast and Balearics are occasionally affected by the mistral, a N or NW wind which can rapidly reach gale force.</p>
