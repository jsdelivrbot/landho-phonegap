<ul>
<li>Poland lies on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea wedged between Germany and the Russia, two countries whose territorial ambitions have shaped most of Poland's recent history. Poland was the first East European country to rid itself of Communist rule by democratic means and also put an end to Soviet domination. The process, which started in Poland in the early 1980s, has had reverberations, not only in Europe but all over the world.</li>
<li>Poland became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004.</li>
<li>Cruising in Poland itself is limited to the two sailing areas around the ports of Szczecin and Gdynia, the former in the estuary of the river Oder (Odra), the latter on the western shore of the Gulf of Gdansk.</li>
<li>Yachting facilities have improved greatly in recent years. There are many yacht clubs that may be good sources of information if help is needed. Best yachting facilities are in the marinas at Szczecin, Trzebiez, Leba, Gdynia, Gdansk and Gorki Zachodnie,  where there are considerable local sailing communities. There are good marinas in Gdynia, which is municipal and has four yacht clubs, and in Gdansk on Motlawa River in the city centre.</li>
<li>Facilities in Swinoujscie are very limited. Better facilities are available at Szczecin where there are two marinas and several yacht clubs.</li>
<li>Repair facilities also exist in Kolobrzeg yacht harbour, 50 miles east of Swinoujscie. There is a new marina at Dzwirzyno west of Kolobrzeg.</li>
