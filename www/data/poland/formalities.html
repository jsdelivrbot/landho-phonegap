<div><p>The Q flag is not used, and it is your responsibility to report your arrival.</p>
<p>Foreign boats must check in with Customs and Immigration at all major ports. The authorities should be contacted at Port Control on Channel 16 or working channel (usually 10 or 12) before entering or leaving a port. Details of ship's name, nationality, number of crew and previous or next port of call.  English is understood, but it may be necessary to speak slowly.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs procedures must be completed when arriving or departing from Poland. Official Border Control (check-in) is required on arrival at the first Polish port and similarly on departure from the last Polish port.</p>
<p>For EU members arriving from EU countries, this is only passport control. In practice it is, however, necessary to report in and out of every port in Poland. With the exception of the first and last port, a verbal report over the VHF radio giving boat name, names and nationality, number of persons on board and previous or next port of call appears to be all that is required.</p>
<p>Swinemunde, Ziegenort, Stettin and all larger ports on the Polish coast have Immigration offices or stations.</p>
<p>Only Gdynia and Swinoujcie can be entered under all weather conditions.</p>
<p><em>Peenestrom Channel</em> Yachts coming from Germany through the Stettiner Haff (Zalew Szczecinski in Polish) must show their papers to the Polish patrol boat stationed at the border (marked by buoys) before continuing to Nowe Warpno, Trzebiez or Swinoujscie for clearance.</p>
<p>You must not continue south on the Odra River without clearing in.</p>
