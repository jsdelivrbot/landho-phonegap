<p><span>The marina has all facilities, a restaurant and a fuel berth on the jetty. The yacht club can arrange repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>If entering the Old fishing harbour, beware of the sandbank lying between the to harbours. <span>The approach has lit beacons, and by day you can use the transit towers, but most characteristic point is  the brick church and its tower next to harbour. There is electricity on a jetties. The toilets and harbourmaster's office are in a new building (go upstairs, open only during the day) close to the pontoon.</span></span></p>
