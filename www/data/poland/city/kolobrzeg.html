<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Approaches - the port entrance is 47m wide. The Port canal narrows down to 24m. Depth at the entrance is about 8m. During daylight identification of city is made easy by many tall buildings and enormous dark red basilica dominating town and port. On a sunny day, the white stones of the harbour wall blend in with the beach. Locate the lighthouse and the white building of the Hotel Baltyk, 500m from east wall, then look for entrance. </span></p>
<p><span>At night, the mole heads are both lit and in addition there are powerful lights illuminating the harbour walls. The Kolobrzeg lighthouse is visible for 16 miles. In front of it there is a signal mast visible 0.5M.</span></p>
<p>The marina consists of two basins. Beware of the swell in the narrow entrance in W to NW winds. It can also be subject to cross-currents.</p>
<p>Five miles West and 7 miles East of Kolobrzeg there are small fishing villages. Fishing nets can be found up to 6 miles out to sea.</p>
<p>The illuminated 220m pier on the East side of the harbour is in shallow water. Do not attempt to tie up. From the sea the activity within the port is not visible.</p></div></div>
