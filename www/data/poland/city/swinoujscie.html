<div class="hello"><div><p>Boats clear in at the exposed customs quay, just inside the harbour entrance to port, past the breakwaters but before reaching the first commercial dock.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard and Customs are situated just beyond the base of the long harbour wall on the east side of the harbour entrance. Call Port Control on Channel 12 prior to entering or leaving Port. Great caution should be taken when mooring up to clear Customs as the concrete harbour wall is short and broken and there can be a large swell from passing ships.</p>
<p>After formalities are completed one is allowed to move to the town quay Wladyslawa IV near the navy basin further upriver. In the case of unfavourable weather conditions, boats can get permission to clear in at the town quay (Marina Orion).</p></div></div>

Swinoujscie has a very large commercial and fishing harbour and as a result there is a lot of movement in and out of the harbour and within the port. Look out for local ferries and pleasure boats.
