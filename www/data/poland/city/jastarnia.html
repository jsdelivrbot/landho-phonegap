<div class="hello"><div><p>Jastarnia lies midway along the 33km long thin peninsular extending eastwards from the western shore of the Gulf of Gdansk. It is connected by a railway to the mainland. In places the peninsular is only 200m wide and not much more than a metre high.</p>
<p>The harbour is on the southern shore, but can be a little exposed to swell from that direction. In strong winds from this direction it is b<span>etter to go to Gdynia or Gdansk. <span>The approach to harbour is simple and well marked (buoys, leading light, beacons), but keep to the channel as each side is very shallow. Keep a sharp lookout for a fishing nets.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In northern part of harbour there are three pontoons (two with fingers) with water and electricity. <span>10/15 guest moorings with a maximum draft of 3.5m.</span></span></p>
<p><span>There is free mooring</span> at the pier on the eastern side of the harbour, but it has no water or electricity. Moor alongside or med-style using an anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Kuźnica</strong><br/>This old fishing harbour lies about 5nm further north of <span>Jastarnia</span> along the Hel Peninsula. It is a useful alternative destination when Jastarnia is crowded.</p>
<p>The approach channel is due to have channel markers this spring (2014) but is dredged and yachts with a draft of up to 2m can enter. The church tower makes a conspicuous landmark.</p>
<p>In this recently re-built harbour, there are toilets, electricity and water and the town also has good fish bars and some provisions.</p>
