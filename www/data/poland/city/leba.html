<div class="hello"><div><p>Warning - the entrance (161m wide) becomes difficult in winds from W through N to NE above Force 5.</p>
<p>There is an outbound current at the entrance, and the port itself of up to 2kn an influence from Lake Lebsko. The most frequent cross current is NE 2-3kn during strong westerly winds.</p>
<p>Approaches - although the approach to Leba is easy during the day as well as at night, during a sunny summers day, locating the actual entrance can be difficult (the sun's reflection on the water, the white sands, and the trees screening the port, cause the problem.) Locate the castle-like structure on the Hotel Neptune then look for the mole heads. </p>
<p>From the west - Lighthouse Czolpino Fl W 8s Mo(n) 75m 12M, round and built from red brick. Unfortunately it is obscured by trees leaving mainly the top black dome, housing the light visible.  Before the lighthouse you will see the sand dunes, 40-50m high, glistening in the sun.</p>
<p>From the East - Lighthouse Stilo (Fl(3)W 12s 75m 23M, red tower, black and white bands, mounted high up on the top of the dunes and clearly visible. Hotel Neptune (known as Georing's Palace) has the appearance of a castle with a single tower. Three grey, steel chimneys in town can be seen. The middle one is 40m tall. 4.5M east of Leba, close to shore, masts of a wreck Nord Star stick out of the water. A signal mast is situated 320m south of eastern head.</p>
