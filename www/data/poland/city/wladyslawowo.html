<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Not a very exciting town, but a useful stopping point with good shelter.</span></p>
<p>Warning - because of sand banks the whole area becomes dangerous in strong onshore winds. Entrance in wind Force 5 especially from N to E is dangerous. The depth in the area is continuously variable. Use of an echo sounder is strongly recomended.</p>
<p>Approaches - From the "WLA" buoy (RW Lfl.10s) steer course 260° from the leading marks (lit). No 1 marker is on the Eastern Mole (150m from its head) No 2 is the distictive, tall spire/tower of Dom Rybaka. Once you are in line with the Northern mole turn to port and continue in the middle of the approach channel. Entrance is 60m wide with minimum depth of 5m.</p>
<p>Mooring - the marina is located inside the fishing harbour. The Port is divided into 3 basins, outer inner and shipyard. Yachts moor up to Pontoons in the Western corner of the inner harbour or to the Northern harbour wall in the outer harbour.</p></div></div>
