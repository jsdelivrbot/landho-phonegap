<p>VHF (UKF) COMMUNICATION
Yachts should report on the VHF working channel before entering or leaving any port. This chnnel can also be a source of useful safety information.</p>
<p>Ch 16 is the calling channel for Search and Rescue and Ch 11 is the working channel for SAR.</p>
<p>Polish yachtsmen communicate on Ch 06 and Ch 10. (Ch 06 is most often used)
Fishermen use Ch 68, 69 and 77.</p>
<p>Ch 10 should not be used in the area of Wladyslawowo and Hel as it is the Port Control frequency.</p>
<p>Ch 06 should not be used in the Gdansk area where it is the channel used by the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Majority of Polish Ports work on Ch 12 with Gdansk on Ch 14.</p>
<p>Ch 71 should not be used as it is used by Port Control and others.</p>
<p>NAVTEX Transmissions from Gislovshamnar (Station J at 09:30 and 21:30 UTC) should normally be received on the Polish Coast.</p>

<p>Mobile Phones - A prepaid Poland SIM card with an international cell phone is the most convenient and economical solution. All incoming calls are FREE, regardless of where they originate. Pay the local rate for local calls and use a cellular phone in Poland like you do at home. Your Poland SIM Card (ERA) will require a SIM-unlocked GSM 900 / 1800 compatible international cell phone. </p>
