<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the main port of Ecuador, and lies on the west bank of Guayas river, about 40 miles inland. There are two ports, the old port and the new Puerto Nuevo, on the Estero Salado, which is a saltwater estuary lying parallel to the freshwater Guayas river. Both are navigable, although currents are strong. For a fee, the artificial canal, which has a depth of 9 feet at high water in parts of the entrance, can be used.</p>
