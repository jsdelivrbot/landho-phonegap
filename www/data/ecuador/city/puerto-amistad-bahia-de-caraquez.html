<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Amistad is located in Bahía de Caráquez, known locally as simply "Bahía" 36 nautical miles south of the Equator and 600 miles from Panama.</p>
<p>It is a very safe place to leave your boat while you travel inland <span>to popular sites such as Machu Picchu and Cuzco, Peru,</span> or return home. Because Bahía is located in a dry tropical zone, your boat will not suffer from the mold and mildew that is rampant in wet tropical locations such as Panama.</p>
<p><span><span>Bahía de Caráquez suffered </span>a devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake in April 2016, followed by at least two smaller quakes and an untold number of aftershocks. Rebuilding is underway however and the marina has re-opened with a new owner. (July 2016)</span></p>
<p>Position 00° 35' 24"S, 80° 25'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>An agent is not required here as Puerto Amistad is allowed to represent the yachts without actually being a ship's agent.</p>
<p><span>The new owner of the marina, <span>Gene Tatum, can arrange international clearance for a total cost of $180 (this covers everything, including a taxi). He can also arrange the extension to the initial 90 days permitted by Customs to allow the boat to remain in Ecuador for up to 1 year. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span><span>Contact him in advance on <strong><a href="mailto:tatum051@gmail.com" target="_blank">tatum051@gmail.com</a></strong></span></p>
<p>A visa is not required ahead of arrival. Likewise, a cruising permit is not needed to cruise the coast of Ecuador. On arrival the yacht will be inspected by the Navy.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour entrance is not buoyed, currents can be strong (there is an 8-10 foot tidal range here) and river shoals may not accord with published charts. It is advisable to time your arrival with high water morning for best conditions. <span> If you arrive or leave on an afternoon high water you will quite possibly be in for rough conditions on a shallow bar.</span></p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>All vessels require permission from the Capitania before entering and must also have a pilot on board. Call Puerto Amistad on channel 69 and they will arrange for one of their pilots to come out. The pilot will meet you in a launch at the ‘Waiting Room’ waypoint (00º 35.805S,080º26.832W) and come aboard and coach you into the anchorage (00º 36.400S,080º25.200W). The fee for pilots has been established by the Port Captain and you pay the Pilot directly ($35 in 2016). Note, the pilot boat will bear no responsibility for damage to your boat, so fender well!</p>
<p><strong>Be ready to move HW -1 hour. </strong> You do need a pilot.  The sandbanks move and there is no buoyage. If your chartplotter remembers a track then you can save yourself the pilot's fee for your departure.</p>
<p><span>If your landfall timing causes you to miss the high tide, one can anchor behind Cabo Posada 15 miles to the north of Bahia </span><span>(sand Bottom). Cabo Pasado is clear if you enter from the north or northwest. The reef runs WNW from the point and that breaks down the usual SW swell. It is not recommended to anchor at the "Waiting Room" point, as this is an open roadstead.</span></p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong></p>
<p>The moorings here are massive in construction weighing 5000 pounds each and have ship's hawsers for pennants. Very secure with 4 points (2 lines for the bow and 2 for the stern). The marina staff will help you with tying up. <span>Many people leave their boats here on mighty nose to tail moorings and travel. Your boat will be looked after. </span><span>See the web site for Puerto Amistad for more information </span><strong><a href="http://www.puertoamistad.com">www.puertoamistad.com/</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Currently there is a security guard that frequently patrols the boats that are moored at night.</strong></p>
<p>The town of "Bahia" is an easily walkable village, which has a fresh produce market and several smaller shops for provisioning. For more major shopping, Portoviejo is an hour away ($2) and Manta is 2 hours away ($3).</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><span><span>If there are no moorings available, you can anchor in good mud, but remember this is a river so the boat turns on every tide. Be sure to dig your anchor in well. The ebb with the river flow reaches 2.6 knots making the dinghy journey potentially dangerous. There is an efficient night security patrol with a searchlight. There is a charge to anchor here.</span></span></p>
<p>There is now a bridge across the estuary above Puerto Amistad which bars access beyond the moorings.</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>See the comment below for the new fees as from March 2016.</p>
