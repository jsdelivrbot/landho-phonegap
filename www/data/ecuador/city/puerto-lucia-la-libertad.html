<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a good place to leave a boat to travel overland, especially to Peru. If you are heading to the Galapagos from Panama, coming here first instead of going on the rhum line only adds 130 NM to the passage. There are excellent <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Ecuador/PuertoLucia?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyard and repair facilities</a></b> here.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Ecuador?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Ecuador Clearance</strong></a> for full details of clearance procedure.</p>
<p>All international vessels coming to Ecuador, by law, must have an Agent. The following agent represents cruisers at the present time: Julia Yturralde NOE SHIPPING (<span><a href="http://juliayde@hotmail.es/" target="_blank">juliayde@hotmail.es</a>)</span>. We recommend you request a quote in advance.</p>
<p><span>As you approach the port call the Port Captain on Ch 16.</span><span> </span><span>There is very little likelihood that you will get a response, but it is protocol to call.</span></p>
<p><span><span>As soon as the yacht is in radio range, the captain must report directly to Puerto Lucia Yacht Club on VHF Ch16 (08:00 to 18:00hrs) and follow instructions. Normally the yacht will be asked to anchor a short safe distance from the marina lighthouse on the starboard side past the entrance. If arriving outside working hours, the yacht must anchor outside the entrance buoy and clear in the following morning.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Agents charge each tourist boat approx. US$250, plus additional fees for immigration and customs etc., amounting to an average total cost of between US$300 - $400 for clearance. </span><span>Be sure to get a written quotation beforehand and ask the agent to write down every charge and itemize what it is for.</span><span> </span><span>Get an official Factura (receipt) for everything.</span></p>
<p>The Yacht Club and the agency will arrange for the Authorities to come on board the yacht, having helped with the preparation of the necessary documents. Initial permissions are 3 months for you and your boat.</p>
<p>The various fees to be paid, usually on departure, are collected by the Port Captain.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach<br/></strong><span>The peninsula here runs NW to SE and is built up all along its length. </span></p>
<p><span>The SE corner is called la Libertad and is a fishing village with many fishing boats anchored off.  Do not be tempted to anchor here! </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The NW end is called Salinas and, essentially, is a resort town and home to the exclusive Salinas Yacht Club. Bursting at its seams with 2,500 members, visitors are not able to berth here. However in August 2014 mooring buoys were installed off the yacht club that can be rented. </span></p>
<p><strong>Puerto Lucia</strong><br/>In the middle is Puerto Lucia, a private development of condos, gym, swimming pool, hotel, restaurant and marina with <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Ecuador/PuertoLucia?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyard</a> run by Stewart Yachts &amp; Services.</strong> The marina welcomes visitors and whilst everyone can normallly be accommodated, it is wise to book in advance. Puerto Lucia is easily identified by six apartment blocks, the one in the middle having a distinctive white roof in the shape of a pyramid.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Anchor at the entrance to the marina and call them on 19 Alpha.  If you do not have Alpha channels you will need to call them on your mobile phone - 278 3180.  One of the Marineros will come to fetch you in a dory. Do not be tempted to go alongside the fuel dock as it is frequently used by fishing boats to load supplies, fuel and bulk ice. Beware that remaining at anchoring in the entrance will incur the same charge as berthing in the marina.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The marina is not large and has floating pontoons with water and electricity on both its northern and southern sides. The north pontoons all have short fingers, the south pontoons are much cheaper for berthing but have three short fingers only. Mooring is Med-style. <span>There is surge in this marina (less on the cheaper south side) and so most boats put out long shore lines.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Security in the marina is excellent as there are guards on 24 hour duty, and there is strict control at the main gates that lead into the club and marina. All visitors must pre-resister at the marina office.</span></p>
<p>Noonsite has received a number of negative reports about this marina in the past which can be found adjacent under 'reports' and below under 'comments'. Topics include high costs, unreliable electricity &amp; Wifi and crude oil pollution in the harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Salinas</strong></p>
<p><span><span>There is excellent provisioning here and most services (including a large chandlery) can be found just a short taxi ride from the marina. </span></span></p>
