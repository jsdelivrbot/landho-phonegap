<p>Internet cafes can be found nearly everywhere in the major cities and in many of the smaller ones.<br/></p>
<p>For most visitors, the easiest place to make phone calls is an Internet cafe, most of which provide VOIP service at reasonable rates.<br>
Visitors making an extended stay should consider purchasing a cell phone. Most are sold on a prepaid-call basis, and phone refill cards can be purchased in all but the smallest towns. It is also possible to get a modern GSM cellular phone "unlocked" so that it will function in Ecuador. (you can take your own phone, if it is compatible with GSM 850MHz), however, this should be reserved for emergencies as the cost of actually making such a call is usually exorbitant.<br/></br></p>

<!--
19/01/12 SR Immigration: visa extension info from Mr Proano and confirmed by Tripp of Puerto Amistad. Tripp also going to check all of clearance to be sure we are accurate. 
19/01/12 SR Customs: extension info. provided by Puerto Amistad. 
19/01/12 SR Fees: arrivals tax info. clarified. Although this tax has been elminated in June last yr. I still think it's important to have it in there in case any agents try it on. Info. from Mr Proano and confirmed by Puerto Amistad. 25/01/12 SR on suggestion from Puerto Amistad, cleaned up clearance and moved info. on SITRAME and the Sail Plan to docs. as this is organised by the agent. 11/03/2013 SR Not sure I have it right, but added technical stop info. free of fees as emailed in Esp by Mr Proano. Waiting for him to confirm. 
15/05/2013 SR Anthony was never asked for an Autografo sailing from Ecuador to the Galapagos, just given the 20 days one port stay on arrival in the Galapagos. So have removed this info.
22/01/2014 VE Immigration, Customs and security checked/updated using UK FCO website.
13/03/2015 SR Had a note from a wild card saying an agent was no longer needed for Customs clearance. We contacted some agents, and Tripp, all who said it wasn't true. However, in contacting one agent, he mentioned the Arrivals tax of $310 which we thought was abolished in 2000. Trying to get to the bottom of it as might just be his port Salinas, but for now have put info. in itallics.
09/06/2015 CP checked Publications
21/01/2016 VE checked Customs & Immigration. Updated Security & links.
