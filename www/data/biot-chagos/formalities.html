<div><p><span><strong>FCO advice to yachts planning to visit Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory):</strong><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span>T</span>he British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is not a tourist destination. Applications from transiting yachts are checked carefully to ensure that a stop there is essential for their safe passage across the Indian Ocean. Where that is not the case, or there is any concern that the visit is not consistent with the policies and laws of the British Indian Ocean Territory (in particular its ambitious environmental objectives), a permit will not be granted.</p>
<p>Yachts wishing to visit BIOT must <strong>apply for a permit</strong> and Immigration Clearance in advance and the applicable fee is also payable in advance.</p>
<p>BIOT launched a new website in 2016 (<a href="http://biot.gov.io/" target="_blank"><strong>http://biot.gov.io/</strong></a>)  and all application documents can now be found online, along with detailed instructions on what to do.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://biot.gov.io/visiting/mooring-permits/">How to Apply for a Mooring Permit</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The maximum stay permitted is 28 days. BIOT Permits are paid for and approved by the week (7 day periods), not by the day. See<strong> <a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for details. <span>When applying for a permit, it may be wise to purchase a four week period which would give you greater flexibility for arrival and departure dates.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Please apply for a permit at least six weeks prior to your intended arrival date, as the application process can take several weeks. There is no right to receive a permit, and they are granted solely at the discretion of the Administration.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><span>As stated above, BIOT is not a tourist destination and access is restricted. Permits are </span><span>only issued to yachts on safe passage. On the application form where it requests ‘Purpose of Visit’ it </span><span>is IMPORTANT that you state <strong>“Transit”</strong>. In 2016 several yachts were declined permits due to the fact </span><span>they stated “Tourism”, “Private visit”, “Pleasure” or other similar wording as their purpose of visit.</span></p>
<p><span>Note, you will need to send a copy of your insurance documents with your permit application (see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></strong><span> for details of insurance required for BIOT).</span></p>
<p><span>Send application by e-mail or fax:<br/><span>E-mail: BIOTAdmin@fco.gov.uk <br/>Fax: 020 7008 1589</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Note:</strong> E-mail attachments must be <strong>5.0 Mb</strong> or smaller, which might mean you have to send several e-mails. <span>Your e-mails or fax cover sheets must have your vessel name in the subject field.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span>Payment is due once your application has been approved by the Administration. Payment details will be sent to you on approval and are by bank transfer only in British Pounds (see <a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a>).</span></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Visiting yachts may be permitted only to anchor in <strong><a class="external-link" href="PerosBanhos">Peros Banhos</a></strong> and the <strong><a class="external-link" href="SalomonIslands">Salomon Islands</a></strong> at the approved sites. Access to <strong><a class="external-link" href="DiegoGarcia">Diego Garcia</a></strong> in BIOT, is only permitted to those with connections to those <span>on pre-authorised official duty.</span></p>
<p>You are subject to BIOT law when inside its territorial waters. If you break any of these laws, you will become subject, as in any country, to a range of censures and punishments, including fines, imprisonment, deportation, or the impounding <span>and forfeiture</span> of your vessel.</p>
<p>You should be aware that any person who enters BIOT without permission may be liable to imprisonment for 3 years and/or a fine of £10,000 <span>and the vessel used to enter BIOT waters may be seized and forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Arrival Clearance Procedure</strong></span></p>
<p align="LEFT">The BIOT Patrol Vessel may visit your yacht after you arrive. <span>Their RIB will pull along side your yacht and two men will board your boat, a Customs official and the Visit Vessel Control Officer (VVCO). The rib will not tie off to your vessel, but expect black boot marks. Hand the Customs official your passports and a printed copy of your Chagos Vessel Mooring Permit, and related exception e-mails (if any).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT">After reviewing the documents to make sure they are valid for the time period of your visit, Customs will stamp the passports and the permit with a BIOT Customs Arrival stamp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are no clearing-out procedures, unless the BIOT Patrol Boat just happens to be in the atoll on the day you depart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">No clearance document for your next port is provided, and the BIOT Authorities do not expect to see your last port of clearance document.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p><span>BIOTA is committed to preserving the rich environmental heritage of the British Indian Ocean Territory. Marine protected areas are recognised by scientists and the international community as essential to the conservation and sustainable management of oceans and fisheries. BIOT hosts the world’s largest contiguous ‘no take’ marine reserve, along with several strict nature reserves.</span></p>
<p>If you are granted permission, you must moor your vessel at the <strong>BIOT approved sites</strong> only, to help conserve BIOT’s fragile coral environment. If your vessel is not moored at one of the approved sites, you are liable to be issued with an on-the-spot fine of £500. Failure to pay the fine could result, on conviction, to imprisonment not exceeding 6 months and/or a fine not exceeding £3,000.</p>
<p>Any person entering the Strict Nature Reserves of Great Chagos Bank (The Three Brothers and Resurgent Island; Danger Island; Cow Island; Nelson Island) and Peros Banhos Atoll (all the islands to the east of a line drawn between the easternmost point of land on Moresby Island and the easternmost point of land on Fouquet Island - in practice, this means that one may only anchor off the western islands which is quite unsafe during the SE trade wind season), is liable to an on-the-spot fine of £1000. Failure to pay the fine could result, on conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and/or to a fine not exceeding £5000, and to detention and forfeiture of any boat and equipment used when committing the offence.</p>
<p><span>The Strict Nature Reserves also include the territorial seas around each of the named islands, and therefore transit within 3 nautical miles of the islands is prohibited, as is any water-based activity, e.g. fishing.</span></p>
<p>The islands are a conservation area and all flora and fauna, such as turtles, coconut crabs, live coral and shells, are protected.</p>
<p><span>The heart of a palm should not be taken. </span></p>
<p><span>Possession of spearfishing equipment is strictly prohibited, but a permit may be granted for the possession of scuba diving gear. </span></p>
<p><span>The policy of the BIOT Marine Protected Area is for no fishing. An exception to this is to allow cruisers to fish for their own consumption (no more than three day’s worth) with a hand line only. BIOTA require all visiting yachts to complete a fishing log (a blank log will be sent out with the permit), which should be kept up to date during your visit as a Fisheries Protection Officer may wish to see it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Penalties for infringement of the regulations are severe.</span></span></p>
<p>Any person who enters BIOT without permission is liable to imprisonment for 3 years and/or a fine of £10,000 and the vessel used to enter BIOT waters may be seized and forfeited.</p>
