<div class="hello"><div><p><span>BIOT is governed by a Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Administrator based in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. The Commissioner’s representative in Diego Garcia is a Royal Navy Commander, who combines this role with his military duties as Commander British Forces. </span></p>
<p>Diego Garcia may only be entered in a serious emergency. Yachts trying to enter will be stopped outside the main pass and searched by the Navy.</p>
<p>If an emergency stop is considered necessary, it is best to contact the authorities on VHF Channel 16 or <span>2.182MHz HF SSB</span>, while approaching the island, and advise them of the nature of the emergency. In the past the authorities have done their best to render assistance to yachts with genuine problems.</p>
<p>BIOTA says, "<span>Unauthorised vessels or persons are not permitted to access this island. Vessels in transit, on “innocent passage” as defined under Maritime Law, are not permitted to enter the internal waters of Diego Garcia.”</span></p>
