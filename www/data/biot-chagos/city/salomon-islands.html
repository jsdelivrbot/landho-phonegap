<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Salomon Islands offer the best all-round protection in the archipelago. Several boats were anchored there in safety when a tropical cyclone passed close by in May 1993, producing winds of up to 50 knots. Although fully fledged cyclones are not known to have passed over the archipelago directly, this incident served as a timely warning that even areas that are considered to be lying outside the known cyclone area should be treated with great caution during the cyclone season.</span></p>
<p>The boats anchored at Salomon normally monitor VHF channel 69.</p>

<p>W (Diable) 5 deg S 21.05 / 72 deg E 12.51</p>
<p>E (Poule) 5 deg S 21.45 / 72 deg E 13.17</p>
<p><strong>Salomon, Ile Fouquet / Takamaka</strong></p>
<p>Southeast of a line from mid Takamaka to the SE tip of Fouquet.</p>
<p>N (Takamaka) 5 deg S 19.73 / 72 deg E 15.94</p>
<p>S (Fouquet) 5 deg S 20.64 / 72 deg E 15.40</p>
<p>When anchoring off Takamaka/Fouquet, always keep in mind that sudden violent squalls from the NW can occur anytime. See "Warning about Salomon Atoll" adjacent for further details.</p>
<p>There are wells on both Takamaka and Boddam Islands. The water can be used for laundry, but it must be treated or boiled if used for drinking. <span>BIOTA do not advise the use of the wells.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>All rubbish must be removed and taken with you. There are no facilities to dispose of rubbish on the islands and rubbish must not be burnt.</span></p>
<p>The coral patches and reefs in the approaches to the ruined dock at Boddam (next to a large cross) have been marked with white buoys. Because of many isolated coral patches throughout Salomon atoll, the lagoon should be crossed only in good visibility.</p>
