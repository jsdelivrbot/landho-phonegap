<div class="hello"><div><p>The Egmont Islands are not a permitted anchoring site in BIOT for visiting yachts, however in case of genuine emergency details are as follows:-</p>
<p>The lagoon can be entered on its north-west side through an area where the reef is submerged. This should only be negotiated in good light and as the only anchorage is to the south-east, a mid or late morning arrival is recommended.</p>
<p>The pass is not easily identified and its GPS coordinates have been reported (2004) at 6 deg 38.391 S, 71 deg 20.916 E. A minimum depth of 4 metres has been reported at these coordinates.</p>
<p>Care should be taken when navigating in the lagoon as there are many isolated coral heads. There is an anchorage in 6 metres in the south-east corner by Sudest Island, but it is not protected from the north-west. The swell tends to roll in at high tide making the anchorage quite rolly.</p>
