<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months on entry. All froeigners must have a visa.</p>
<p>Visas are difficult to obtain as tourism is not encouraged. Anyone travelling to Saudi Arabia can only obtain a visa by either being sponsored by a local company or having a written invitation from an influential individual. Even so, visas are extremely rarely granted to sailors.</p>
<p>In genuine emergencies, yachts have been allowed to stop for a few days in one of the major ports, but the crew's movements were restricted to the immediate port area.</p>
<p>Entry visas are not normally issued to holders of Israeli passports, passports which have been stamped with Israeli visas, or if there is some proof that one has been or intends to go to Israel.</p>
<p>Length of permitted stay <strong>must not</strong> be confused with the validity of the visa and clarification should be sort on entry. There are heavy fines and imprisionment for overstaying.</p>

<div><p><span>The norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative, and religious police, known as Mutawwa, are charged with enforcing these standards. Mutawwa are required to carry special identification and usually are accompanied by uniformed police; however, in some cases they have detained persons even without police presence. To ensure that conservative standards of conduct are observed, the Saudi religious police have accosted or arrested foreigners for improper dress or other alleged infractions, such as consumption of alcohol or association by a female with a male to whom she is not related.</span></p></div>
