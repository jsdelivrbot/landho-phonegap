<div><ul>
<li>One of the smaller South American countries, Uruguay has little coastline on the Atlantic. Besides Punta del Este and a few resorts in the vicinity, Uruguay holds little attraction for cruising yachts. There are more interesting things to see in the interior of this low, undulating country, which is the land of the gaucho.</li>
<li>Uruguay is however a good alternative to Argentina if coming from the Falklands. There are some adequate repair facilities, Piriapolis in particular comes recommended by cruisers.</li>
<li>The best facilities are at Punta del Este, Uruguay's main seaside resort and yachting centre, which has a marina and travelift. Piriapolis, a protected harbour to the West, has good new facilities, including a travelift, with several recommended yacht repair companies. The small port of Buceo close to the capital Montevideo has a yacht club with moorings available to visitors. The old city of Colonia has a good marina.</li>
