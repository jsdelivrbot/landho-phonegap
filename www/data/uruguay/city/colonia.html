<div class="hello"><div><p>Immigration and Customs is very easy and hassle free if clearing in at
Colonia. </p>
<p>The Prefectura office is locatede next to the Buquebus terminal,
about a 10-minute walk from Colonia yacht harbour. The friendly officials
will process your paperwork for free in about 10 minutes, and your boat
will then have 9 months to enjoy in Uruguay. </p>
<p>No other offices need to be visited. </p>
<p>When exiting the country, get a note from the marina showing your
bills have been paid, and return to the same office, who will issue your
Zarpe. The attitude everywhere is very welcoming and friendly.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Uruguay_Coloniaview.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/>The harbour here is relatively shallow. The whole delta, apart from the dredged channels, is shallow, rarely more than 4M.</p>
<p>The harbour has med-moorings with buoys along the rock wall jetty, and the wood pier have just been rebuilt with more of the same, for boats up to 50 feet.</p>
<p>All buoys in the harbour were replaced in early 2012.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/Uruguay_Coloniadocking.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/>Electricity (220v) and water is available at each mooring on the jetty and the wood pier. There are also mooring balls (borneos) available, which cost half the price (e.g. 16m yacht for 2 months is US$575).</p>
<p>Water taxi is available on VHF 21, and costs Uruguay 35 pesos round trip, which is less than US$2.</p>
<p>The marina is very safe, and many foreign yachts are left there for extended periods unattended, even more so now that Argentina is less friendly to cruisers.</p>
