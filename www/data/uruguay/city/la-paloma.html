<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Uruguay_PortPaloma_docking_sizeforsite.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina has a length of 70 meters and is 40 meters wide at its end. Yachts moor "Med style" on its northern side, while the southern part is mostly used for small fishing boats – and at times a place is found for a yacht. <span>Yachts may also be moored to buoys off the pier. </span></p>
<p><span>The marina has good connections for fresh water and 220 V.a.c.</span></p>
<p><span>The depth alongside varies from 1.50 meters to 4.50 meters (at “0” datum) depending on the mooring position.</span></p>
<p><span>Minor repairs are possible here. There are two clinics for medical and dental assistance, while major hospitals are located in Rocha (the Department capital) 25 km away. There are several daily bus connections to Montevideo (250 km).</span></p>
