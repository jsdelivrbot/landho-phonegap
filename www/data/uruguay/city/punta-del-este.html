<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Everyone is very welcoming in Puntal del Este and English is spoken in the Marina office as well as at the yacht club.  Cruisers have reported to feel safe here. During the low season the cost of berthing is greatly reduced from the December to February season, when the population expands ten fold or more, as does the local yachting activity.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Officials do not board yachts for clearance. <span>Formalities are carried out in the marina complex and include Aduana (Customs) and Prefectura (Coast Guard).</span></p>
<p>Immigration is now handled at the Capitán de Corbeta Carlos A. Curbelo International Airport, located near Laguna del Sauce on the outskirts of the city. First you will need to visit the Prefectura, followed by a bus to the airport for immigration, then Customs and finally Prefectura again back at the marina.</p>
<p>You will be required to show that you have paid the marina before you can be cleared out by the Prefectura.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Uruguay_P.Este_Stephan_sized.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The only place to stay in a marina in Punta Del Este is at the Municipal Marina. There are two yacht clubs also, however these are for members only. The Yacht Club Punta Del Este is located on the same grounds as the marina complex, which also has all the Uruguayan Authorities offices<i> (see the <span>Customs and Coast Guard building on the right of the picture with the Punta del Este lighthouse on the left)</span></i>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of moorings, some are free and others can be hired for a daily fee which includes a launch service; however, you may well be required to take and pay for a berth in the marina. Note that you must show that you have paid the marina before you can be cleared by the Prefectura (Uruguay Coast Guard).</p>
