            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a Port of Entry. See <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Uruguay?rc=Formalities">Uruguay Formalities</a></b> for full details on clearing into and out of the country.</p>
<p><span>Call PUNTA DEL ESTE CONTROL </span><span>on VHF channel 16 at least 30 minutes before arrival.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The marina staff will gladly assist with line handling. Tie up in a marina berth as directed and handle the formalities later.</span></span></p>
<p>Next be sure to change some money as the rest of the Clearance process needs small amounts of local currency (<span>Uruguayan pesos)</span><span>. You will need to visit:</span></p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong><br/><span>The immigration office is located 50 meters from the port, and operates Monday to Saturday from 12:30h to 16:30h. </span><span>You will be stamped into the country and be given immigration papers.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Prefectura (Coastguard)</strong><br/><span>400 mtrs. to the North at the round-about</span> </span></p>
<p>Note: Every time you are issued a document/form, be sure to photocopy it 3 times.</p>
<p>You may want to keep your vessel in the country indefinitely, but there is a recurring fee every 9 months based on the tonnage of the vessel (e.g. U$750 for a 16 ton yacht). If you leave Uruguay inside the 9 months, there is no fee.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Uruguay_PortPiriapolis2_Stephan.JPG/@@images/image/preview"/>Visitors are offered stern-to berths in this well-protected harbour <i>(photo by Stephan <span>Nedelchev) </span></i>which has recently been expanded offering 100 new moorings. There is water, electricity and showers, all of which are charged for.</p>
<p>This is reported to be a popular place to take the boat up on the hard. There are few restrictions on doing work on the boat, and you are also free to  travel leaving the boat behind. The place is known to be windy, so care  should be taken to secure the boat.</p>
