<div class="hello"><div><p>Being the capital city of Uruguay, this is a busy and important port.  It lies on the northern shore of the River Platte estuary which is, at this point, some 50nm wide.</p>
<p>It is a popular cruise ship destination having beautiful colonial buildings and attractive beaches.</p>
<p>Position 34° 54.2'S, 56° 12.2'W</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../Uruguay_P.Buceo_docking_sized.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/>There are no yachting facilities in the commercial harbour, but both marina berths and other moorings are available at Puerto del Buceo harbour, approximately 9nm to the East<i> (see photo left)</i>.</p>
<p>Local rules are that you must notify the authorities half an hour before your arrival at Puerto del Buceo on VHF Ch. 16 (Puerto Buceo Control - coastguard station).</p>
<p><strong>Santa Lucia: Santiago Vazquez</strong><br/>Another option is at Santiago Vazquez on the Santa Lucía river, about 20nm to the west. Here there is a marina and a yacht club, however since the construction of a new bridge with high voltage power lines it is only recommended for small cruising boats<i> (see photo right)</i>.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../copy_of_Uruguay_Montevideo_YCUdocks.JPG/@@images/image/mini"/>In the middle of the river the wires are recorded as being at 11 meters, and at the sides 16 meters above mean water level, but take care: with a strong wind from the southeast the river rises up to 2 meters.</p>
<p><span>Before heading to Santa Lucia it is recomended to call Santiago Vazquez control, the local costguard station. <span>A 32 ft German yacht touched the power lines here in February 2013 and burnt to the waterline within minutes, so care should be taken to contact the authorities before attempting this trip.</span></span></p>
