<div><p>Before entering any port, call the "Control Maritimo" on VHF Channel 16 (try 9 or 11 if no reply). There may be a delay if an English-speaking operator seems to be required.</p>
<p>You should then state your position and destination. On entering the port, first visit the Coast Guard office (Prefectura Naval). They may deal with all the entry requirements, or they may send you to the Customs and Immigration offices.</p>
<p>Formalities are important in Uruguay and many copies of the necessary documents will be useful, including a "Safety Certificate". The fact that many countries do not issue such a document is not easily understood. A little forward planning might help with this.</p>
<p>On departure, a letter from the Hidrografia office confirming that all fees have been paid will be required. Be sure to ask for a formal zarpe on exit as cruisers entering Panama from Uruguay have been fined for not having the proper papers.</p>
