<div><p><span>The port authority should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 for instructions on arrival.</span></p>
<p>Customs &amp; Immigration offices are open 08:00-12:30, 14:00-17:00 Monday to Friday. Customs will require a copy of the Ship's papers, as well as a payment of 5,000 CFA (US$12).</p>
<p><span>Immigration will hold either the ships papers or a copy of the same, give you a receipt, stamp your passport and then most likely enquire if you feel like giving them a "gift" - as a charge. This should be politely refused - it does not cause any problems.</span></p>
<p>On clearing out it is only necessary to visit Immigration who will stamp the passports and then return the ships papers in return for the receipt (they will even return the copy).</p>
<p>No clearance document of any kind is available which should be taken into account if leaving for a port which needs one.</p>

<p><strong>From May 2015: </strong>Most visitors do not need a visa prior to a visit of up to 3 months.</p>
<p><span>Biometric visas are not now a requirement. Your passport can just be marked with an entry stamp.</span></p>
<p>If you do have apply for a biometric visa, (obtained through <strong><a href="http://www.snedai.sn/paiement">www.snedai.sn/paiement</a>),</strong> the two emails received will need to be produced at your Port of Entry, where they should be able to issue your biometric visa. However, it has been reported that many road border crossings do not have the necessary equipment.</p>
<p><span>They can be obtained at Dakar airport and may also be issued by French embassies, but </span><span>honorary consulates are unable issue them.</span></p>
