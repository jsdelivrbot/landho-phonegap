<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Dakar</strong> is the capital and largest city of Senegal, as well as being the westernmost city on the African mainland.</p>
<p>Baie de Han, where visiting yachts are berthed, is very polluted. Be sure to wash your hands when you have touched the water or a wet line and do not swim around the boat. Mosquitos can be a problem here and cruisers recommend using DEET spray and Malarone. Several Malaria cases have been reported at the <span>Cercle de Voile de Dakar (CVD)</span>.</p>
<p><span>There are three uncharted wrecks (</span><i>epaves</i><span>) situated in the approach to the yacht-club (CVD), positions are given on the CVD website and are as follows:</span></p>
<div>Epave 1: 14°42' 731N 17° 25' 324W</div>
<div>Epave 2: 14° 42' 778N 17° 25' 615W</div>
<div>Epave 3: 14° 42' 754N 17° 25' 717W</div></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The port authority should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 for instructions.  All Yachts are directed to the Baie de Han anchorage (pass south and then east of Gorée Island before proceeding 2.7 miles NNE into the recommended anchorage NW of Pointe de Bel-Air).</p>
<p>The yacht club Cercle de Voile de Dakar(CVD) is nearby and is very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Customs &amp; Immigration:</strong><br/> Take a taxi as it is a long walk between the two. The club will give you directions. Offices are open 08:00-12:30, 14:00-17:00 Monday to Friday (although this tends to be flexible so be patient).</p>
<p>Customs require a payment of 5,000 CFA (US$12). Immigration will want a copy of the ships papers. You may be asked to provide a "gift" - as a customs charge. This should be politely refused - it does not cause any problems.</p>
<p>On clearing out it is only necessary to visit Immigration who will stamp the passports.</p>
<p>No clearance document of any kind is available which should be taken into account if leaving for a port which needs one.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>All Yachts are directed to the Baie de Han anchorage (see cautionary notes above). Here there are two yacht clubs, and it is more or less mandatory to use their services. The anchorage is somewhat roly - particularly with SW winds as the swell is refracted round the headland and ends up at right angles to the wind.</p>

      Club CVD has a charge by the day, week or month. This includes the Club water taxi (which run frequent trips all day), also water from the club - take your own filter.<br> There are also moorings at an extra charge. Boats can be hauled out and there are good repair services at very reasonable prices. Also a sailmaker. Their website, in French, is very useful.
