<div class="hello"><div><p>This port lies 33 miles up the Casamance river. There is a depth of 15 ft (5 m) over the bar at the river entrance, after which the minimum depth in the navigable channel is 30 ft (9 m). The middle channel is marked by buoys, but the river should only be navigated in daylight. Yachts can come alongside a wharf in the main port, which is on the southern bank of the river.</p>
