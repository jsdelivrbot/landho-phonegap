<p>Yachts must not stop anywhere before a port of entry, or they risk being fined. Valletta Port Control must be contacted on VHF Channels 12 or 16 (24 hour watch) before entering the harbour.</p>
<p>Make every effort to arrive (and leave) during office hours so that clearance can be completed at the <span>Immigration Police and Customs office, located at the root of the D pontoon at <span>Msida Marina. You may experience difficulties getting your passport stamped at the Cruise Ship Terminal (which is the out of hours location for clearance).</span></span></p>
<p>During office hours, visitors are normally directed to the reception dock in Msida Marina. Outside office hours clearance is done in the commercial port, Grand Harbour. There is no provision for yachts here, and anchoring near the Customs office can be difficult. Yachtsmen are strongly advised to time their arrival to enable them to clear inward at Msida Marina.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to enter Marsamxett harbour at night.</p>
<p>Outward clearance is also obtained from the Customs and Immigration offices, Msida Creek. It is possible to clear out on any day provided the boat is leaving before 08:00 the following morning. Outside of office hours, go to the Customs House in Valletta. A receipt for the payment of berthing fees must be obtained first in order to clear out. Customs will require a crew list. It is possible to clear out on a Friday if leaving the following Sunday.</p>
<p>Duty-free stores can be obtained before departure - they will be loaded under the supervision of a Customs officer, and will be sealed until departure from Maltese waters. After loading duty-free goods, the yacht must leave within 24 hours.</p>

<div><p>All visitors should have a valid passport.</p>
<p>Malta is a member of the Schengen Agreement Area. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/General/EuropeanUnion"><strong>Noonsite' Schengen page</strong> </a> for more details on the immigration rules.</p>
<p>Visas are obtainable from Maltese or British diplomatic missions abroad. Nationals from countries needing a visa may be granted one on arrival, especially if staying only a short time.</p>
<p>Immigration officials at the Cruise ship terminal do not (or even will not) stamp the passports of persons arriving by sea. If leaving by air, it is necessary to notify the port police, who will stamp passports.</p>
<p>It is advised that non-EU citizens go to the Immigration office at <span>Msida Marina, Marsamxett Harbour to get their passports stamped.</span></p>

<div><p>There are no restrictions on cruising around the archipelago, but Valletta Port Control must be kept informed on VHF Channel 12 of the movement of the yacht while away from the marina.</p>
<p>Spearfishing without a licence is strictly forbidden, and the penalty is a heavy fine. Diving is prohibited in some areas and these are listed on the permit. Any archaeological finds must be reported.</p>
<p>Yachts should note that the correct courtesy flag for Malta is the country flag (as depicted on all Noonsite Malta pages) and NOT the Maltese Merchant Ensign (white Maltese Cross on a red field bordered by white) which is only to be flown by Maltese-registered vessels.</p>
