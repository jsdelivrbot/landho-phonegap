<div class="hello"><div><p>Malta has been blessed by nature with one of the best natural harbours in the Mediterranean and the decline of its traditional role as a Navy base and shipping centre has led to the development of its yachting facilities, which are already among the best in the region.</p>
<p>Marsamxett Harbour is on the northern side of the peninsula on which sits the city of Valletta, the other side of which is <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/Malta/GrandHarbour">Grand Harbour</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>All arriving yachts should call Malta Port Authority before entering the harbour. This is a formality and a safety issue as there is alot of traffic going in and out of the harbours.</span></p>
<p>On arrival all yachts arriving from non-EU waters have to report at the Customs Office, Grand Harbour or via the Msida Marina (<b><a class="external-link" href="http://marinamalta.com/marina-general-information/">see map</a></b>). Go<span> to visit them with passports and boat papers after you have berthed or anchored. Everyone is supposed to visit them, but if you are from outside the EU it is more important.</span></p>
<p>The Immigration Police office is in a building on the South side of the Marina.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>All arriving yachts should call Malta Port Authority before entering the harbour. This is a formality and a safety issue as there is alot of traffic going in and out of the harbours.</span></p>
<p>The main marine facilities are in the creeks leading off Marsamxett harbour. A breakwater at the opening of Msida Creek has increased the protection of the Msida and Ta’ Xbiex Marina.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/malta-pics/MsidaMarina_Malta.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/></p>
<p>Visitors moor to the inside of the Breakwater at <span> Msida and Ta’ Xbiex Marina. Photo ©<a href="http://marinamalta.com/">http://marinamalta.com/</a></span></p>
<p>Lazaretto Creek has stern-to moorings on either side (Lazaretto and Ta'Xbiex quays) and these are used mainly by larger yachts. It is very exposed to the swell caused by the "gregale", a north easterly wind, and yachts should not be left unattended here when it is blowing.</p>
<p>No visiting yachtsman should tie up to any of the large yellow mooring buoys in Sliema Creek; these are private buoys, not available for general use.</p>
<p>The <strong>Msida and Ta’ Xbiex Marina</strong> is now privately run, and much better organised with improved facilities.Berths can be booked in advance (see their listing below for details). The busiest period is during September/October when visitors arrive for a winter stay, and local yachts have not yet been hauled out. By November, there is usually space available for boats wishing to over-winter here.</p>

<p>Though the <span>Msida and Ta’ Xbiex Marina</span> can be crowded, the newer <a href="Countries/Malta/Gzira"><strong>Manoel Island Marina</strong></a> usually has more space available.</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong><span> Two jetties have been laid by the RMYC at the entrance to the Msida and Ta’ Xbiex Marina, which are neither in NAVIONICS charts nor in the IMRAY guides. When you approach the entrance to the marina during night - be careful.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Space for anchoring is very limited, but it might be possible to do so off the Manoel Island Slips &amp; Haulout Facility (NOT Manoel Island Marina).</p>
<p>Another place is in front of the Royal Malta Yacht Club in 30 ft over mud. This is conveniently close to many services.</p>
