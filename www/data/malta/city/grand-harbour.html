<div class="hello"><div><p>The Customs House is on Lascaris Wharf at the cruise liner terminal in Grand Harbour - just below the bus terminal. It is possible to come alongside, but it is better for yachts to clear in at Manoel Island, Sliema. Call Valetta Radio and go ashore at Lazartte Creek &amp; report to Customs, Immigration, Police and Harbour Office.</p>
<p>At present, all vessels still need to obtain exit clearance - including
providing proof of payment of all marina fees. Before final departure from the Islands, a passenger/crew list has to be drawn up on the appropriate form and presented to Customs Officer and all passports are to be submitted to the Immigration Officer. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Grand Harbour Marina (completed 2010) is reported as being one of the best in Malta, although it is not cheap (cost for a 12m yacht in 2013 was around €945.00/month). Very secure.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Kalkara Marina is probably the cheapest in the Grand Harbour and it's also a boatyard, so you can easily fix any kind of problem.</span></span></p>
<p>There is very little room to anchor here, the only possibility being in Rinella Creek.</p>
