<div class="hello"><div><p>The island of Gozo is a third of the size of the main island of Malta, but greener and more rural. It is made up of hills and deep valleys, as well as rugged cliffs. The sheltered marina is a useful base for exploring the smaller islands. </p>
<p>Mgarr lies on the southern shore and is the main ferry port for the island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Since October 2008 it is now possible to clear in at Mgarr Marina all year round. The Customs office is in the same building as the marina office and is open 0800-1700 daily, extended until 2000 from 1st June to 30th September. Visiting yachts should approach Pontoon F - berthing assistants will indicate location of the Customs Office on arrival.</p>
<p>Cruisers reccommend Mgarr as a clearing-in port as the procedure here is very straightforward and much less complicated than trying to clear in elsewhere.</p>
<p>At present, all vessels still need to obtain exit clearance - including
providing proof of payment of all marina fees. Before final departure from the Islands, a passenger/crew list has to be drawn up on the appropriate form and presented to Customs Officer and all passports are to be submitted to the Immigration Officer. There tends to be a more relaxed attitude here than at Valletta.</p>
