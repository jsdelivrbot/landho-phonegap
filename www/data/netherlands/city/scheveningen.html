<div class="hello"><div><p>Scheveningen is a popular tourist destination with an impressive sandy beach.</p>
<p>It is also is a busy fishing harbour with a lot of commercial traffic, therefore rules must be carefully followed when piloting in the harbour.</p>
<p>Early 2016 the marina "Jachtclub Scheveningen" and Schevenigen Traffic Centre (STC) agreed a number of rules which yachts must follow on entering this harbour. See the Clearance section below and the comment at the bottom of the page for full details.</p>
<p>Scheveningen harbour does not give access to the inland waterway system of The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Position <span>57°07’7N, 004°14’1E. (fairway buoy)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Contact <span> Schevenigen Traffic Centre (STC) for permission to either enter or exit this harbour. Keep in constant contact with STC on VHF channel 21.</span></p>
<p>This harbour must always be traversed with the engine running, even if under sail and advise STC of your actions if planning to raise or lower your sails in the outer harbour.</p>
<p>Take note of the following harbour control lights:-</p>
<p>Red above White: Entrance forbidden</p>
<p>White Above Red: Exit forbidden</p>
<p>When leaving the marina/inner harbour through “De Pijp” a r<span>ed light on starboard side</span> means exiting through the channel (<span>“De Pijp”</span>) into the outer harbour is forbidden due to traffic movements inside the port.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care in strong on-shore winds as the entrance can be dangerous. Entering at slack water avoids the strong currents around the breakwaters.</p>
<p><span>It is permitted to raise or lower sails in the outer harbour with the agreement of Traffic Control. If there is heavy traffic movements, this may not be permitted and you may have to either wait in the marina or outside the harbour.</span></p>
<p>Once through the narrow passage (<span>de Pijp</span>) from the inner harbour (<span>Tweede Haven), the marina is to sta'bd.</span></p>
<p><span>When the Harbour Master is gone after 17:00, register at the clubhouse “Het Spuigat” in the South-West side of the marina.</span></p>
