<div class="hello"><div><p>Amsterdam is a busy and important city  and is reached from the North Sea by the 15 mile long North Sea Canal, or through the lock at the southern end of the Ijsselmeer.</p>
<p>At the seaward entrance of the North Sea Canal lies Ijmuiden with its large marina.</p>
Position 52°22′23″N, 4°53′32″E.</div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If wishing to cross the city to/from southern Holland without lowering your mast, the it is necessary to use the <span>Staande Mast route (<span>Standing Mast Route: PDF downloadable from </span><a href="http://www.varendoejesamen.nl/?language=en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.varendoejesamen.nl/?language=en</strong></a>).</span></p>
<p><strong>Approaching from the North</strong><br/> It is only possible to cross the city using this route once per day, between around midnight to 02.00 a.m. All the bridges will then be raised. Occasionally there can be up to a hundred  boats or more in this convoy. The transit through the 11 bridges and a lock takes about 2 hours.</p>
<p>It is necessary to report your participation to the lock keeper at the <span>Singelgrachtbrug bridge on VHF channel 22 before 11pm. The opening of the bridge is announced on VHF channel 69.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is plenty of room alongside the canal between Singelgrachtbrug and the railway bridge for mooring and waiting for the convoy to leave.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Approaching from the South</strong><br/> Entering the city from the south, this convoy takes place at around 23.30. p.m. Report to the <span> Nieuwe Meer lock keeper on VHF channel 22.</span></p>
<p>A useful report on this transit is on the blog from <strong><a href="http://www.suwena.net/en/node/430">S/v Suwena</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orangesluizen</strong> <strong>Locks</strong><br/> <span>This lock controls access to the Ijsselmeer.</span><br/>VHF Channel 18<br/> Opening hours: 24hrs<br/> Use the North lock, marked 'SPORT'. There are waiting piers either side.</p>
<p><strong>Schellingwoude Bridge </strong>(height 9m) <br/><span>This bridge also allows access to the city from the IJsselmeer.</span><br/>VHF Channel 18 <br/>Opens on the hour and +/- 20 mins. <br/>EXCEPT 06:00-09:00 and 16:00-18:00 Mondays to Fridays.</p>

<p><strong>Gouda<br/></strong><span>This is probably the most popular stopping place along the Staande   Mast Route. There is a marina in Gouda, but its surroundings are rather industrial. Also, the water level is very shallow. With a draft over 1.80m you can expect the keel to drag through some mud.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>A much better option is to pass the marina and continue towards the centre of Gouda. Pass the bridge, then the lock and then another bridge. After the last bridge turn right and there is plenty of space on both sides of the canal for mooring. The whole procedure should not take more than 30 minutes. The location is more idyllic and closer to city centre. Electricity is available on the piers. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The lock to Gouda might be closed on Sundays and if you cannot reach the city, or are planning to continue on Sunday, it is better to stay at the waiting pontoon at the lock. The opening times are posted on a sign at the lock entrance.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><img class="image-left" src="Countries/holland-pics/holland_amsterdam-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>Amsterdam Marinas</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The port basins in the western port area are not accessible to pleasure vessels, however the Amsterdam port and surrounding area offers a number of possibilities for visiting yachts.</span></p>
<p><span>The mooring situation in Amsterdam was pretty poor before the opening of the new Amsterdam marina, with all the mooring options always completely full and the marina at </span><span>Sixhaven</span><span> not able to accommodate yachts larger than 15m. </span></p>
<p><span>The new Amsterdam Marina is much roomier than the others with good facilities. It is a 15 minute free ferry ride from the city centre.</span></p>
