<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several mooring options in or very near Veere.</p>
<p>It is possible to berth in the canal itself, near the northern entrance. Here yachts lie alongside the staging on the northern bank. This is a cool, quiet spot in the summer. </p>
<p>The Stadshaven basin is a picturesque harbour right in the centre of Veere, where space is invariably found for new arrivals.</p>
<p>Oostwatering Jachthaven is just 3/4 mile north west of Veere harbour entrance. It is a good place for repairs.</p>
<p>Kamperland Jachthaven is a mile north east of Veere, on the northern shore of Veerse Meer.</p>
<p>The Delta marina is on the northern bank of Veerse Meer at its eastern end.</p>
<p>Weather information (in English) VHF channel 68 at 15 mins. past every hour.</p>
