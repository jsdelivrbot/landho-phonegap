<div class="hello"><div><p>The Veerhaven is directly connected with the river. Coming in from sea, there are no obstacles such as bridges or locks. </p>
<p>In the river, keep well to the starboard side and report your intention to enter the Veerhaven via Sector Maasbruggen on VHF 81. Especially if you are approaching from the west, and have to cross the river.</p>
<p>You may enter the harbour under sail, but tacking is not permitted, and your engine must be ready for immediate use. </p>

      This historic harbour is situated in a quiet enclave of the Scheepvaartkwartier (Maritime Quarter), on the north bank of Nieuwe Maas river, between the Euromast and Erasmus Bridge. It has good modern facilities (including a launderette and WiFi) and is close to a baker, a butcher, and serveral  restaurants, as well as a wide variety of museums and the main tourist area of Rotterdam. Visiting yachts are welcome and there are reduced mooring fees for traditional sailing craft. Normal visitor fees are €1.50/metre/night (2006).
 
Beware of the current near the entrance as it can be quite strong and there is no slack water, also, watch out for the water taxi buzzing in and out.
