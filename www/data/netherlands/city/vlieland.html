<div class="hello"><div><p>In the height of the season it is sometimes closed to visitors, who then have to anchor outside.</p>
<p>Beware of the strong tidal currents when entering or leaving the narrow entrance to this harbour. This also causes whirlpools which can catch out the unwary helmsman.</p>
<p>Since the recent renovations, this harbour has good, modern facilities including a resaurant and a small provision store.</p>
<p>Many more provisions can be obtained in the village.</p>
<p>Last updated December 2010.</p>
