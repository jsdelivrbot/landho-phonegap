<p>Using a foreign mobile telephone in the Netherlands - If the cellular telephone is GSM compatible, and its current provider allows international roaming, then it may be possible to use a foreign telephone in the Netherlands. However, most providers will charge both for incoming and outgoing calls so this might be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the foreign cellular telephone with a Dutch SIM card provided the telephone is not locked. SIM cards are available at most phone shops.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> hands-free sets are mandatory when driving in the Netherlands.</p></div>
