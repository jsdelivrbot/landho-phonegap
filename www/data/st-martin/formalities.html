            </h2>
<div><p>All yachts must clear in and out of St Martin.</p>
<p>The new system now in place, is a dedicated Customs computer system, located in various offices, where you do your own entry, print it out and then have it stamped by a Customs officer or the owner of the establishment where the computer is located. All clearance in St Martin is done this way.</p>
<p>Two marinas on the French side offer clearance services, as do two chandleries with dinghy docks. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StMartin/MarigotBay">Marigot Bay</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p>If docking or at anchor elsewhere, clearance must be done at the "Gare Maritime" ferry dock. Listed opening times are 0<span>8:00 - 12:00 and 14:00 - 16:00, however these do tend to be flexible. There are</span><span> two terminals here so two boats are permitted to clear at the same time, however despite this, queues do tend to be long, outside in the hot sun. </span></p>
<p><span>See details of <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StMartin?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> below. </span></p>
<p>To speed up the clearance process, skippers can complete their details online before arrival. Go to <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://clairance.portdemarigot.com/">http://clairance.portdemarigot.com/</a></strong>. A visit however is still required to the authorities to print out all the paperwork and get passports stamped.</p>
<p>Yachts should clear in/out when sailing between the Dutch and French sides of the island.</p>
<p>When going from the French side of St. Martin to <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StBarts">St. Barths</a></strong>, no outgoing clearance is necessary (the St. Martin clearance software doesn't even have an entry for St. Barths as a destination) or possible. Boats must clear in to St. Barths as normal, but this is more a way for them to control boat traffic. When leaving St. Barths, an outgoing clearance is always necessary, even when departing for St. Martin.</p>

<div><p>All visitors (including French citizens) require a passport valid for 6 months.</p>
<p>As an overseas territory of France, and therefore a member of the EU, St Martin comes under French immigration rules, but is <strong>not</strong> a member of the Schengen Agreement Area.</p>
<p>For the exact details applicable to St Martin, see the <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary"><strong>Official French website</strong></a></p>
<p>If a visa is required, <strong>note</strong> that the visa application must specify "France + St Martin".</p>
<p>A visa valid for St Martin is also valid for Sint Maartin.</p>
<p>As international flights arrive in the Dutch Sint Maarten, crew joining a boat in French St Martin have sometimes experienced difficulties with immigration officials at the airport as they did not have either an onward or return ticket. Captains of yachts expecting crew should contact immigration beforehand to avoid this problem.</p>

<div><p><span><strong>Mosquitos: Chikungunya disease in the Caribbean</strong><br/></span><span>The first case of the disease in the Caribbean was reported in the French island of St. Martin in 2013. Since then it has spread to several countries including Dominica and Saint Lucia. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea, and rash. Joint pain and stiffness are more common with chikungunya than with dengue fever. The symptoms appear between four to seven days after the bite of an infected mosquito. The majority of clinical signs and symptoms last three to 10 days, but joint pain may persist longer. Severe cases requiring hospitalisation are rare.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Both sides of St.Martin/Sint Maarten are an area of interest due to mosquito transmission risk. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p></div>

<div><p><strong>The Sandy Ground Bridge</strong> is the main access into Simpson Bay Lagoon from the French side of the island. Access is from Marigot Bay and the bridge will accommodate vessels with a maximum beam of 32 feet and a maximum draft of 10 feet. There is a 10 foot ceiling clearance when the bridge is closed. There is a 3mph speed limit in the channel. There is no charge for any vessel using this bridge.</p>
<p><strong>OPENING TIMES </strong></p>
<p>The bridge opening times for the French side have <span>changed from 0815 to 0900 and 1430 and every day but Sunday 1730. <span>All times are for in and outbound traffic. Boats departing the Lagoon are first to move followed by the inbound boats</span></span></p>
<p><span>Many cruisers report that there is no monitoring of any VHF channel by this bridge. The official VHF Channel for the </span><span>Bridge Operator is Ch: 16 Tel: (590) 87 20 43.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers recommend the best bet to verify times is to hail Shrimpys (morning net controller) on channel 10.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Note:</b> You may find that officials do not ask to see any documentation for your pet. However cruisers who have visited the French Islands with pets advise the following:</span></p>
<p>Make sure your dog's vaccinations and rabies documentation are current, get an International Health Certificate from your local vet prior to traveling, have an international microchip and keep invoices for products such as flea/tick/heartworm treatments. It is quite possible the officials in the French Islands will not question you or care about your pet. However, if they do, you can have a local vet provide the documentation required if something is missing from your records.</p>
