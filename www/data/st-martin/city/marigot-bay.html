<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/StMartin?rc=Formalities"><strong>St Martin/Clearance</strong></a> for the details.</p>
<p>Two marinas on the French side have customs computers and offer clearance services - Marina Fort Louis and Marina Port Royale. They charge a small admin fee of a few Euros.</p>
<p><span>Be aware that only marina guests and those anchored close to the marina can check in at the marina.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The confirmed hours of Port La Royale's Capitanerie are 8:30am - 12:30pm, 2:30pm - 5:30pm.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The French authorities have now given Island Water World in Marigot - next to the Tourism Office - the official program to clear in. </span><span>They have a Dinghy Dock in the lagoon, right next to Geminga Boatyard and adjacent to the Marina Port La Royale. </span><span>Opening Times in season: Monday to Saturday 8.00am-5.00pm. 2 Euro admin fee.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can now also clear in at Budget Marine (L'Ile Marine) </span></span></span><span>St.Martin, located just outside of the Sandy Ground Bridge. It has a dinghy dock. </span><span>Open Mon-Fri 8:00-12:00 &amp; 2:00-17:00. Saturdays 8:00-12:00.

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care when entering form the French side as the channel has shifted and the markers are missing.</p>
<p>There is an anchoring fee charged in Marigot Bay of 5 Euros per day, with an initial 20 Euro charge on arrival. There is no charge for French lagoon, Grand Case, etc... only for Marigot Bay. Payment is currently based on an honour system, however a harbour patrol boat does check who is in the bay.</p>
<p>According to cruisers' reports, if you need to anchor for a couple of hours in Marigot Bay while waiting for the Sandy Ground bridge to enter the Lagoon, you will not have to pay the fees.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Be sure to lock your dinghy and everything in it (remove any loose items) when using the Marigot Bay dinghy dock. Thieves are rife here, particularly after sunset. The same applies to Grand Case and in particular to the security of your dinghy and outboard at night. To avoid having your equipment stolen, lift it out of the water and padlock it to the boat. Skippers should also consider not being away from the yacht after dark, and remove all loose items from the deck and lock all hatches when vacating the boat, and at night.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to leave your boat at anchor here unattended for an extended period of time.</p>
