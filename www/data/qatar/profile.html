<li>Qatar occupies the Qatar Peninsula, jutting north into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula.</li>
<li>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf.  Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or considering visiting ports in the area.</li>
