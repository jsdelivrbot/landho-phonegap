<div class="hello"><div><p>Sitting on the northern coast of the "tail" of Corfu island, this little port is a sleepy place which receives few visitors. The harbour is shallow and fisherman move in and out all night long creating quite a swell. However it's a lovely place for a day visit.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth at the west quay or on the end of the mole where there is room.</p>
<p>Anchor in the bay south of the mole in 2 - 3m over sand and mud. Difficult berthing/anchoring for any boat with a draft exceeding 1.80m.</p>
<p>Good shelter, although some swell can creep round into the bay.</p>
<p>Most provisions available in the village. Water on the quay is only for the fishermen.</p>
