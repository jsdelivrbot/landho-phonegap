<div class="hello"><div><p>Tucked in close to the Turkish mainland, Simi is an irregular shaped island with many useful anchorages. It was once famous for its shipbuilding having built the fast galleys used in the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>

<p>There are mixed reports about Simi as a place to check in. The officials here (as in many other places in Greece) may not be familiar with the latest regulations.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an entirely natural harbour and the centre is deep, so be prepared when  dropping anchor as the depth can be 12 to 20m.</p>
<p>There is a definite system in this harbour for berthing, whereby harbour authority personnel <span>(bright orange T shirts) allocate spaces to all visiting vessels. In general, l<span>arge motor boats and Turkish gulets are placed towards the harbour entrance; sailing boats and smaller motor boats are placed at the other end. The "boatmen" </span>will use a whistle to direct you to a space on the quay and help  with your lines. In 2012 there was an overnight charge of 10 Euros.</span></p>
<p>The South quay is now also used to moor yachts but beware of anchors  fouling each  other.</p>
<p>It is also possible to moor north of the clock tower, taking a long line ashore  to avoid the shallows close to the quay. The bottom is rocky in places so the  holding can be suspect.</p>
<p>Visit the Port Police once docked to pay port fees (6 Euros in  2012).</p>
<p>There is good shelter from the "Meltemi", but prolonged southerlies build up an  unpleasant swell.</p>
<p>The constant stream of Gulets in and out and the large ferries cause some wash,  although this appears better than previously. The harbour is generally  overcrowded.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> Due to its very indented coastline, there are many sheltered bays around the  island.</p>
<p><i>Pethi:</i> One of the most useful anchorages, being adjacent to Simi harbour.  Anchor off the pier, or in front of the hotel or tie up in the unfinished  marina. Beware of the reinforcing rods sticking out from the marina wall.  There  is a bus to the town from here.</p>
<p><i>Ay Marina:</i> Lies to the north of Simi harbour and provides a calm,  sheltered anchorage in clear water over a sandy bottom.</p>
<p><i>Panormittis:</i> This enclosed bay is on the SW corner of the island. There  maybe room on the pier or anchor in the northern part of the bay. Good holding  once through the weed. Some provisions available. Bus to Simi.</p>
