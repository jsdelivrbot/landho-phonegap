<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../greece-pics/greece_pelop_porto-kheli/@@images/image/preview"/>Porto Cheli is located in the Eastern Peloponnese 6km north of the Island of Spetses (the island in the distance in the photo). It is about 175km from Athens by road but easily reached in a couple of hours from Piraeus port.</p>
<p>It is situated in an almost landlocked bay at the head of a narrow inlet, so provides excellent sheter in all conditions. Consequently, it has developed into a popular tourist resort and is packed with all sorts of water craft and swimmers in the summer months.</p>
<p><span>When approaching Porto Kheli from the East, keep a good distance off the mainland as there are underwater rocks off Cape Aimilianos that are not always visible. </span></p>
<p>There is a small boatyard here (that cranes yachts up to 20 tons) offering some repairs and winter work and a number of yachts do spend the winter on the hard.</p>
<p>The ruins of the ancient city of Halieis are on the south side of the bay, opposite the modern day village of Porto Cheli. Some of the ruins (both on land and in the sea) are still visible.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The town quay is to port as you enter the bay. Yachts can go bow or stern-to the quay along the western side. The ferries also dock here, creating wash and noise. There are no outlets for water or power. It is likely there will be local youths on the quay directing you to a vacant spot. Whilst they will help with lines, they will also want payment. <span>Use your best judgement on how to handle this situation.</span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring here is also possible in</span><span> the large bay, the bottom is mud and holding is excellent. There are boats on permanent moorings and yachts should anchor outside the buoyed-off area. With so much space however, it should be</span><span> </span><span>no problem finding a good a</span><span>nchoring spot.</span></p>
<p><span>There are also numerous coves for anchoring along the approach inlet, with good enough shelter for overnighting.</span></p>
<p><span>This bay offers excellent all round shelter, however as the local SE wind picks up, it blows across the bay towards the town quay and can cause quite a fetch making berths on the quay rather uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span>The town offers all services: supermarkets, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, ATMs, car rental etc. Water and fuel are available by mini-tanker service. Yachts can use the ferry space when available to take on water and fuel. </span></p>
