<div class="hello"><div><p>Spetsai lies in the approaches to the large mainland bay of Argolikos Kolpos and is an affluent island. It is attractively covered in many pine trees and the main town (and only main settlement on the island) lies at the north eastern end.</p>
<p>Pretty Spetsai is a popular tourist town in the summer months, with several yards on the foreshore of the old harbour still building the traditional caiques.</p>
<p>This port can get very busy in high season and is popular with motor yachts, so if you do manage to find a space you will likely have to suffer the constant noise from their generators.</p>
<p><span>This island is well known as no cars are allowed on the island. <span>The most common modes of transport are walking, horse-drawn carriages, bicycles, mopeds, and motorbikes. There are lovely walking trails around the island and beaches close to the port as well as others accesible by local bus.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This harbour gets very crowded in the summer.</span></p>
<p>Anchoring in high season is probably going to be the only option. Try to find room either in the bay, inner harbour or in Baltiza creek, taking a long line ashore. The inner harbour has excellent holding in mud and very good shelter, and some yachts choose to winter afloat here.</p>
<p>In the outer harbour the bottom is made up of sand and weed so holding tends to be poor. Plus, there is an old mooring chain fouling the bottom in the SW corner so this area should be avoided. Strong NW winds make the outer harbour very uncomfortable, as does the wash from water-taxis.</p>
<p>The inner harbour quay may have space off-season for stern or bows-to mooring. There is water and fuel on the quay.</p>
<p>The town offers good services, with a choice of yards for haulout, good provisions and a charming town to explore.</p>
