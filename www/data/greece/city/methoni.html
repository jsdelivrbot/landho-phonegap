<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/445e920a1f1a47ce87e3dedccb7fbfd8/@@images/image/preview"/>Situated a short distance south of Pilos on the western <span>Peloponnese, Methoni is a delightful town with a pretty anchorage under a Venetian fort. <span>The off-lying Oinoussai group of islands give excellent shelter to Methoni.</span></span></p>
<p><span>It is popular with tourists because of its beautiful sandy beaches and historical remains. <span>The castle of Methoni occupies the whole area of the cape and the southwestern coast to the small islet that has also been fortified with an octagonal tower and is protected by the sea on its three sides.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Famous for its wine, this is a richly cultivated area and easily spotted by the sparkling greenhouses as you approach the coast. The fort and tower are floodlit during the summer months.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is plenty of space to anchor here, either under the breakwater or off the beach. Check your anchor as the bottom can be very weedy. You may find space to come bows-to the breakwater.</p>
<p>Shelter here is good, although it is open to the SE.</p>
<p>Water is available at the root of the breakwater or from one of the beach tavernas.</p>
