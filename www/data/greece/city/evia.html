<p>Connection to Athens by bus is cheap and straightforward from here.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are few safe, sheltered anchorages on the west coast south of Khalkis, and even fewer north of it.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/c8b37d305b1545d19e0fda2d579f6027/@@images/image/preview"/>Limni</strong></p>
<p>25km north west of Khalkis is the very attractive, small protected harbour of <strong>Limni</strong>. It is possible to berth inside the harbour which has a very narrow entrance and requires some tight maneuvering. The colour coding system used in Khalkis is also used here (red for visiting yachts - easily seen in the photo) and there are a handful of alongside berths for visitors.</p>
<p><span>The narrowest width at the entrance to the harbour is approx. 15 m of which 3-4 m has silted up. Yachts should stay as close as possible to the breakwater on entering. This space could be further restricted if there is a boat moored on the breakwater close to the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span>Water and electricity are available on the quay via an Evia Port Authority smart card. </span><span>In settled weather it is possible to moor on the outside of the mole or anchor off the village. Reported to be a very clean harbour for swimming. Good shops close to the harbour.</span></p>

<p><strong><img class="image-right" src="resolveuid/e642770e084a40798e530f56aeec37fb/@@images/image/preview"/>Orei</strong></p>
<p>On the northern coast of Evia, opposite the entrance into the Gulf of Volos, <strong>Orei</strong> is a quiet, pretty harbour, with much-improved facilities. <span>Moor stern-to on the northern side of the harbour, or on the south side if space is available. Holding is excellent.</span></p>
<p><i><span>Photo courtesy of Archie - taken from the </span><span>south quay looking across at the north quay where the majority of yachts were moored.</span></i></p>
<p><span> </span>There is now electricity and water on the quay and provisioning here is varied and easy. <span>Supermarket Orei is reasonably priced, close to the harbour and they deliver promptly without any additional cost (also exchange Camping Gas cylinders).</span><span> </span><span>Cruisers also recommend the</span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Evia?rc=RepairFacilities"> boatyard</a></strong><span> close to here for it's winter offers (see below).</span></p>
<p><strong>Kimi</strong></p>
<p>The east coast is wild, rugged and sparsely populated. The fishing port of <strong>Kimi</strong> offers good shelter from the Meltemi and has adequate services.</p>
<p>Fort the latest information on these harbours, see comments from cruisers at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><b>Boatyards</b></p>
<p>On the mainland coast, directly opposite (south of) Eretria, lies <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/EvriposCanal?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">Oropos</a></b> - an open bay and the mainland ferry terminal for Eretria. Oro<span>pos ho</span><span>uses two boatyards familiar with cruising yachts.</span></p>
