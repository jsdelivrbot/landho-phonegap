<div class="hello"><div><p>The green and mountainous island of Lefkas is also known as Nisos Levkas and Levkada.</p>
<p>The town of Lefkas is at the northern end of the island, by the bridge connecting it to the mainland. It is a popular port in which to spend the winter months.</p>
<p>Position <span>38°49.8’ N, 20°42.8’ E (Lefkas marina)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Harbours on Lefkas</span></strong><br/></p>
<p><strong>Nikiana</strong><br/> A small harbour about 7NM S of Lefkas port on the east coast of the island. Noisy as directly next to main road from mainland.</p>
<p><strong>Nidri</strong><br/> This harbour is a busy watersports centre sitting at the entrance to a large bay just over halfway down the east coast of the island. Several berthing options may be available, in addition to anchoring. Chandlery, mechanical repairs and a sailmaker are available here, as well as provisions, bank, ATM and internet cafe.</p>
<p><strong>Vliho</strong><br/> Just south of Nidri, and further into the same enclosed bay which provides good protection. There are a number of good anchorages in addition to berthing at the quay. The average depth in the harbour is 5 to 6m. Good shopping, chandlery, boatyard and repairs. Showers and laundry at the yacht club.</p>
<p><strong>Sivota</strong><br/> Delightful waterfront settlement situated in an almost landlocked bay at the southern end of the island. The approach to the bay is difficult to see until you are almost upon it. Very busy quay with local traffic and flotillas and highly likely your anchor will be fouled. Big cat population. A number of tavernas offer services and pontoon mooring in return for dinner. Is possible to anchor a distance off the quay, however depths drop quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Vasiliki</strong><br/> This harbour is on the southern coast of the island and its harbour is liable to silting up, so care should be taken with depths here. A sleepy little place now enlivened by the arrival of many watersport activities and extremely popular with wind surfers.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Lefkas Canal</strong></p>
<p>The Lefkas canal, separating the island from the mainland, has existed since ancient times. It is used mainly by local craft as a short cut to nearby Ionian islands. It has been dredged to a minimum depth of 15 ft (4.5 m). There is no toll.</p>
<p>There is a floating swing bridge (for pedestrians) on the Northern part of the canal which opens between 0800 and 2100 on the hour.</p>
<p><strong>Note: For any temporary changes to normal opening times for the Lefkas bridge see comments below.</strong></p>
<p>Improvements have been made to the northern entrance and there is now a waiting dock for yachts coming down from the north. Dredging also means there is now much more depth at this entrance.</p>
<p><span>It has been reported that it is likely that any Navonics electronic chart is inaccurate at the northern entrance to the canal, due to the shifting sand bank there. In the past, a dredger has been present here most of the time to stop the entrance from silting up. Whether this is still on station now that the depth improvements have been made, is yet to be confirmed.</span></p>
<p>The port of Lefkas is situated where the canal bends NE/SE.  Take particular note of the buoys marking the channel as you are sure to go aground if you stray outside these limits.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Anchoring has always been prohibited in the harbour, since the harbour is part of the channel and as such is considered a fairway.  In the past however, a limited number of yachts did anchor causing an obstruction to through traffic. Therefore as of summer 2009 the Port Authority have become much stricter on prohibiting anchoring. However this may be a seasonal rule as cruisers in September 2009 reported anchoring in available space for a week with no problems.</p>
<p>There may be space to berth on the town quay or otherwise use the marina.</p>
