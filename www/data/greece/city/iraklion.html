<p>The Port Authority building is located in the old Venetian port, a long walk from the outer quays.</p>
<p>The skipper should visit the Port Captain's office with the ship's documents, crew passports and vaccination certificates, if coming from abroad, or with the transit log if coming from another Greek port. Yachts clearing into Greece will be issued a transit log by the Port Captain's office, who will also advise on the procedure if any of the crew needs a visa for Greece. Yachts arriving from some areas, such as Egypt, may also be visited by a quarantine officer.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><!--old text from 2009 - Two new pontoons have been installed in the Venetian Harbour, but finding a vacant space is not easy, especially in summer. There is, however, space for yachts on one of the quays in the outer port but advised to call port authorities on entry.--></p>
<p>There is no longer any berthing available in the inner, old Venetian harbour as it is full of local boats.</p>
<p>There is, however, space for yachts on one of the quays in the outer port and yachts tend to be put on the quay under the Port Police building in the SW corner of the outer harbour. It is advisable to call the port authorities on entry to check first.</p>
<p>Note that the quay is high with limited bollards, and it can be difficult to get ashore. Most yachts use their dinghies to go ashore via the inner harbour. There is water and electricity available on the quay.</p>
<p>This quay is not really tenable in Easterly winds above 15 knots.</p>
<p>There is nowhere to anchor behind the breakwater.</p>

      This sailing club occupies the former premises of the port refrigeration plant. The large building stands east of the Port Authority building and can be identified by the frescoes of the two local heroes, Icarus and Daedalus, tumbling from heaven off the west facing wall. The small, but active, club has to its credit the successful running of the biannual Minoan Cup. Its installations, including bar and showers, are at the disposal of visiting sailors. It can also be used as a mailing address.
