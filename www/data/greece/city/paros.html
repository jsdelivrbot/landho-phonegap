<div class="hello"><div><p>The main port, Naousa, is on the northern end of the island while the small  harbour of Paroikia (the capital) lies on the NW coast.</p>
<p><strong>Naousa</strong><br/> There is a small marina here which in high season (until the first week in  September) gets very busy. Arrive in the morning if you want to find a space.  Facilities have been upgraded with clean showers and toilets and mooring lines now in place. Call the Harbour Master for a reservation (Tel: <span>+3069 42 772 023). B</span>erth where directed. Prices are  higher than in Paroikia, but water and electricity are included. There are plans to extend the breakwater to provide more protection from any swell.</p>

<p>The Meltemi does not blow as hard into Naoussa as with other nearby ports, however  the south side of the marina faces the swell directly, so during a Meltemi the  northern side of the pier is more sheltered. During the off season, northerly  storms tend to bring a nasty swell which can be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Paroikia</strong><br/> Take great care in the approach to this bay as there is a reef spanning a large  part of the entrance, through which a south flowing current of up to 2 knots can  run at times.</p>
<p>There is no Harbour Master here. Moor in the inner yacht harbour if there is space. Mostly filled with charter boats and anchor chains can get tangled here.  Shelter is good but it is subject to swell. Generally good holding and there are mooring lines laid here. Electricity and water can be unreliable.</p>
<p><span>In calm weather, berth to the outside of the N. mole.</span></p>
<p><i>Anchorages</i><br/><span>This bay has a huge number of indents and shelter can always be found somewhere. The anchorage north of the city just south of "Parko" has good holding in 4m over sand and is sheltered both from wind and waves.</span></p>
<p>There are anchorages also in the two bays opposite the town, but not in strong  southerlies.</p>
