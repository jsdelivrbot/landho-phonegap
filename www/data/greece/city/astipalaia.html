<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an almost forgotten island in the Dodecanese chain, lying as it does some 35NM west of Nisiros. It consists of two small mountains joined by a low lying isthmus. The port of Skala is on the southern coast of the westernmost island.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This island offers many good, safe, anchorages. The main port is Skala Astipalaia.</p>
<p>There is now a small marina here with an extended breakwater, with water and electricity. Moor stern or bow-to to the new quay which you will see on entering. Shelter is now good with the new breakwater, although still subject to strong gusts.</p>
<p>It is also possible anchor in the bay. The bottom is sand and weed. One report says the holding is reasonable, another, that it is good!</p>
<p>Beware of the ferry, which is large, and arrives at 7am every day, during which time it blocks the bay for an hour.</p>
<p>Maltzena lies on the southern shore of the central part of the island and the bay here provides a very protected anchorage. It it is unoccupied, it is possible to berth at the pier here. Provisions are avalable in the town.</p>
