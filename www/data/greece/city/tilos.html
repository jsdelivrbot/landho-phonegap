<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Livadhia</strong></p>
<p>Livadhia harbour sits in a large bay on the east coast of Tilos. It is a very laid back place, with the occasional ferry.</p>
<p>The harbour is small, with room for about a dozen visiting yachts. The breakwater (mole) provides excellent protection. Mooring is stern or bows-to with lazy lines on the town quay, or to the mole with your own anchor. Ferries and larger yachts tend to use the outside of the mole. Good holding.</p>
<p><span><span>There is water and electricity for most berths.</span></span></p>
<p>If the harbour is full, it is possible to anchor outside in settled weather. Take care to get the anchor through the weed to ensure it is dug in.</p>
<p>Small yachts may also be able to find a space in the fishing harbour, in the SE corner of the bay. Depths of 2m at the entrance.</p>
