<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Situated on the SE coast of the Peloponnese, 12nm north of Monemvasia, Yerakas is a useful port of refuge offering very good all-round shelter. It is tucked up a narrow entrance between cliffs with a dog-leg turn to starboard.</span></p>
<p><span>In strong northerlies a surge can develop in the harbour, but this only makes things slightly uncomfortable, not dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span>There are 2 tavernas here and very little else, just peace and quiet and lovely walking ashore.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 36° 47'13"N, 23° 05'30"E (entrance to the bay)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/2c8a1a70802f4deca7dc909fc0cbe57d/@@images/image/preview"/>The town quay here is very shallow, only suitable for shallow draft yachts. Some of the quay is marked with the depth, however, check yourself first as there are underwater rocks along the quay. Only suitable for bow or stern-to berthing. <i>(Photo courtesy of SY <span>DeDanann who visited here in 2016).</span></i></p>
<p><span>Most yachts anchor off the village in approx. 4-6m. If gusts are strong, the south side of the outer bay is more protected for anchoring.</span></p>
<p><span>At the entrance to the harbour is the old ferry quay, and yachts can berth stern-to this quay as well. Depths are adequate here to go alongside if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The bottom is mud and weed, so not everywhere is good holding. Be sure to check your anchor is holding properly.</span></span></p>
<p>There is water available on the quay and a very small grocery store. WiFi is available at the tavernas.</p>
