<div class="hello"><div><p>Approaching this port at the head of its inlet with a following F5/6 afternoon breeze, is "interesting" when undertaken for the first time!</p>
<p>There is space for at least 300 boats on the main town quay, however it can be <span>a little bumpy as the wind gusts through the harbour causing quite a swell. This normally calms down late evening. There is limited water hoses available on the quay. <span>Alongside mooring is allowed but there is a 45% surcharge and for catamarans 150%. The Port Police will ask for berthing fees (<span>see comment at bottom of page re. 2014 rates).</span></span></span></p>
<p>There is an anchorage on the eastern side of the entrance but the shelter is not so good here. The bottom is mud and the holding good.</p>
<p>The northern pier is not a quay for yacht berthing and suffers from a dangerous swell from the predominently northerly winds. Only a few berths by the root of the southern most quay offer safe shelter and are usually occuped by local craft.</p>
<p>The "new" marina on the east side of the harbour is sadly rather run down and neglected (perhaps due to its isolation). Worth looking in here on your way into the harbour to see how conditions are, but you will probably find the town quay is a better option.</p>
