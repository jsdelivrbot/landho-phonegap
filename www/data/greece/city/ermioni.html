<div class="hello"><div><p>Tucked into a bay at the western end of the Gulf of Hydra, Ermioni is a busy little port, but relatively untouched by tourism.</p>
<p>It's easily spotted from seaward as the village spreads over the headland and the point of the headland is covered in trees. As you enter the harbour, keep clear of the headland as there is an ancient mole that extends out to sea from its northern side.</p>
<p>The large bay immediately south of Ermioni (Kapari) offers good shelter in the SW corner and holding is good. There are also some tavernas here that have pontoons for docking. It is however open to the N/NW.</p>
<p>The bay north of Ermioni (Dardiza) is also a popular spot to anchor.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Ermioni North</strong></p>
<p>This harbour gets very busy in the summer and it's likely there will be no space to berth on the central quay. Its hammerhead is for ferry use only.</p>
<p>Yachts can try and find a space on the outer mole, either side is possible although take care on the outside as there is a ledge 2m underwater. Holding is patchy. Take care as well with swell (from both the wind and ferry wash) and be sure to pull yourself well off the mole.</p>
<p>This harbour gives adequate shelter, but is open to the NE and can get uncomfortable when the wind blows strongly off the hills.</p>
<p>In <span>settled weather it is possible to anchor in the bay north of the breakwater. Try to get as far north as possible to escape the swell that comes into the bay, but be aware that it is subject to strong gusts from the NW. Ensure the anchor is well dug in.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ermioni South</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In off-shore winds, there is a quiet berth on the south side of the peninsula. Moor to the small concrete quay there, clear of any fishing boats, in 2-5m. This spot is exposed to easterlies and southerlies. No water on this quay.</span></p>
