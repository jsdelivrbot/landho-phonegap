<div class="hello"><div><p>Opened in 1893, the canal separates mainland Greece from the Peloponnese. It has a length of 4 miles (about 6 km) and a depth of 26 ft (8 m). The canal came under private management in September 2001.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The cut is too narrow for ships to pass each other, so one must get permission to proceed. All vessels should contact the Isthmia control tower on VHF channel 11 before entering the canal in order to find out what time to be at the canal entrance. There are waiting areas at both ends. Pilotage is not compulsory.</span></p>
<p><span>Yachts follow the commercial ships, which are taken through by tug. Do not follow too closely in order to avoid the prop wash.</span></p>
<p>Payment can only be made at the Isthmia side (Eastern) where small yachts can dock, and should bring their documents to the Customers Service Dept., located in the basement of the Control Tower. Payment can be made either in cash or by credit card.</p>
<p>Fees (April 2013) are based on length and are as follows:-</p>
<p>Less than 6 meters: 50 Euros<br/> From 6 to 9 meters: 80 Euros<br/> From 9.01 to 15 meters: 80 Euros + (L.O.A. - 9)* 23<br/> From 15.01 to 25 meters: 80 Euros + (L.O.A. - 9)* 25<br/> More than 25 meters: 80 Euros + (L.O.A. - 9)* 27</p>
<p><span>On top of these fees VAT might apply, at time of writing 23%. <br/>The online form for computing transit fees (<a href="http://www.aedik.gr/frontend/fee_calculator.php" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.aedik.gr/frontend/fee_calculator.php</strong></a>) automatically includes VAT.</span></p>
<p>Only vessels requesting a tug have to pay a surcharge.</p>
<p>Private yachts both Greek and foreign pay the same amount; however Greek yachts (private &amp; charter) registered in Isthmia, Loutraki and Corinth pay a lower fee.</p>
<p>A vessel can only enter the canal when a permit has been granted by the Canal Service. The canal now has red above green lights on both port and starboard side of the canal at both ends.</p>
<p>By day and night: a green light is shown when entry is permitted, and a red light when entry is not permitted (but only after verbal permission to enter has been granted). Usually you will join a convoy which has large ships at the head.</p>

<p>The canal is nominally closed on a Tuesdays (06:00 to 18:00) , whether this happens can depend on the amount of traffic.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>At the western entrance of the canal, Corinth Yacht Harbour is to the SW. This is the best berth for yachts under 20m. Larger yachts must contact the Port Authorities on VHF 12 or 16 to obtain permission to berth in the commercial harbour. See comments at bottom of page re. latest information on berthing here.</p>

      It is particularly difficult to berth here, especially if freeboard is low, as the jetty is on tall stilt piles. It is better at the eastern end where there is at least a cross beam to moor against, though you might have to ignore the gesticulating Port Police to do it!. <br>
Larger yachts can request a pilot boat to come out with the paperwork.<br>
There is an anchorage in Ormos Kalamaki, just north of the entrance, although this is quite deep until close inshore (see comment at bottom of page).<br>
You may pay with cash or credit card.
<br><br>
Beware of the strain on the mooring ropes when a large ship passes - it may be advisable to wait away from the canal entrance.

      Phone to check opening hours and then call on VHF on approach. Missing your convoy can involve a 2 hour wait. Yachts follow the commercial ships, which are taken through by tug.<br>
Dangerous to  moor alongside inner quay running NW-SE as
unmarked rocks.<br><br>

Within the yacht harbour, DO NOT berth alongside the inner quay as there are unmarked rocks and there is a tidal range of about 0.8m here at springs.<br><br>

Payment is made at the eastern end.

      Small harbour with good shelter alongside wooden pontoons or bows/stern-to the quay. Water on middle pier (long hose needed). Limited space for larger yachts. Fuel can be delivered to boat or fetched from the fuel station in town.<br>
Within the yacht harbour, DO NOT berth alongside the inner quay as there are unmarked rocks and there is a tidal range of about 0.8m here at springs. The middle pier also has shallow depths.
