<div class="hello"><div><p>This tiny harbour gets very full in the height of the season. There is not much room, so be well prepared before entering. Berth wherever there is room. The bottom is very soft mud.</p>
<p>In settled weather or off-shore winds, it is possible to anchor off the beach to the west of the entrance. The holding is good in sand. Alternatively, there is a good anchorage just south of the harbour in 10m over sand.  Larger yachts will need to anchor outside anyway.</p>
<p>There are (currently) no harbour dues.</p>
