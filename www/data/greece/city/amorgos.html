<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying SE of Naxos, this is one of the most easterly of the Cyclades. It is a long, thin island with spectacular cliffs that drop vertically into the sea in many places, particulary in the NE and South coasts. It is generally off the tourist route, although not the quiet relaxed place it used to be, especially in July and August.</p>
<p>The "Chora" (main city) up in the mountains is well worth visiting as it is probably the last original traditional Cyclade village.</p>
<p>When the Meltemi is blowing it can be very rough off the NW and SE sides of the island with severe gusts in the south.</p></div></div>

<p>This pretty little port is at the head of a deep bay towards the western end of the NW coast. There is space for approx. 20 yachts to tie stern-to the quay (between the 2 ferry berths). Water and power is available.</p>
<p><i>(Photo of town quay courtesy of SY Big Sky - taken May 2016).</i></p>
<p>Take care with your anchor chain as the inner ferry berth is used by a small ferry which lays its anchor a good distance off.</p>
<p><span>There are several good anchorages in the bay itself.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ormos Ayios Annas</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Tucked just inside the NW part of the island this small harbour lies off the village of Yialis in the SE of the bay. It is always quite crowded and if berthed on the town quay can be noisy with music from the waterfront bars. Moor Med-style to the quay clear of the ferry. Holding is not that good. </span></p>
<p><span>The bay is open to the W-NW so can be uncomfortable with strong gusts into the bay during the Meltemi. There is water on the quay and a mini-market.</span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring here can be rolly and is only recommended in calm weather.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>There are good anchorages along the northern side of the island; Kalotiri and Kalotaritissa to name a few.</p>
