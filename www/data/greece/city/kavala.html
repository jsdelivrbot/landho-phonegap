<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour consists of inner and outer basins. There is rarely room for yachts among the fishing and work boats in the inner harbour. If there is room, check if it is alright to moor in their first. Otherwise, moor on the north quay in the outer harbour. The quay wall is high and getting ashore is not easy (see comments below from MY LeeZe who visited here in 2015). Power and water are available, but limited. The shelter is good, as is the holding in the mud of the harbour bottom.</p>
<p>The yacht club is private with no facilities for visiting yachts. Their berths are painted white.</p>
<p>If seeking shelter, there is a storm anchorage on the far west side of the harbour with good holding.</p>
