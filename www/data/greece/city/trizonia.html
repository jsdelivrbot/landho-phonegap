<div class="hello"><div><p>This quiet backwater of an island lies just off the northern shore of the Gulf of Corinth.</p>
<p>There is a large sunken ketch in the marina close by the western side of the first pontoon. This has been around for several years and is even visible on Google Earth. The wreck extends well into the channel so take care.</p>
<p>The harbour has rather a deserted air, with <span>most of the piers </span><span>occupied by deserted, dirty old boats. However, the village is very pleasant and the harbour provides useful shelter.</span></p>
<p>Position <span>38°21.2'N, 22°05.1'E.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The village, with its small (unfinished) marina, is tucked into the northern corner of the bay on the eastern side of the island. The locals are reported to be very friendly and helpful.</p>
<p>Berth in the marina if there is room (the outside of the mole is reported to have good depths). <span>There is no electric available. Water can be found on the north side of the marina next to the track, by going alongside one of the deserted yachts and extending the hose. It is free and good quality.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, anchor in the bay inside the 5m contour and clear of the marina entrance. The holding is good once through the weed.</p>
<p>A good, sheltered place, possible for over-wintering.</p>

      50 berths on pontoons. Never finished. No services, but free moorings with good shelter. Moor alongside the 2 breakwaters or stern too on the two pontoons. The middle pier and outer pier can be used by visitors, be careful with your fenders because the concrete has very sharp stones protruding. Berthing is free. Beware of hazards, such as open manholes on the breakwaters. One
water outlet adjacent to the track on the north side of the marina, opposite the second pontoon.<br>
Despite the minimal facilities there are good restaurants, a small minimarket for basic food essentials. Ferry to the mainland is half a mile away.
