<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Naxos Port</strong></p>
<p>This is the main port of the island on the west coast, directly opposite <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Paros">Paros</a></b>. The harbour entrance can easily be seen by the conspicuous breakwater and ferries coming and going. The town is charming, good for provisions and eating out.</p>
<p>There is a marina here (VHF Ch. 69) however it is very crowded with local boats and it's recommended to arrive early in order to ensure finding a space. Piers are concrete with water and electricity. Although there are some tailed moorings, the majority are now missing so use of your own anchor is essential.</p>
<p><b><i>Take care: </i></b>There is a chain on the bottom approx. 30m from the southern pontoon. Bear this in mind when dropping your anchor to try and avoid fouling.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the harbour just south of the rock with the conspicuous ancient "Portal" monument, under the breakwater. Again, take care to keep clear of the cable running parallel to the mole (marked on charts). Anchor close to the beach in 3 to 5m as further out exposes you to the uncomfortable wash from the ferries. The holding is good and the anchorage well protected.</p>
<p>Alternatively anchor on the NE side of the isthmus joining Nisis Vakkhos to Naxos. You will need to take a long line ashore. Good holding here and whilst it is open to the Meltemi, it is sheltered from southerlies.</p>
<p>There is a harbour master here during the summer months, but out of season fees should be paid at the port police office.</p>
<p><strong>Kalantos (<strong>Ormos Kalando)</strong></strong></p>
<p>This small, remote port is on the south east coast, approx. 1.5 miles NE of Ak Katomeri. It provides very good shelter in all winds (although there may be gusts into the bay) and there is good holding in sand. The fishing harbour on the eastern side of the bay may have room for 1 or 2 yachts berthed alongside, suitable in calm weather. There is water and electricity on the pier, but no other services, and a small bar is open only in high season. Fishermen can provide fresh fish at a good price.</p>
