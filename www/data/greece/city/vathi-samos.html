<div class="hello"><div><p><span><span>This harbour is open to the North and NW and the land formation is like a funnel, so the swell from the consistently blowing N, NE or NW winds pushes water into the bay, which circulates around</span></span><span> setting up a confused swell inside the bay. </span></p>
<p><span>Big ferries coming and going on the opposite side of the town quay also create alot of wash so conditions can be challenging here. Although not dangerous, it is uncomfortable. See Cruisers tips below in comments on best places to moor.</span></p>
<p>Moor to the quay in the NE corner, keeping clear of the ferry berths. The area next to these berths is reserved for mega-yachts. If berthing alongside it is wise to lay an anchor to keep the yacht pulled off the quay.</p>
<p>Mooring on the quay is reported to be free, as is water and electricity.</p>
<p>If you are small yacht, there may be space in the small yacht haven SE of the quay. There is approx. 3m depth here and laid moorings.</p>
<p>There is water and electricity available on both quays. Fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker.</p>
