<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor bows/stern-to the West quay in the inner harbour. The bottom is sand and mud with good holding. Beware of the shallows to port (marked by an un-lit beacon) at the entrance to the inner harbour. With the Meltemi blowing, strong gusts will be experienced in the approaches.</p>
<p>The shelter from NW'ly winds is excellent.</p>
<p>The yacht marina here opened in 2009, located just to the east of the outer harbour. Facilities however are basic and cruisers who visited in 2014 have posted useful comments below.</p>
<p>It is a 15 minutes walk from the town.</p>
