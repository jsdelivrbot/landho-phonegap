<div class="hello"><div><p>Port police and customs are based here. Cruisers have reported personnel as being "difficult".</p>
<p>Although in theory you can clear customs and obtain a crusing permit from the customs building, in May 2010 we were told they no longer had the necessary forms and that yachts should go to Corfu for clearance.</p>
<p>In Corfu - go to Gouvia Marina 4.5nm west of the city, where clearance is simple and straightforward. Office open 0900-1430 during the summer season.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/gaiosmap_PeterTerHaar.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>This harbour can be approached either from the north or the south end. Each has its own hazards. The northern entrance is used by ferries and tripper boats and it is impossible to see round the blind bend where the channel turns south past the main part of the town. The southern entrance is shallow with many rocks and little room to manoeuvre, therefore it is advisable to anchor and go in with the dinghy if you prefer not to dock.</p>
<p>Docking here is controlled by the Corfu Port Authority. A representative will come by your boat to collect overnight fees. See comments below for latest fees reported.</p>
<p><i>(See docking map courtesy of Peter Ter Haar)</i>. The northern quay - <i>top yellow </i>- is for yachts to moor at, there is no time restriction here however this is a busy harbour and finding space can be difficult.</p>
<p>The town quay - <i>middle yellow plus photo </i>- must be left clear for the ferries and day tripper boats. M<span>ost of these arrive arround 11:00 and leave arround 16:00. Therefore yachts can moor on the town quay overnight between </span><span>17:00 and 10:00 if space can be found.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/Gaios_townquay_PTerHaar.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/>Further south near the harbour breakwater opening, yachts can also moor for more extended time - <i>marked green</i>. This quay has water and electricity available <i>(blue spots)</i>. There is no water or electricity at the other quays.</p>
<p>The holding here is good in the mud. Fouled anchor chains seem to be impossible to avoid here, so be prepared!</p>
