<div class="hello"><div><p>The island offers several anchorages, mostly on the eastern side, and several others clustered near the small off-shore island of Loukas on the western side.</p>
<p>A mile south of Loukas is the small quay at Merikha.</p>
<p>The small port of Loutra is on the NE coast and be aware that there is very little room to manover once inside. Moor to the NE mole or alongside either side of the outer quay. There is good shelter inside the basin, but outside can be subject to strong gusts in a <code>meltemi</code>.</p>
