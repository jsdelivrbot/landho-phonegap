<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying just south of the Peloponnese mainland, this island can be a useful stop on the way to Crete. The principle port is Dhiakofti, halfway down the east coast of the island.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Pelagia</strong><br/>On the island's NE coast this old ferry port has good docking on the breakwater <span>with good depths (water at the root of the breakwater and a minimarket). Yachts can also tie up to the old ferry quay, now redundant. There is a choice of tavernas and a minimarket. Suitable for settled weather, but best avoided with winds from the NW. </span></p>
<p><strong>Dhiakofti</strong><br/>Situated half way down the island's east coast this is the main ferry port. Moor to the south side of the quay. There are card operated water and electricity boxes.</p>
<p>Shelter is good in all but strong NE'lies. This is a busy ferry harbour, however it only really wakes up when a ferry comes in. Minimarket.</p>
<p>In westerly winds it is best to use the anchorage on the east side of the island of Makronisos. The holding is reasonably good in weed and sand.</p>
<p><strong>Kapsali</strong><br/> A very quiet harbour on the south coast of the island. Moor in the western bay as the smaller one east of it is very shallow (&lt;1m). Med moor to the quay (water and electricity boxes available). Can be subject to swell and is untenable in strong southerlies. If anchoring, be sure to anchor outside the inner bay well clear of the approaches to the harbour. Provisions and tavernas available. Space is normally tight during the summer months as Kapsali has become popular with young Greeks who flock here with their motorboats.</p>
