<div class="hello"><div><p>Leros is a green, wooded island, with rounded hills instead of the harsher landscape of some of the other islands in the group. It lies to the SE of Patmos and close to the north of Kalimnos (its sister island).</p>
<p>The harbour of Lakki is at the head of a deep bay in the south western part of the island and offers good shelter. There are two boatyards on the island with good facilities, ample hard standing and repair services. With ferries to Piraeus and Rhodes and direct flights to Athens, this is a possible option for wintering your boat in Greece.</p>
<p>Position <span>37° 06'36"N, 26° 49'40"E (approach to Lakki)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>With the Meltemi</span> there are strong gusts off the high land in the approaches to Ormos Lakki<span> as well as a confused sea.</span></p>
<p><span>The Port of Lakki (Porto Lago) is now very well protected by a new sea wall.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marinas</strong></p>
<p>There are two marinas here; one each side at the head of the Lakki Bay, and both are close to the town.</p>
<p>Leros Marina is well sheltered and is to starboard as you enter (37° 07.7'N, 26° 51.4'E) and Lakki Marina is to port (37° 07.8'N, 26° 50.9'E).</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong></p>
<p><span>Some boats anchor in the basin between Lakki and Leros marinas, and sea side of the commercial dock. </span></p>
<p>Good shelter can be found in the anchorage at Lepida on the eastern side of the bay, just north of the naval base.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the island, (across from Lakki Bay) at Pandeli Bay is a good sheltered harbour as well as an anchorage in 6-7m with good holding.</p>
<p>The anchorage at <span>Partheni, on the northern tip of the island, in the bay to the east by the village, is well sheltered. There is a boatyard with a travel lift by the airstrip.</span></p>
<p><span>Xirokampos, at the southern end of the island, also provides good shelter. Some restaurants here have mooring buoys for patrons. No provisioning available. See comments for more details at bottom of page.</span></p>
