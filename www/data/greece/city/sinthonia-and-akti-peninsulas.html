<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Two long, narrow peninsulas either side of the Gulf of Singitik. The Sinthonia Peninsula to the west and the Atki Peninsula to the east make up 2 of the 3 "fingers" of the much larger Khalkidhiki Peninsula to the north. (The other being the </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/KassandraPeninsula">Kassandra Peninsula</a></strong><span>).</span></p>
<p>The Atki Peninsula is an incredible place that has at its southernmost tip Mount  Athos considered since antiquity the Holy Mountain and the house of God. This  “closeness” to God has attracted monks and hermits and for over 1,000 years the  Akti Peninsular was isolated from the rest of the world. Following some  apparently scandalous behaviour between the monks and shepherdesses in the 11th  Century it was decreed that no females, human or animal would be allowed on the  peninsular except for cats (to keep the rat population down).</p>
<p>Sadly though, signs that this monastic lifestyle is dwindling can be seen by the  numerous day tripper boats full of young ladies circling the peninsula and the  satellite dishes and solar panels which have now become permanent fixtures on  the majority of the monasteries.</p>
<p>Seventeen monasteries perch, sometimes precariously, at various heights on the  craggy mountains around its shores. Most are vast and reminiscent of those in  Tibet. In addition there are small communities and hermitages dotted between and  it is quite a challenge to try and spot the hermits that live totally isolated  in caves on the southern slopes of Mount Athos.</p>
<p>Passing boats must keep more than 500m off and it is likely you will be visited  by the Greek coastguard. Men can visit and trek between the monasteries but must  apply for a permit first. They can stay in the monasteries and will be fed and  accommodated for nothing.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Sinthonia</strong></p>
<p>On the western shores of this peninsula yachts can find a number of places to berth, as well as a couple of good anchorages. Nikitas, Nea Marmaras, Porto Carras and Porto Koufo can all offer berths.</p>
<p>The eastern shore has a number of attactive anchorages, but only the small fishing harbour of Alkladhi, just north of Sarti, has a mole for bows-to mooring. Panayia, north of Nisis Dhiaporos further north, has a pontoon for visiting yachts opposite the town with water.</p>
<p><strong>Akti</strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt the best way to see the Atki peninsula is from the sea. Almost  every monastery that is on the water has a beautiful, new and protected harbor  that is totally empty, but don’t try to enter into them because you will be  chased away in a very unfriendly manner.</p>
<p>Yachts not permitted in the bay of Vatopedi on the NE of the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Lerissos, tucked up inside the gulf at the root of the Atki Peninsula, is the safest  place  to leave a yacht if visiting the Peninsula by local ferry. Moor wherever there is space among the fishing boats (there is alot of floating buoys and sea bed debris in this harbour).</p>
<p>Nisis Ammouliani, an island located between the Sinthonia and Akti peninsulas, offers some good anchorages, but the village no longer has a  fuel station.  Avoid the central ferry quay in Ammouliani village and use the mole for berthing instead. Anchoring off the village is not recommended with the strong NE winds, however there is a bay South of the caique harbour suitable  for anchoring with good shelter and holding. It is possible to walk into the  village for provisions from here.</p>
<p>The attractive village of Pirgadhikia at the head of the gulf between the 2 peninsulas has a new quay. Currently no facilities but approx. space for 20 boats.</p>
