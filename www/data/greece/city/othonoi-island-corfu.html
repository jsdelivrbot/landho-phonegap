<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../Corfu_Othoni_newjetty_PeterTerHaar.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Ammos is the port of Othoni. The old harbour, previously very shallow and small, has now been greatly improved <i>(image courtesy of Peter Ter Haar)</i>.</p>
<p>A large new breakwater extends out from the port in an E direction, approx. 100m long, creating a clear entrance channel into the port. Inside the breakwater runs a new fixed jetty<i> (red in the photo)</i> to which visiting boats can tie alongside. It is also possible to moor alongside the concrete quay opposite, on the north side of the channel <i>(yellow in the photo)</i>.</p>
<p><span>The outer channel leading into the port is well marked and has 3.5 to 4.5m depth. There are two large outer markers, a red and a green, both lit, to the SE of the entrance. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p>Boats can also anchor in a small bay to the West of Ammos harbour, which has a small breakwater and concrete dock for the ferry<i> (see area of cloud to the left of the photo)</i>. Whilst a ferry runs to and from this bay, there does not appear to be any problems with anchoring here. Outside of ferry times, yachts can use the ferry landing if required.</p>
<p>This bay is much closer to Othoni village. It's an approx. 600m walk from the new docks, around the coast into Othoni. The village has a small supermarket and several bars and restaurants.</p>
<p><span>The prevailing winds here are mostly N/NW, so the most sheltered place to berth is in the new harbor. If anchoring in the bay, you will likely feel the the wind but there is little or no fetch. </span></p>
