<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor stern-to to the town quay. Ensure the anchor is well dug in. Strong W or NW winds cause a surge and care is needed to keep clear of the quay.</p>
<p>Two alternative anchorages are; Monastry bay, to the NW of the harbour and Middle Bay, south of the harbour. Make sure the anchor penetrates the weed and the mud will provide good holding.</p>
