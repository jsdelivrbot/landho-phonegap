<div class="hello"><div><p>Rethimno (NW Crete) is an old Venetian Harbour, very quaint and the buildings with wooden balconies are a reminder of the Turkish occupation. Worth timing your visit for is the Cretan wine festival, held in the last week of July. The marina provides good shelter.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>On entry proceed with caution as there is often a rolling swell here. The marina is to port on entry, the old harbour directly ahead.</p>
<p>In the marina, yachts should berth where directed, or where they can find space. It tends to be quite full of local boats in the south. Most berths have laid moorings, but the l<span>azy lines tend to be short and very thick. Larger boats are permitted to go alongside. Maximum length is 17m. Depths are 2.5-4m.</span></p>
<p><span>In the old harbour, you may find a space on the southern quay inbetween all the commercial boats. As space is tight here, it is best to check first that space is available before entering.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a very secure anchorage and there is a good place to anchor off the beach inside the breakwater.</span></p>
<p>There is good shelter even from the "Meltemi" in the East of the harbour.</p>
<p>Water is available everywhere and electricity at the marina at most berths.</p>
