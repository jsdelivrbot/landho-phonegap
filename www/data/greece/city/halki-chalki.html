<div class="hello"><div><p id="content"><img class="image-left" src="../../greece-pics/greece_halki_con-sprenger/@@images/image/preview"/>During the sailing season a short, t-shaped, pontoon is placed just north of the ferry dock with water, but no power. A harbour master will direct visiting yachts to a berth for stern-to docking on own anchor. <i>(Photo courtesy of Con Sprenger).</i></p>
<p><span>When docking on the south side be aware of some cement blocks and old ropes </span><span>on the bottom. On the east side, depths are 10 to 20 meters and on the north side drop your anchor </span><span>in front of the house with the green shutter – about 50 meters out. </span></p>
<p><span>Docking fees are about 1 euro </span><span>per meter and include water.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Anchoring is possible in the north part of the bay or in a small bay to the south just around the </span><span>corner from the main harbour.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The water here is crystal clear and popular for swimming </span><span>by boaters and locals – please use holding tanks.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The town around the harbour has slowly been renovated and restored with beautiful multi</span><span>coloured houses. The harbour front has many restaurants and cafés with free internet, there are </span><span>a few small supermarkets, a bakery, post office and souvenir shops. The winding narrow streets </span><span>behind the harbour are fun to explore.</span></p>
