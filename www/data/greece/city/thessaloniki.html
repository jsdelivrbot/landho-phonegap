<div class="hello"><div><p>This important commercial port lies at the head of the Gulf of Thermai. Although it is a huge industrial city, Thessaloniki has many interesting archaeological sites and museums encompassing its Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history.</p>
<p>It is visible from a long distance off with large commercial ships anchored in the bay and the cranes on the docks easily sighted from afar.</p>
<p>Note there is a traffic separation scheme in the Gulf and off Thessaloniki, so commercial ships have right of way. Keep a listening watch on VHF Ch. 16.</p>
<p>Position 40°38.6'N, 22°55.6'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large commercial port (the 2nd largest in Greece) and yachts should go to the Aretsou marina, which is situated on the eastern shore, south of the commercial docks, in the green and wooded suburb of Aretsou.  There is good all round shelter inside the marina, where an attendant will direct you to a berth.</p>
<p>If previously arranged, it may be possible to berth at the yacht harbour at Mikro Emvolon or the Nautical Club of Thessaloniki. The yacht harbour is north of the marina and the yacht club north of that.</p>

      This former fishing harbour provides good shelter. Difficult to spot however there is a conspic. white chapel on the end of the inner breakwater which helps. Located just west of Aretsou marina. Water, electricity, some laid moorings, some small repairs, provisions close by. Fuel by mini-tanker. Previously arranging a berth is necessary as it is a private harbour.
