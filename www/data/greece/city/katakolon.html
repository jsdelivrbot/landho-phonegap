<div class="hello"><div><p>Tucked into the nothern corner of the large shallow bay of Kiparissiakos Kolpos, this port is on the west coast of the Peloponnese mainland.</p>
<p>It is the most convenient place from which to visit the ruins of Olympia and is a regular stop for cruise ships. Note, yachts must give way to cruise ships at all times.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware that in strong easterlies, a swell enters the harbour and this can make getting on and off boats berthed here almost impossible.</p>
<p><span>There are yacht berths on the northern side of the harbour in the yacht basin. Boats go stern or bows-to on the western quay here and there is water and electricity available for some berths. Holding and shelter are reported to be good.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruise ships dock on the town quay, to the south.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, anchor NE of the low mole on the northern side of the harbour. The holding here is good and the shelter excellent over a large area of the bay.</p>
<p>A person will come by the boat to collect berthing fees. See latest charges reported below in comments.</p>
