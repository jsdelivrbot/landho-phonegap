<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/c8c5bcb0349846c39c1a2f4e037408a7/@@images/image/mini"/>A dome-shaped island in the Middle Cyclades, roughly midway between Kithnos and Milos. Although the high ground appears barren, the island is ringed with trees and inland there are several lush, green valleys. A quiet place off the tourist map, renowned for its good food, with a wonderful "chora" (old town) perched high up on the hill<i> (photos courtesy of SY Big Sky)</i>.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/greece-pics/greece_cyclades_serifos-harbour/@@images/image/preview"/>The port of Livadhi is at the head of a bay on the SE corner of the island. Take great care if the Meltemi is blowing as there can be very strong gusts off the south coast and in the approaches to the port.</p>
<p><span>A new harbour has been built here with solid concrete piers and lazy lines and good all-round protection. Note however that the floating pontoon does not have lazy lines along its full length, so if berthing at the end you will have to use your own anchor. Take care of the ground chain when anchoring. </span></p>
<p><span>There is electricity and water on the docks. <span>On the old pier, which is part of the newly built harbour, a waterman comes around to dispense water and a few of the electrical outlets are still activated.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yachts can also anchor in the bay outside the buoyed swimming area, although holding is patchy in sand and weed (a 2nd anchor is recommended). Use plenty of chain. <span>Anchoring should not be attempted in strong southerlies. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>The town has plenty of small supermarkets, some coffee shops, restaurants with free Wi-Fi and a bank with ATM. There is a sandy beach at the end of the bay. </span></p>
