<div class="hello"><div><p>This island is a popular destination being so close to mainland Greece. It has good ferry connections and an airport. The town of Skiathos is a lively, but pleasant and relaxed sort of place. There is a new harbour here, and an anchorage close by.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>On approach from the south, it is advisable to keep the little island of N. Dhaskalo to port. On-going work to extend the outer breakwater means the area to the west of N. Dhaskalo should be avoided.</span></p>
<p>In the harbour, moor bows/stern-to on the northern part of the quay (the extreme north is reserved for day trip boats and the pontoon in the north for charter boats). It might be difficult to find space, especially at weekends, when the charter fleet is in. Both the shelter and the holding are good. It is advisable to call ahead on VHF channel 77 (Skaithos marina) to ask for a berth.</p>
<p>Water and electricity is now available on the quay here (new 2015). Contact the harbourmaster for connection. Fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker.</p>
<p>The wash in the harbour caused by the frequent arrival/departure of the ferries could make the anchorage at the head of the bay, a more attractive proposition. Keep clear of the prohibited area under the flight path to the airport. The holding here, in 4 - 6m of sand, is very good. Care is needed to avoid the many moorings here.</p>
<p>As with many ports in this area, take care if the wind is from the south as this port can be uncomfortable, possible untenable.</p>
<p>Yachts are hauled out here and there are some repair facilities, chandlers and hardware stores.</p>

      The charter companies control most berths on the pontoon and on the town quay. Call ahead for a berth. Best time is midweek.
