<div class="hello"><div><p>An interesting port, approached by a long canal, set amid shallow salt marshes on the northern shore of the Gulf of Patras. Famous in Greek history due to its heroic fight for the country's independance in the 19th century. Lord Byron, the poet, supported this struggle and is buried here.</p>
<p>Keep to the middle of the canal to avoid the shallows to the east. It is dredged to 6m.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is now a marina here - visitors use the detached pontoon. Every boat has access to water, electric, hot showers (if you avoid the rush hours) and  toilets ashore. The pontoons are wide and are gated. However, most of the time the gates are left open so it's only marginally more secure than the public quay.</p>
<p>There is much cheaper berthing possible at the southern end of the town quay (stern-to with bow anchor) -marked with green stripes - but rafting up is usual here in the season. Avoid in a west wind when it can get uncomfortable here. No facilities, except water.</p>
<p>The anchorage in the harbour is safe in all weather, but there were mixed reports in 2015 as to whether anchoring was permitted in the harbour. Some cruisers reported being moved, other were allowed to stay for one night. Reports in 2016 indicate that boats are now anchoring here with no problems.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor free in the lagoon, keeping clear of the centre in case of commercial shipping movements.</p>
<p>It is not permitted to berth on the fisherman's quay.</p>
<p>There are four chandleries here (a good one in the marina office building).</p>
<p>During the summer, the loud disco music might be a disincentive to remain here for long!</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Thefts have been reported from boats on the public quay and there have been thefts from boats at anchor too. Therefore appropriate security measures should be taken to ensure nothing of value is visible or unsecured on deck, and the boat is locked at all times.</p>
<p>Report any theft to the Hellenic Coast Guard on <br/> <strong>Tel;</strong> +<span>30 26310 51211 / <strong>Fax:</strong> 51121</span></p>
