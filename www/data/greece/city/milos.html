<div class="hello"><div><p>The port of Adhamas is in the NE corner of the deep bay, Ormos Miliou, on the northern coast of the island.</p>
<p>Moor on the north quay or to the west side of the pier on the eastern side of the harbour. There are about 50 berths in total here. Good shelter even in a <code>meltemi</code>, but it is advisable to moor several metres out due to the chaos caused by the twice daily arrival of the ferry.</p>
<p>In a strong southerly wind, one of the anchorages close in on the western side of the bay would be better.</p>
<p>The two off-lying islands of Kimolos and Poliagos provide several good anchorages.</p>
