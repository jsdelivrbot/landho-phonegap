<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor where there is space. The designated visitors' quay is usually occupied with local boats. Asking at the office is often no help! Shelter is excellent with winds from all directions.</p>
<p>This marina is not situated in the best of areas, being located in the rather dreary suburbs of Athens. Not the safest of places to either leave the boat or to walk around alone at night. Neither is it quiet, as there is a very loud disco/bar on site! At least, now the new airport is open, the noise from the old one near by is much reduced.</p>
<p>One report states: "the only civilised toilet facilities are retained by the marina authorities for their own use so all the yachts use on-board facilities and dump their sewage in the marina".</p>
