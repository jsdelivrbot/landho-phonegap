<div class="hello"><div><p>Siros is a fairly rugged, barren island in the Northern Cyclades. The north is bare and largely uninhabited, while the south is more populated with gentle cultivated slopes.</p>
<p>The Port Siros (Ermoupolis) is midway down the eastern coast and is a busy, interesting town. There are a few boatyards here where yachts can haulout.</p>
<p>The western coast offers several small ports/anchorages, but only Finikas has anything more than tavernas and some basic provisions (it also has water).</p>
<p>Position 37°31'N, 24°53'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Port Siros (Ermoupolis)</strong></p>
<p><span>This is a bustling harbour and town and a lively alternative to its quieter neighbouring islands. Moor on the north east side of the harbour using your own anchor. The ferries create quite a bit of wash here so take care. When approaching, keep to the east to avoid the commercial activity close to the entrance. The bottom is mud and the holding, good.</span></p>
<p>Excellent shelter from northerly winds, but southerlies can cause an unpleasant swell, and strong winds from this direction can make the quay a dangerous place for yachts. It can also get quite smelly here in the summer.</p>
<p>Water, electricity and fuel are available on the quay.</p>
<p>The marina, in the south of the bay, offers good protection but is some way from the town.</p>
<p><strong>Finikas</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The harbour here is located in the NW corner of the bay and is a more peaceful harbour than Ermoupolis with good shelter. You may find space inside the harbour, however the majority of yachts tend to moor bow/stern-to off the south side of the outer mole, where there is good protection from the prevailing wind. Be sure however to pull your boat a good distance back from the mole, as the wash from passing ferries can cause a surge.</p>
<p><span>It is also possible to anchor off the beach outside the marked swimming area in sand and weed with good holding. Watch out for laid moorings. </span></p>
<p>There is water on the quay and a simple shower and toilet block. Finikas has some small chandleries and yacht service companies (see harbour noticeboard for details).</p>
<p><span>It can get crowded in Finikas at the weekends as it is a charter base.</span></p>
