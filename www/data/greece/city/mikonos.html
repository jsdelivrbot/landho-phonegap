<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a low-lyong, rocky island to the east of Siros and SE of Tinos. It is a popular tourist island, mainly for its beaches, bars and its night life. The architecture of the town perfectly suits its situation and is a much photographed image of Greece. Inspite of the number of tourists, its winding alleys and cosmopolitan atmosphere create a very attractive port of call.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Mooring in the old harbour in front of the town is no longer permitted, and yachts must berth in the marina, about 2 miles north of the town. </p>
<p>The marina is still only partially completed.  Only some mooring line are in place and problems can be encountered when using an anchor. No electricity, although the (rusty) pillars are in place. Water and fuel delivered daily by truck. No official Harbour Master and nor are there any charges.</p>
<p>Be aware of strong gusts with Meltemi (up to F10!), normal winds in harbour are about 15-20 kn.</p>
