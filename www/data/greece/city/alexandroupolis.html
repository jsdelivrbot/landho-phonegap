<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Moor stern-to or alongside the north quay near the entrance to the inner harbour. If there is space, it is possible to moor in the inner basin itself. There is however limited room for visiting yachts and you may find yourself berthed on a commercial quay (dirty and noisy), or having to negotiate with the local fisherman to get a berth, neither of which are ideal. </span></p>
<p><span>The shelter is good (although in strong southerlies it can be lumpy) and the holding excellent.</span></p>
<p>There is shore power (although it's expensive) and water available here. As this is a commercial port, some repairs are possible and there are plenty of hardware shops.</p>
