<div class="hello"><div><p>The mountainous island of Karpathos has a port of the same name. Lyings midway between Rhodes and Crete, it is the most southerly of the islands in the Dodecanese. It is not much visited by tourists and has retained many traditional ways, including dress. Most of the inhabitants live in villages in the southern half of the island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of strong gusts when approaching this island. The Port of Karpathos (Pigadhia) is on the eastern side of the island.</p>
<p>Moor to the mole in the SW corner of the harbour. There is nearly always some surge here and many of the moored boats will have springs out.</p>
<p>Karpathos and Eastern Crete are affected by near gale or gale force winds from the north west a lot of the time. The many wind mills on the ridges and wind surfing resorts in Karpathos indicate the Greeks are well aware of this despite no mention of it in the cruising guides.</p>
