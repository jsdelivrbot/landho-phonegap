<div class="hello"><div><p>Ay. Nikolaos is located on the north east coast of Crete, <span style="text-align: justify; ">east of the island's capital </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">Heraklion and a </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">45 minute drive from </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">the Island's International Airport. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The town </span><span>can be seen from the north and east by a conspicuous white church on the summit of Nisis Ay Pantes and prominent buildings. It is a popular tourist resort, but still has a delightful old town.</span></p>
<p>Many yachts choose to winter here as there is a good boatyard and shore facilities and often winds are calmer during the winter months than they are in the summer.</p>
<p>Yachts should go directly to the marina and avoid the main harbour. Take care, as the marina entrance does have a tendancy to silt up. Normally there is a depth of at least 4m, but if in any doubt, call the marina on VHF Ch. 72 for assistance.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/greece-pics/crete_agio-nikolaos_marina/@@images/image/preview"/>Yachts can no longer berth in the old harbour and must use the marina on the southern side of the headland, Ak Mavros Kavos (maximum LOA 50m). The marina offers good shelter in all conditions, although in strong northerlies there does tend to be a surge inside the marina.</p>
<p>Berth where directed, picking up a tailed mooring line and proceeding bows/stern-to the quay. Depths from 3-8m.</p>
<p><span>The marina has all the usual services including laundry on site, travel hoist, lots of hardstanding, daily weather reports, chandlery, boat &amp; </span><span>sail repairs etc. </span><span>Close to the marina entrance is the beach with cafes &amp; restaurants and there are shops of all kinds within a few minutes walk. The local h</span><span>ospital is 200m away.</span></p>
