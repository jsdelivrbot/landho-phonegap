<p><strong>Skoinousa</strong><br/> The harbour/pier at Myrsini provides good shelter. There are bays on the southern side of the island which are good in northerlies.</p>
<p><strong>Iraklia</strong><br/> This island has a nice little harbour. Moor only on the inside pier. Be aware when the big ferries and watership come in.There is a good beach here and several possible anchorages.</p></div></div>
