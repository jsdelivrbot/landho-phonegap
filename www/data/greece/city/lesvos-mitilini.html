<div class="hello"><div><p>Lesvos is one of the largest Greek islands in the Aegean (after Crete and Evia) and the largest island of the Eastern Sporades.</p>
<p>It is green and fertile and less dependent on tourists than most of the other islands. That said, it is still one of the most popular islands as a tourist destination in this part of Greece.</p>
<p>It has two major sheltered natural harbours on its southern coast, Kolpos Kallonis to the SW and Kolpos Yeras to the SE, as well as the port of entry, Mitilini, on the SE coast. There are also ports at Mithimna (on the north coast) and Sigri (on the west coast).</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into our out of Greece see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities">Greek Formalities</a></strong><span>. This port is reported to very strict on clearance procedures.</span></p>
<p>Unless you are using an agent to clear in here, the authorities will want you to tie up at the ferry/Customs dock, <span>which is not suitable for yachts. It is very high and has black dirty tyres for fenders. If the dock is full with commercial vessels when you arrive, you will have to tie up on the town wall and wait to be called back (with your yacht) to the Customs dock for clearance (which could be late in the evening). </span></p>
<p><span>You are not permitted to walk over to Customs from the town wall, you must tie up at their dock for clearance, both in and out.</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to visit the Customs and Transit Log office, the Port Authority and the Passport Office.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs closes at 2100 and opens at 0730 most days, so if you have a dawn departure planned, take your boat to the Customs dock before 1800 the night before to process your departure for the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span>Last updated September 2015.</span></p>
<p><i><strong>Advice September 2016:</strong> Migrants still arrive regularly on Lesbos which can make clearing-in here rather hard work (see comments from 2015 at bottom of page). Docking is also restricted in the main harbour of Mitilini, however the situation is well under control and Lesvos still remains a beautiful island to visit. <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Chios" target="_blank"><strong>Chios</strong> </a>is a good alternative as a port of entry.</i></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/greece-pics/greece_lesvos_mytilini-town-quay_mv-leeze"/><strong>Mitilini (Mytilene)</strong></p>
<p>On entry through the breakwaters the marina lies to port, immediately north of the yacht club in the southern end of the harbour. The inner harbour and town quay can be found at the northern end of the harbour.</p>
<p><strong>Mitilini Inner Harbour</strong></p>
<p>At Mitilini, yachts can moor in the inner harbour on the North or East sides of the town quay, but beware of the soft mud which can allow some types of anchor to drag. Alongside mooring is permitted for short visits, med-moor for longer visits <i>(photo courtesy of MV LeeZe - July 2014)</i>. No assistance with line handling. Water and electricity available.</p>
<p>Note that the East quay is the quieter quay, away from traffic and bar noise, however reports received in September 2016 are that this quay is not currently available to visitors due to commercial/migrant traffic, and therefore the North quay is the only option.</p>
<p>To get water and electricity visit the associated office in the port area. Worth it if you are spending more than one night. See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Lesvos?rc=MarineServices#Water"><strong>Water</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p>Shelter is good, but to avoid the swell in strong southerlies, move to the SW corner of the harbour if there is space. This harbour can get very smelly as raw sewage empties into the harbour.</p>
<p>Fuel trucks are not permitted to come to the town quay, however there is a fuel station for jerry cans walking distance away.</p>
<p><strong>Mitilini Marina</strong></p>
<p>There is a SETUR marina in the southern corner of the outer harbour, just inside the western end of the detached breakwater. Cruisers report it offers a pleasant relief from the smelly, noisy harbour, and prices are reasonable. It is however quite a distance from the town centre. The marina has a fuel dock but does charge a night's stay for non-berth holders wanting fuel only.</p>
<p><span>The Tourist Office is open at the port, Monday to Friday from 0900 to approximately 1430. The two ladies inside can help with any enquiries re. port services (the Harbour Master will not assist with this).</span></p>
<p>Weather forecast (in English) is on VHF channel 01 at 0600/1000/1600/2200hrs UTC.</p>
<p><strong>Mithimna</strong></p>
<p>Located on the north coast of Lesvos, this delightful town with its winding narrow streets and castle on top of the hill, has an outer breakwater which offers good shelter. Go stern or bows-to in any available space, water and electricity available. Holding is poor so check your anchor carefully. The inner harbour has a very narrow entrance channel and is only suitable for very small yachts - shelter inside is excellent.</p>
<p><strong>Sigri</strong></p>
<p>On the remote western coast of Lesvos, Sigri is a typical Greek fishing village relatively untouched by tourists. There is a small quay here available to visiting yachts when no ferry is in town. Alternatively anchor in the bay south of the village. This offers good shelter from the Meltemi. Water is available on the quay.</p>
<p><strong>Kolpos Kalloni</strong></p>
<p>Take care with strong currents running in the narrow entrance to this large, landlocked gulf, on the south coast of Lesvos. Night entrance not recommended. With the Meltemi there can be very strong gusts into the gulf and an uncomfortable sea. There are numerous anchorages once inside and two possible places to tie to a dock: Skala Polikhnitos, a small harbour just east of the entrance; and Skala Kalloni at the head of the gulf.</p>
<p><strong>Plomari</strong></p>
<p>Further along the south coast, inbetween Kolpos Kalloni and Kolpos Yeras, lies the picturesque town of Plomari, famous for its "ouzo". There is space for visiting yachts on the N quay and water is available. Good shelter but not tenable in a southerly. Can be a surge here.</p>
<p><b>Kolpos Yeras</b></p>
<p>Lying about 25nm east of Kolpos Kalloni, this smaller landlocked gulf offers an easier entry with less effect from the Meltemi. Again, there a number of anchorages to choose from here with two places offering the possibility of tying up to a dock: Pirgos is a small fishing harbour on the western side of the entrance channel that may have space on its northern quay; and Perama a little further inside the channel.</p>
