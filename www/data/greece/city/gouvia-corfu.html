<div class="hello"><div><p>Kondokali, the village where Gouvia Marina is sited, was once a small fishing port. Situated 5nm NW of Corfu port it has now become a popular tourist resort, in particular with the English. Cruisers can easily find a good English pint, newspaper and breakfast here.</p>
<p>The marina is owned and managed by K&amp;G Med Marinas, who also operate Levkas, Kalamata, Zea Marinas. It is a popular charter/flotilla base and used as a winter base for many cruising boats.</p>
<p><span>When approaching from Corfu's northern channel the islet of Lazaretto is a landmark about a mile south of the entrance. </span></p>
<p><span>The channel is marked by 2 pairs of light buoys, with depths 8 to 9 meters in the middle. </span><span>These buoys are lit (range about 1 mile) but cannot always be relied on, so a night entry is not advisable. It is important to follow the marked channel carefully as there are extensive shallows on each side of it.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into our out of Greece see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities">Greek Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>During the summer (May to September), Gouvia marina can be used as a Port of Entry. The Officials are located on site, next to the marina office, and clearance is simple and straightforward and much easier than in Corfu town. All fees due to the Greek Authorities can be paid at the marina office. Open 0900-1430.</p>
<p><span>According to a ministerial directive which came into effect in September 2007, every boat over 7metres that enters Greece and is not permanently moored in the country, is obliged to pay a fee of 15€ each time they enter the country. The relative directive is valid all over Greece, however noonsite has only heard of Gouvia Port Police charging this "cruising permit" fee in 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>Outside of the summer months, it may be necessary to take a taxi to Corfu town to complete formalities.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Gouvia Marina is located in the SE corner of the closed bay of Gouvia (<span>Ormos Gouvion). </span>The marina is the only mooring option here as <span>anchoring is prohibited in the bay.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Gouvia marina is surrounded by a developed tourist area full of restaurants, bars and hotels within walking distance of the 2 entrances. The centre of Corfu town is about 7 km away with a regular bus service on the main road.</span></p>
<p>Moor stern/bows-to where directed by the berthing master and report to the office. Normally you will be met on arrival by a RIB and guided to your berth. Moorings are connected to the quay and a yacht's own anchor should not be used. In places where this is missing (as some of them are!), moor in the usual Mediterranean fashion. See marina website for current price list.</p>
<p>Shelter varies according to position within the marina. Berths on the west side and those to the east of the central pier are less comfortable in strong north easterlies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Anchoring</em></strong><br/> It is possible to anchor in Ormos Kammeno, just to the N of the harbour, in about 5-12m in mud and weed. It is sheltered in all winds except from the SE, but it is advisable to take a long line ashore if possible.</p>
