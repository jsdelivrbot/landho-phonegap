<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The local government runs a little jetty about 60 meters long with 2 sides and approx. 4.5m depth.</span></p>
<p>Water is at the beginning of the jetty, good quality but very warm.</p>
<p>Costs August 2014 for a 12m boat was 4€ per night. Mooring administrator reported to be very friendly with good English.</p>
<p><span>About eight restaurants are located directly on the waterfront, and yachts can moor in front of the restaurants for free, providing they dine in the restaurant. There is plenty of depth here to go stern-to the waterfront.</span></p>
<p>Near the harbour is a pebble beach good for swimming.</p>
<p>There is a mini-market 20 metres from the jetty, all provisions available.</p>
<p>Mosquitos at dusk and during the night are reported to be a problem here, so be sure to close hatches, cover up and use mosquito repellent.</p>
<p>Last updated August 2014.</p></div></div>
