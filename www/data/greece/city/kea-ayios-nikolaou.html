<div class="hello"><div><p>Kea is a fairly barren island in the Northern Cyclades about 12NM east of Sounion. There are several possible anchorages around the island, but the bay of Ay Nikolaos is the major settlement and only port.</p>
<p>The harbour of Ay Nikolaos (a series of connected bays) is located on the NW end of the Island. From the north the white village (or Chora) is easily spotted on the hill behind the bay, however the entrance is difficult to spot from a distance. As you get closer, you will see a small church (with light on top) on the north side of the entrance and a white church on the south side.</p>
<p>The village of Vourkari lies in the north eastern arm of the bay.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There are several anchorages in the bay and two quays; Vourkari in the NE corner and Korissia in the south. The holding is not good everywhere so care must be taken when setting the anchor.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Vourkari</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The pretty village of Vourkari can be crowded at times, particulary in the summer, with boats from Athens. Yachts can moor on the town quay, to starboard as you enter the bay. Alternatively, anchor off the beach behind the laid moorings in 8-12m.</span></p>
<p><span>The quay is very deep-to and holding is patchy in mud and weed, so be sure to lay out sufficient chain and test for holding before tying up to the quay. The prevailing wind will be blowing on to the quay. Water and electricity are available and the usual small markets and tavernas.</span></p>
<p><span>The chora on the hill can be reached by bus and the walk back to the harbour downhill is very pleasant. Another excursion worth doing is visiting the rock carving (a large lion with a face like a big cat dating from 600BC), just a 20 minute walk to the east of the village.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Korissia (Ormos Livadhi)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Again, the town quay is to starboard as you enter the bay, just past the small mole also to starboard. Watch out for shallow spots and rocks extending off the quay. Slightly more protected from the prevailing wind than Vourkari although there can be a little chop in here at times. It is also possible to anchor off the beach in the south of the bay, holding is patchy.</span></p>
<p><span>Water and electricity are available on the quay and there is a fuel station nearby. A mini-tanker can also deliver. Korissia has a few small supermarkets and plenty of tavernas.</span></p>
