<div class="hello"><div><p>Visitors should make for the yacht harbour, north of the harbour, where the the old caique basin has been converted into a marina. Berth where directed but beware of the shallows close to the quay.</p>
<p>The visitors' pontoon is subject to some swell. The minimum stay is 2 nights with discounts for longer stays. Water, electricity and shower facilities are included in the charge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if may be possible to moor stern-to or alongside on the northern side of the central mole (opposite the castle). Shelter is good but the wash from the constant movement of tugs and other workboats does cause a lot of surge. The holding is good.</p>
