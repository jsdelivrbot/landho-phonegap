<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two harbours at Port Thasos, the old harbour and the new port - Nea Limani - to the west. Both offer good protection.</p>
<p>The old harbour tends to be pretty full with local craft, all except the northern breakwater, suitable for smaller yachts. Most yachts however will probably have to anchor of with a long line ashore to avoid underwater rocks and get ashore by dinghy. There is water available on the quay.</p>
<p>Nea Limani (Limenias) to the west of the old harbour has berthing on both breakwaters. Most of the time alongside berthing, or rafting, is possible here. If busy, yachts can go stern or bows-to in the SE corner of the quay where power and water are available.</p>
