<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into our out of Greece see </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities">Greek Formalities</a></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>This is a Port of Entry and all necessary Authorities are here.</p>
<p><span>All yachts must now go to the Town Harbour to clear in, there is no longer an immigration office at the marina. Med moor bow or stern-to the town quay (this can be difficult with the Meltemi blowing as it will be on the beam). </span></p>
<p>The steps to clear in are; <br/><strong>1. Port Police/Immigration</strong> - at the Ferry Terminal at the side of the castle. Go around to the side of the building and be sure to tell them that you need passport control and you arrived on your own yacht. Otherwise, you will get the run around if they think you arrived by ferry (different window). <br/><strong>2. Customs</strong> - <span>on the street that follows the harbour by the big tree. Here you </span><span>will pay 30 euros for your transit log.<br/><strong>3. Harbourmaster </strong>- </span><span>on the same street as Customs further west at the traffic light. </span><span>Here you pay 10 euros and complete your clearing in process. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The port of Kos is at the eastern end of the island.</p>
<p><strong>The Old Harbour</strong> is well protected, but there can be a surge when a strong meltemi blows. Moor bows-to on the NE side of the harbour.</p>
<p>The holding is good but beware of an old mooring chain somewhere in the harbour! Electricity and water are both available but will require long connections. Toilets in the ferry terminal but no showers.</p>
<p><strong>The new marina</strong> is situated 1 mile SE of the Old Harbour of Kos. On arrival, take the boat's papers to the marina reception, which is in the middle of the complex, opposite pontoon D. Clearance can be done here during the summer season.</p>
<p>During the season the marina has large numbers of charter boats, but in the winter months there is plenty of space and it is a good place for live-aboards.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong><br/> In settled weather, there is an anchorage off the beach between the harbour and the marina.</p>
