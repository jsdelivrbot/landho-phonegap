<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care in the approaches to Piraeus, as it is very busy with ferries and commercial ships. Do not enter the commercial harbour.</p>
<p>The Zea marina entrance is to the south of it. A large number of the yachts here are permanent and mostly fill the inner harbour, advance reservations are recommended. The port office is situated at the east end of the quay designated for large yachts in the outer area of the harbour. The shelter is good, but an uncomfortable swell can develop in the outer harbour in strong southerlies.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the marina built for the 2004 Olympic games, Athens marina (previously called Faliro marina) offers good shelter and lies to just the east of Mounikhias. The Flisvos marina lies about a mile across the bay but has few visitors' berths. Yet another option is the marina currently being developed for the Tzitzifies Kallithea yacht club in the corner of the bay, just north of the entrance to Flisvos marina.</p>
<p>Another possibility is the private marina at Mounikhias, run by the Hellenic Yacht Club, but get prior permission before entering.</p>
<p>There is also the marina at Kalamaki, approximately two and a half miles south.</p>

This marina is made up of two harbour basins, the Internal harbour (Passalimani) and the External harbour (Freatida). Advance reservations recommended via online booking on website. Boats must call the marina on VHF channel 9 in advance of entry to receive instructions. The marina office can advise on arranging a wide rage of repairs and services. Water and electricity at each berth (not included in berthing fee). Showers, laundry, WiFi (not free), mail and fax services. Diesel can be delivered by mini-tanker. Whilst the marina has 24hr security (ie. a guard on the main gate) cruisers have reported that anyone can walk into the marina and thefts from boats were reported here in 2009.<br>
There is a crane on site, but it is not a suitable place to haul out. A busy, noisy, bustling place in close proximity to all city services, bars restaurants and shops. Fees are high.
