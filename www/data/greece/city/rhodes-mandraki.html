<div class="hello"><div><p>This, the largest of the islands in the Dodecanese, is a popular tourist destination. It is also a large charter base, so visiting mid-week provides a better chance of finding a berth. The main harbour for yachts is Mandraki on the north east tip of the island.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Rhodes town is very congested with crowds from cruise ships, ferries, holiday package groups, etc. and has thousands of shops and restaurants. Many cruisers prefer to moor in </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">Lindos and take the bus up to Rhodes for the day.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into our out of Greece see </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities">Greek Formalities</a></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>Yachts coming from other ports in Greece must complete formalities with the port police. If coming from outside Greece, Immigration and Customs must also be visited, both located at Mandraki Marina.</p>
<p>Port Police here have been reported as very officious, checking everything possible including the ship's logbook! They also insist on separate check in/check out even when planned stay is less than 12 hrs.</p>
<p>Customs and Immigration are at the root of the Ε mole in Mandrâki and the port police are on the W side.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Mandraki, Rhodes' yacht harbour, is usually full of local or charter yachts with little room for visitors. <span style="text-align: justify; ">Finding a berth between Friday and Monday is almost impossible once the season has begun as this is when the charter fleet are in port.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span>Some agents can help with securing berthing here in advance or you can try contacting the marina a week or so before you arrive to reserve. If possible, i<span style="text-align: justify; ">t's best to reserve a spot in advance and stick to your schedule as the harbour is very busy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">There is a chain that runs the length of the quay </span></span></span></span><span style="text-align: justify; ">about 30m off the sea wall. Therefore you will need to drop the anchor fairly far out. It</span><span style="text-align: justify; "> is recommended to use a tripping line as fouled anchors here are common.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">If no room can be found, or if you prefer a little more peace and quiet (and no problems with crossed anchors), you can anchor behind the windmills by the harbour wall, keeping clear of the channel into the commercial port.</span></p>
<p>The town quay is reserved for local ferries and hydrofoils.</p>
<p>The moorings on the E side are private. All berths are allocated to charter boats and vsitors are discouraged from berthing here. The pontoon on the W side of the harbour has now been removed.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage about 1nm SE of the harbour, close to the old city and a small boatyard. Take a line to one of the big blocks lying along the east side. Fouled anchors are a common occurrence simply because there are so many yachts. Divers are at the skippers' expense.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="../../greece-pics/greece_rhodes_new-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>The new marina (<i>see photo taken August 2015</i>) is now open with berths available - see latest updates in comments at bottom of page. It is still under construction however and services are limited. It is 1 mile away from the town in a quiet area with no bus service available. Across the road from the marina is a <span>chandlery, a bakery and a restaurant. There is a small supermarket about a 5 minute walk away and a larger Lidl supermarket about 3km away.</span></p>
