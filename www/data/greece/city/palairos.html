<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour is crowded in the summer with charter yachts and the pontoon here tends to be completely full, especially at weekends. You may have better luck finding a berth during the week.</p>
<p><span>The western quay is available for visiting yachts and there are a few water taps here too.</span></p>
<p>The harbour provides good shelter.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use the charter boat base of Vounaki marina, just south of the town.</p>
