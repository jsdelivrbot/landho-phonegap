<div class="hello"><div><p>Like Skiathos, this is an attractive pine covered island, famous for its citrus fruit and plums. The main ports are Limin Skopelou (the capital) on the east coast and Loutraki on the west coast, however outside the main towns there is very little concession to tourism and this island can still feel pretty isolated.</p>
<p>That said, the well known 2008 film "Mamma Mia!" was filmed here, so you may find that the lovely deserted bay you are anchored in is now on the Mamma Mia tour boat itinerary.</p>
<p>Whilst this island has become a very popular tourist destination in recent years, Skopelos town still retains its Greek charm and is a relaxing place to visit.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Limin Skopelou (Skopelos)</strong><br/>With strong NE winds, sea conditions can make this harbour dangerous to enter. Moor stern/bows-to on the north quay, taking care not to snag the harbour chain lying on the bottom about 30m from the wall. There is space for a good number of yachts here and there are some laid moorings available.</p>
<p><span>Note that boats on the first 200 meters of the north pier get sprayed with saltwater in strong northerly winds, force 5 and over.</span></p>
<p>Now that the new, high, harbour wall is complete, shelter here has improved. However, with a strong Meltemi it can get very rough in the harbour so be sure to keep some distance off the quay. It's not dangerous, but can be uncomfortable. <span>The holding is very good in the mud.</span></p>
<p>This harbour now has automatic service poles for water and electricity on the outer quay (16 amps). <span>Sticks are available in the harbour kiosk at the foot of the small pier and in the first restaurant from the north pier.</span></p>
<p><span>Fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker (Tel: 24240 34049).</span></p>
<p><span>Car and passenger ferries, slow and fast (Flying Dolphins and Fast Cats), run to Volos, Alonnisos, Skyros, Skiathos, Evia and the mainland Agios Konstantinos. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Loutraki </strong><br/>Situated on the NW corner of the island the harbour can easily be spotted by the village on the hill above it. This harbour is busy with hydrofoils and ferries. In strong southerly winds the harbour may become untenable.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a pontoon for yachts installed in the NE corner of the harbour for the summer months and removed in the winter. The north side of the pontoon can be shallow. <span>The pontoon has automatic electric and water service poles. Buy a stick to activate the service from the charter office 100m from the pontoon. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, anchor fore and aft and take a long line ashore to the wall on the SE side of the harbour. Or free swing in the south of the harbour away from the ferry turning area.</span></p>
<p><span>The town is good for provisioning, with plenty of tavernas. There is a bus to Skopelos town and a ferry to neighbouring Skiathos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Klima</strong></p>
<p>Just south of Loutraki, this harbour has been expanded and yachts can moor along the NW quay. There is water and electricity and fuel by mini-tanker can be arranged. Again, not a safe haven in southerly winds.</p>
<p><strong>Other Harbours/Anchorages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Panormou</strong>, midway down the west coast, is a large, deep bay. On its south side is an inlet with much better shelter. Anchor fore and aft on the western side of the inlet and take a long line ashore. Quite often katabatic winds will blow down into the inlet at night, beam onto the yachts at anchor, so make sure your anchor is well set. This is a popular spot.</p>
