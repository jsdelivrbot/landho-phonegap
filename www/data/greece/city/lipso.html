<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several options for berthing here. The inner harbour has been dredged to 3 to 5m but the holding is bad in a mixture of sand, mud and weed.</p>
<p>There is a pontoon in the NW corner and also, maybe, room off the new quay on the SE side, near the water boat.</p>
<p>In strong <code>meltemis</code>, anchoring in the southern part of the bay in 3 to 4m is a more sheltered option. Also, the northside of the entrance to the bay, by the chapel, offers good shelter.</p>
