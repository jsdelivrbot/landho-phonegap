<p>Often referred to as the Greek "Gibraltar", the island of Monemvasia is connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway 200m in length. It's village - Yefira - is located on the mainland.</p>
<p>The old fortified village is Byzantine in origin, but was re-built by the Venetians. Many of the old Medieval buildings have been restored and overall it is a charming place, as is the church of Ayis Sofia at the very top of the hill. You will be rewarded with incredible views.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/080bd4d6314446e2b18a05fbbde90d90/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina is located to the south of Monemvasia island and causeway (see photo). It can be difficult to spot the marina breakwater.</p>
<p>Once around the breakwater yachts can berth stern or bows-to the mole at the entrance of the harbour (which extends eastwards). Watch out for boulders off the harbour side of this mole extending into the entrance, it can get shallow and yachts regularly go aground here.</p>
<p>There may be space futher inside the harbour on the southern quay, or alongside the breakwater.</p>
<p>The harbour offers good shelter although in with a strong N/NE wind there can be quite a surge. Water and electricity available at some sections of the quay.</p>
<p>Alternatively, yachts can sometimes find space on the northern side of the causeway on the inside of the ferry quay. This offers good shelter from southerlies but can be rolly with the NE Meltemi, so be sure to hang plenty of fenders.</p>
<p>Yachts wishing to anchor should try to anchor just south of the causeway, as close to the fishing harbour as possible. The bottom is mud, rocks and weed and holding can be patchy.</p>
