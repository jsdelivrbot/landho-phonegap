<div class="hello"><div><p>Thira (more commonly known as Santorini) is one of the most southerly of the  Cyclades islands and lies approximately 150nm SE from Athens.</p>
<p>This island is like no other in Greece, being the remnants of a massive volcanic  eruption in about 1450. Viewing the sunset from one of the towns on top of the  island is a must! The island is a major holiday destination and Thira town is  crowded with cruise ship passengers and "beautiful" people. Prices are high,  however, it should not be missed.</p>
<p>A yellow buoy marks the extremity of the reef running out from the headland. On  approach keep this to starboard. Dredging in the outer basin and the  entrance maintains depths at a minimum of 2-3m. Silting tends to occur during winter storms, so approach with care if coming here early in the season.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> There are several anchorages around the island, but none are particularly safe  and a yacht should not be left unattended in any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Berthing</strong><br/> There is a small fishing harbour at Vlikadha, on the southern side of the  island. This is available to yachts, however it is extensively used by day  tripper and local boats. The tripper catamarans come and go twice a day. Try to  avoid arriving at 09:30 - 10:30, 14:45 - 15:45 and around sunset, as these are  the busy times, with as many as 10 tripper boats jockeying for position.</p>
<p>Berths are usually allocated on the outer side of the outer quays, however be  prepared to raft up, sometimes up to three deep.</p>
<p>The marina is reported to be very dusty, but is convenient with local buses  running from the marina car park to Thira town.</p>
<p>Another option for visiting this popular island, is to go to Ios and take a  ferry.</p>
