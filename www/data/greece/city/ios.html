<div class="hello"><div><p>The port of Ios is on the west coast of the island, opposite the northern end of Sikinos, 3.5 NM away.</p>
<p>Moor to the quay, but use plenty of fenders and keep well out as the ferries arrive at speed and create a lot of surge. The port police supervise the yacht moorings on the N quay in the evenings. The yellow buoy marks the mooring chain. Holding is good in mud.</p>
<p>Anchoring in the bay is prohibited due to the many fast ferries serving the island.</p>
