<div class="hello"><div><p>Kiato is situated on the Gulf of Corinth, near the mouth of the river Asopos a<span>bout 12NM NW of Corinth</span><span>. The ancient city </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicyon" title="Sicyon"><b>Sicyon</b></a><span> was located 4 km southwest of present Kiato.</span></p>
<p>Although mainly a commercial harbour, recent extensions to the harbour walls have made this tourist town more attractive as a stopping place for yachts. <span>There is a small harbour here, with bus and rail to Athens and Patras, and </span><span>good beaches.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Small protected harbour from prevailing NW winds (but not protected from the East). Mooring stern-to, approx. 3m depth. Bottom is littered with local moorings, so take car when dropping and hauling up your anchor.</p>
<p>Drinking water available, but no electricity. Good illumination at night.</p>
<p>If no space available in small harbour, yachts can moor inside the large breakwater.</p>
<p>Good shopping in town (800m from the outer breakwater there is a LIDL supermarket) and ATMs. In front of the LIDL is also a little harbour, so one can anchor and go by dinghy to the supermarket.</p>
