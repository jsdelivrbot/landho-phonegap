<div class="hello"><div><p>Poros Harbour provides excellent year round shelter but there is an almost constant wash caused by the traffic of large and small ferries. The town is built on a small peninsula surrounded by a quay. Visiting yachts use the North Quay while the South Quay is used by the ferries and resident flotilla.</p>
<p>A pontoon extending at right angles from the quayside and the <span>renovated</span> quay now allows much more space for visiting boats than previously.</p>
<p>Anchor at 10m and come stern-to the quay but allow long stern lines to protect the boat from the swells caused by the wakes. The bottom is mud and provides very good holding. The harbour can be quite crowded an there is always a good chance that your anchor will be fouled by another boat so be prepared for this during departure.</p>
<p>Warning - be aware of the wake of the constant coming and going at high speed of the ferries. Leave as much distance between your stern and the concrete quay as possible. It is very shallow in the channel between the island and the mainland - keep to the island side.</p>
<p>Good anchorages nearby at Monastery Bay and Russian Bay.</p>
