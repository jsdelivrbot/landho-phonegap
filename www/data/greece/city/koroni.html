<div class="hello"><div><p>Known as <i>Corone</i> by the Venetians and Ottomans, the town of Koroni sits on the southwest peninsula of the Peloponnese on the Gulf of Messinia in southern Greece.</p>
<p>The impressive Venetian castle houses part of this attractive town which livens up at night.</p>
<p>Works to the breakwater here are on-going.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../greece-pics/greece_pelop_koroni/@@images/image/preview"/>The town quay in general is too shallow for docking<i> (photo courtesy of SY <span>DeDanann who visited here in 2016)</span></i> however there may be space right at the end of the NE breakwater.</p>
<p>Failing that, yachts must anchor off the beach where holding is good (in mud). Take care close to the breakwater where there are many stray boulders.</p>
<p><span>There is good shelter here from the prevailing wind.</span></p>
<p><span>In settled weather a picturesque spot to drop the hook is just below the castle walls on the eastern side of the harbour breakwater. Note that improvement works to the breakwater are on-going.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently there is no water or fuel available to cruisers.</span></p>
