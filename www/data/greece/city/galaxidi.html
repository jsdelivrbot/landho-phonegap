<div class="hello"><div><p>The town has recently had its old town quay upgraded and water and electricity points installed (included in mooring fee - see above). There are no laid moorings.</p>
<p><span>Andreas will assist with mooring at the quay and will try to sell you diesel (BP). He is reported to be very helpful with mooring and also connects the waterhose and electricity.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker. (call Grivas Fottos +30.22650.42250; +30.6977.682576; +30.6936.950716).</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, there is a good anchorage in the northern bay in 3m over sand.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>There is a mini-market on the harbour front amongst all the restaurants and a post office and </span><span>ATM in the village. Greek gas can also be found in the village.</span></p>
<p><span>The bus to Itea, goes on to Delphi. </span><span>Note: The last bus leaves from Itea to Galaxidi at 21:00. Much cheaper choice than taking a taxi.</span></p>
