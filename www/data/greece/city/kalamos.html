<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor stern-to on the E breakwater, or, if there is room, use one on the moorings on the quay by the mole on the western side. The harbour is generally sheltered from the prevailing winds and the holding is good in mud and sand.</p>
<p>In 2009 there were a number of indiscriminate thefts from charter boats and private boats at nearby Mitikas, 4 miles north on the mainland. However, Kalamos is reported to be safe and the harbour is policed well by the local taverna people who are very helpful and always direct you to a berth.</p>
