<div class="hello"><div><p>This small city was once an important port, but as shipping activity diminished and together with the effects of earthquakes, parts of it now have a rather abandoned air. However, reconstruction is taking place and the friendly marina makes it a pleasant place to visit.</p>
<p>Kalamata is famous for its delicious fat, black olives,</p>
<p>It is a convenient port from which to visit Messene, and for crew changes with good connections to Athens.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/9d1bc0feac6a4a6b802279fe62aab6da/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina is located to the West of the commercial harbour. All yachts should head to the marina.</p>
<p>The marina entrance can be difficult in strong southerlies as it is rather narrow. Berth where directed.</p>
<p>The shelter here is excellent although southerly gales can cause a surge at the berths closest to the entrance. Be sure to pull the boat well off the quay.</p>

<p><span><strong>Limeni</strong><br/>Two hours south of Kalamata, this is a good anchorage with good holding, although should be avoided in westerlies (see comment at bottom of page). There is space for five yachts on the little pier going stern to (if fishing boats haven't taken up all the space), keeping a couple of meters off. There is a local taverna and basic provisions available. </span></p>
