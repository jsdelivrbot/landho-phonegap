<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several ports worth visiting, in addition to many anchorages.</p>
<p><strong>Frikes</strong> <br/>This picturesque little harbour is on the east coast of the northern island. Yachts berth alongside the small quay and are expected to raft up. Strong southerly winds can cause a problem, but otherwise it is a safe harbour. Water and electricity on the quay.</p>
<p><strong>Kioni</strong> <br/>This little harbour is about 4NM South of Frikes in another deep bay. It is subject to the same problems in strong southerlies. No water and limited provisions, but very charming.</p>
<p><strong>Vathi</strong> <br/>This Vathi (not to be confused with the one on Samos) is tucked into a bay on the northern coast of the southern island. During the day, the prevailing wind blows into the bay and can make berthing on the town quay difficult, but generally it dies away at night. No swell or surge enters here, however the cross wind can be fierce at times, keep a good distance from the quay. <span>The anchorage is excellent with great holding in 5m of water. Yachts often use the ferry quay for berthing as well, however it helps to know the ferry schedule which is intermittent. </span></p>
<p>Water (<span>10€ for 100 liters approx.) </span>and fuel can be delivered here by mini-tanker. Be sure to double check price and quantity before paying. Good provisions and an excellent bakery. Limited repairs. For latest updates from cruisers visiting Vathi <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2008-10-05-1">read this report</a>.</strong></p>
