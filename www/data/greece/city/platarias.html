<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth stern-to on the southern breakwater. There is also an anchorage off the beach. Try to find a place in the southern part of the harbour. There is water and electricity, cost per day for water €3 - limitless, €3 for elec. plus €3 for your boat. Very good holding in mud.</p>
<p>Good shelter from the prevailing wind.</p>
<p>As with most town quays, rats can be a problem here, so it is important to take the necessary precautions with any mooring lines.</p>
