<div class="hello"><div><p>Nisos Zakinthos (Zante Island) lies south of Cephalonia just off the coast of the Peloponnese and is a most attractive island. Sadly, much of the Italian architecture which made it such a jewel, was destroyed in the 1953 earthquake.</p>
<p>The port of Zakynthos (Port Zante) is towards the southern end of the east coast. This is a good place for shopping and re-provisioning, however has little else going for it and can be very noisy in the Summer.</p>
<p>Beware of the unlit buoys marking the end of a pipeline SE of the harbour entrance.</p>

<p><strong>Zakinthos National Marine Park - <a class="external-link" href="http://www.nmp-zak.org/">www.nmp-zak.org</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The National Marine Park of Zakynthos was founded in 1999, and is located in Laganas bay, SE of Zakynthos. This is the most important nesting area for the loggerhead sea turtle in the Mediterranean. Restrictions for vessels anchoring here are in place from May to November every year, however if wanting to visit at any time of the year it's advisable to enquire with local authorities at Port Zante before heading there. Fines have been given to yachts that infringe the regulations.</span></p></div></div>

<p><strong>Port Zakinthos</strong><br/><i>37°46′.69N, 20°54′.36E</i> <br/> There is now a small, protected marina here - Port Zante Marina, situated in the heart of the city, which makes it very convenient. In the summer however, the marina does tend to fill up with day tripper boats so town quay space is more readily available. Cruisers advise that the best way to secure a berth is to first dinghy into the marina and talk face to face with the marina staff. Avoid taking the boat in on the off chance, as it is likely they will tell you to turn around and leave. In summer, contact them in advance. <i>(photo of Zakinthos from Fabian Eder)</i></p>
<p>On the town quay, yachts can berth stern-to or bows-to the NE or NW quays - where directed. Wash can be a problem here, so be sure to pull yourself a good distance off the quay and make sure your anchor is well dug in.</p>
<p>This harbour is less safe in the winter as strong southerly winds create a swell, even inside the harbour.</p>
<p><span>The holding is good in this harbour and the most comfortable place to be is in the NE corner clear of the ferry turning area. In the summer, the large tripper boats that occupy the NE quay move into the marina leaving a little more space for visiting boats. This quay has water and electricity.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The NW quay has good depth at its northern part, but is neither comfortable nor safe in a strong southerly.</span></p>
<p>Anchoring in the harbour is not permitted.</p>
<p>There are fuel stations around the harbour or it can be delivered by mini-tanker.</p>
<p>As with most town quays, rats can be a problem here, so it is important to take the necessary precautions with any mooring lines. Be sure to secure your yacht properly if leaving it for any length of time.</p>
<p><strong>Port Security<br/><i>Security levels at ports have been raised when cruise ships are in port due to terrorism concerns.</i></strong><span> <br/></span><span>In Zante this is a problem as the Hellenic Coastguard close down the whole port limiting permitted traffic to that of ferries and cruise ship passengers only. You will not be allowed to enter or leave the port whilst the cruise ship is in port (approx. 0900-1700) and will not be given any advance warning.</span><span> It is recommended to enquire on arrival if a cruise ship is expected, so you can plan accordingly.</span></p>
<p><strong>Docking/Anchoring elsewhere on Zante Island</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Ormos Ay Nikolaos <br/></i></strong><span><i>37°54′.33N, 20°42′.57E</i></span><br/>A bay on the northern tip of Zante with some shelter provided by the off-lying islet of Ay Nikolaos. There are two quays here, one on the south side of the bay and the ferry quay in the north. Lay plenty of chain as depths drop off quickly. It can get quite uncomfortable here on the quay when it's full of day-tripper boats and any swell enters the bay, and untenable with strong winds from the NE. Moving and anchoring <span>SW of islet Ay Nikolaos approx. 50m from shore, can be more comfortable. Dimitri also has a quay (opposite the petrol station). He offers free mooring with water (and electricity if needed) on the understanding that dinner is taken in his taverna.</span> There are plenty of tavernas here and a mini-market.</p>
<p><strong><i>Alykanas<br/></i></strong><span><span><i>37°50′.68N, 20°46′.83E</i></span><br/>Yachts can anchor off the beach outside the swimming area in Alykanas, located on the NE coast of Zante. This is a useful spot to anchor if wanting to head around to "Wreck Bay" the following morning.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Kavos </i></strong><br/><span><i>37°50′.41N, 20°49′.18E</i></span><br/>Also on th NE coast, this small fishing harbour is only suitable for smaller yachts drawing less than 1.5m. If space can be found this is a very sheltered spot.</p>
<p><strong>Ormos Vroma</strong><br/><span><i>37°49′.02N, 20°38′.03E</i></span><br/>This is a spectacular deep inlet on the NW coast of Zante, just south of the much-photographed "Wreck Bay". In settled weather it is possible to overnight here, but take care with the strong Katabatic winds that blast down the mountainside and the very deep water. A line ashore is recommended and holding can be poor in places. In strong southerlies this bay is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>"Wreck Bay"</strong><br/>It is advisable to try and arrive here early in the morning and anchor close to the west side of the bay, clear of the bulk of day-tripper boats.</p>
<p><i>There are some beautiful anchorages on Zante, but watch out for Katabatic gusts, restrictions according to the National Marine Park and day tripper boats.</i></p>
