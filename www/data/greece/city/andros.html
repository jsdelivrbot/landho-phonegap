<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Gavrion</b> offeres the safest anchorage on Andros when tucked into the northern corner of the bay and the holding is good. There may be room to moor to the quay between the ferry piers.</p>
<p><b>Kastro</b> (Chora) is more exposed to the <em>Meltemi,</em> but is reasonably sheltered in the inner harbour. This has now been expanded and there is room for quite a few yachts behind the mole. The holding is poor however in the rock and weed. The village is worth the effort to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Batsi</strong> is now a mooring option as the mole has been extended and there is room for 10-12 yachts.</p>
