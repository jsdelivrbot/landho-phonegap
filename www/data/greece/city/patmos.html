<div class="hello"><div><p>This rather barren island, consisting of three volcanic hills, is the most northerly island of all the Dodecanese.</p>
<p>The natural harbour of Skala Patmos lies on the eastern side of the island on the eastern side of the central isthmus. It is overseen to the north by the chora of Patmos (the old town) which is topped with the monastery of St. John the Divine.</p>
<p>Easter is a wonderful time to visit Patmos as next to Mt. Athos, Patmos is a major spiritual centre for the Greek Orthodox Church with students from all over Greece attending the theological college here.</p>
<p>There is a boatyard here and daily ferries to Piraeus and Rhodes, Kos and Samos.</p>
<p>Position 37° 19'20"N, 26° 32'60"E (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Yacht Quay ("Marina")</strong></p>
<p><span>Upon entering the bay, contact the Port Authority on VHF Channel 12. </span><span>They will direct you to berth at the "marina" (yacht quay) located in the NW corner of the bay </span><span>on the western side of the harbour. Moor stern-to using your own anchor. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Shore power is only available on the southern half of this quay. </span></p>
<p><span>Once berthed, find the yacht quay management company (in 2016 this was <span>Astoria Travel located in a white hut at the southern end of the yacht quay).</span></span></p>
<p><span>They can organise electricity which is pre-paid with a minimum amount of 10€ permitted (approx. 11 Kw). You will need to ask for a receipt. </span><span>Water is delivered by mini-tanker and costs approx. <span>10€/ton.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><i>Note:</i></strong> <span>The northern part of the quay does get used for some commercial traffic, in particular a 78m long fuel ship which visits 3 to 4 times during the summer months to refuel the local electric station located across the street from the yacht quay. Very little warning is given to yacths that need to move to make space, and if no one is on board the authorities will move yachts themselves. It advisable to try and find space in the southern section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Other Quay Space</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Should the "marina" be full, yachts can try and find space in the small <span>squarish basin on the NE side of the harbour. Depths of 3m, but no electricity and water. The ferry dock on the starboard side to the south of this basin can also be used if waiting for a spot on the quay. Both these docks are <span>managed by the fishing co-operative who may or may not charge overnight fees.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Shelter is good except in strong winds from the SE which can make this harbour untenable. The bottom is sand, mud and weed and holding is good.</p>
<p>The walk into town is along a main road with limited pavement for pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor near the head of the bay in about 8m and this offers good shelter from the "Meltemi", however space here is very restricted.</p>
<p><span>There are numerous anchorages around Patmos in addition to the port at Skala Patmos.</span></p>
