<div class="hello"><div><p>Volos is one of the largest commercial ports in Greece, and is, therefore, very busy with cargo boats. The city is bustling and varied with all the resources a yacht could wish for in provisions and repairs. The harbour front is traffic-free and the evening "passagario" is very popular with the locals and visitors 
alike. Fish can be bought directly from a number of the local boats in 
the mornings.</p>
<p>Position 39°21.1'N, 22°56.19'E.</p>

<p>This is a port of entry. All the authorities are based here as it is a major commercial and ferry port. the <span>Port Police do not visit visiting yachts as they are busy with the comercial ships and ferries, so you are obliged to go by yourself to their office.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/greece-pics/greece_volos_harbour-map_syfunnygirl/@@images/image/preview"/>Yachts can moor where indicated on the map by the green coloured lines (our thanks to SY Funny Girl for the map). </span><span>There are alot of local boats and charter boats everywhere in this harbour, however normally a space can be found. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The Southern breakwater has laid lines and is often the only place to find a space for visiting yachts, however this is a poplular place for local youths to congregate so can get noisy and security is questionable. <span>In addition, how often the laid lines are checked is dubious, so you may be better off using your own anchor. Water is available here.</span></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The eastern town quay can be used however this part of the harbour is subject to swell from the ferries. Water and electricity are available.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Anchor stern-to. Holding is good, although some parts of the harbour have rather soft mud.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The "yacht harbour" in the north is normally full of fishing boats. If you do find a space here, it is still close to the town and restaurants and there is no swell at all. Water and electricity are available.</span></p>
<p>The closest roadside petrol station for fuel is marked red on the map. There is also drinking water available here.</p>
<p>An Irish/Italian called Carlos acts as an unofficial "Harbourmaster" and will direct you to a berth. He has excellent local knowledge and is very helpful.</p>
<p>The Yellow Pin on the map in the SW corner of the bay marks the Pafkakia boatyard.<span> There is also a concrete wall/quay here where a yacht can moor.</span></p>
