<div class="hello"><div><p>Pilos guards the entrance to the enclosed Bay of Navarinon, which was the site of an important naval battle in the Greek war of Independence in 1827.</p>
<p>It is located on the south west coast of the Peloponnese and is easily identified by the large natural rock arch and lighthouse on N. Pilos marking the entrance to Navarinon Bay and the large Venetian Fort to the south of the town. Take care in strong westerly winds as the sea can build up at the entrance to the bay.</p>
<p><span>Largely built by the French in the 19th Century, Pilos has the feel of a provincial French town and is a good place from which to organise a visit to ancient Pilos.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 36° 55'11"N, 21° 42'04"E (marina entrance)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/79e738af6415414e85ba691b423f8749/@@images/image/preview"/>Keep a good lookout for the many large ships which use this bay.</p>
<p><b>Marina Berthing</b></p>
<p>A new marina has been built to the NE of the town quay<i> (see photo courtesy of SY <span>DeDanann who visited in 2016)</span></i>, however latest reports are that this was never finished and now lies in a rather abandoned state. It also tends to be full of local boats so finding space here may be difficult.</p>
<p><span>Beware of the shallows to the south of the approaches to the marina entrance. Head directly</span><span> for the cliffs before turning sharp to starboard and through the marina entrance. This can be tricky in strong winds. </span></p>
<p>Berth stern-to or alongside in depths of 2.5-3.5m. There is very good shelter inside, although berths near the entrance can be subject to swell rebounding from the cliffs. One w<span>ater tap available in a limited area on the east side of the marina. It is possible to arrange a fuel delivery. See <a href="Countries/Greece/Pilos?rc=MarineServices#Fuel"><strong>Fuel section</strong></a>. No other facilities.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>It is a short walk into town from the marina.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Town Quay</b></span></p>
<p><span>Some cruisers have reported that the town quay is too shallow for berthing, however <span> there are two abandoned fuel barges lying on the western breakwater that yachts can tie up to if space is tight. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Others however have managed to berth at the town quay with no problem. There does not appear to be a berthing charge here and water is available for free via a tap and long hose.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Anchoring</b></span></span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring is possible at the northern end of Ormos Navarinou. The bottom rises steeply to the beach so anchoring depths will be between 8-12m. The prevailing wind tends to blow from the N/NW, so there is good shelter here and good holding. There are few facilities at this end of the bay, although during the summer months there are snack bars open at Yialova in the north eastern part of the bay.</span></p>
