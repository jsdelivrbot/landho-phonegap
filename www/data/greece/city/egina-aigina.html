<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care on aproaching the harbour entrance as it is very busy with ferries and hydrofoils entering and leavings at high speed.</p>
<p>Moor to the town quay or in the marina. If moored in the harbour, ensure the anchor is well embedded as there is considerable wash from the ferries. Avoiding the weekends might be advisable, making it easier to obtain a berth here.</p>
<p>Good shelter, although strong southerlies can cause some swell.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in 3mt over sand and weed patches south of the marina and main harbour. The dinghy can be landed in the eastern corner of the marina, where you can tie it up next to the small fishing boats.</p>
