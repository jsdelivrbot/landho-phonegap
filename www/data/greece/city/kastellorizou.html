<div class="hello"><div><p>Nisos Kastellorizon (Kastellorizou/Castellorizon/Kastelorizo) is a small rocky island lying a mere 2 miles south of the Turkish mainland, across from the Turkish port of Kas and about 70NM east of Rhodes; it is the most Easterly Greek outpost.</p>
<p>The harbour and town is “picture-perfect” attractive and very welcoming for visiting yachts. Behind the town, a hiking path with 400 steps leads up the mountain and the effort will reward you with breath-taking views, not only of the Kastelorizo town and harbour, but also of the Turkish mainland across the water. Venturing a little further up the rocky path to the top of the mountain brings you to a centuries-old monastery.</p>
<p>The town around the harbour was heavily bombed during WW1 after which many of the 2000 occupants left for Australia - some of the houses behind the waterfront are still in ruin - and only approx. 200 people remain today. The 1991 Oscar winning movie for foreign language, "Mediterraneo", made the island popular.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities">Greek Formalities</a></strong> for full details including Fees for clearing into Greece.</p>
<p>This is a Port of Entry and all the necessary Authorities are based here, conveniently <span>within a 3 minute walk of the docking area, just north of the ferry dock.</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the islands proximity to Turkey, Immigration/Customs may visit the boat to check for illegal immigrants as this can be a problem in this area. Don't be tempted to pop across from Turkey, anchor and go ashore in the dinghy without clearing in. Always</span><span> inform the Port Police on VHF Ch.12 of your arrival. If you go ashore - you must clear in. Clearance fees still need to be paid, even if it's just a quick visit.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Re. Clearance Agents:</strong> For private vessels the use of an agent for clearance is optional. However, for commercial vessels (rentals, charters etc.) it is mandatory. <br/>Cruisers have recommended using an agent if you have<span> </span><strong>specific</strong><span> clearance </span><span>issues </span></span><span>that require "flexibility" from the Greek authorities </span><span>(such as not following the exit procedures from Turkey).</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The port of Kastelorizo is located at the northern end of the Island and subject to considerable swell in strong north easterlies or when a strong meltemi blows. Approaching from the north west is fairly straight forward; the approach from the south east is littered with rocky outcrops and small islands, and should not be attempted during hours of darkness.</p>
<p>To the east of the natural harbour of Kastelorizo is Mandraki, suitable for anchoring in settled weather only and becomes very shallow close to shore.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/greece-pics/greece_kastelorizo_aerial-view/@@images/image/preview"/>The main harbour of Kastelorizo (<i>see photo courtesy of SY Big Sky</i>) has good depth east of the short stubby pier in the south east corner. The bottom is mud and rocks so holding can be patchy. This quay is also very low which can make getting on and off the boat quite difficult if bows-to.</p>
<p>To the west of this pier and all along the west side of the harbour, depths vary with rocks in some places; special care is needed and in general bow-to docking might be preferable. Cruisers have found good holding on the eastern side of the harbour, although this side is occupied with local fishing and tour boats and is also where the ferry docks. Yachts can moor on the ferry dock overnight, but must leave early before the ferry arrives.</p>
<p>Free-swinging in the harbour is best avoided so as not to block the commercial traffic.</p>
<p>Facilities ashore include a supermarket and a few small stores, a bakery, an ATM and numerous restaurants and bars, many offering free WiFi. Some might offer power and water (although this is scarce on the island), with toilets behind the Athena restaurant.</p>
<p><span>Port fees in Kastelorizo are paid exclusively to the </span><span>harbour management </span><span>agency. </span><span>The port fee depends on the length of the vessel and length of stay. </span><span>For 2016 they are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>7-10m: 150€ x length in m x days/365</span></p>
<p><span>10-15m: 170€ x length in m x days/365</span></p>
<p><span>15m &gt; : 200€ x length in m x days/365. </span></p>
