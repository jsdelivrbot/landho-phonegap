This is clearly visible on the Cape from a distance and is easily reached after a short walk.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor in 5m in the NW corner just below a small chapel where the bottom is sandy. Take care as alot of the bay is weed with poor holding. Make sure the anchor is well dug in as the bay is subject to severe gusts and dragging is common. Beware of some unmarked rocks on the eastern side.</p>
<p>The best time to visit the temple is in the early morning, before the day-trippers arrive. The young Byron is said to have carved his name on one of the columns.</p>
<p>There is a taverna and hotel ashore with a small wooden dock suitable for dinghies.</p>
<p><strong>Gaidouronisa Island, off Cape Sounion</strong><br/> A reasonable alternative to the Sounion anchorage in SW winds, but a bit rolly due to the swell created by passing power boats. Anchor between the fish farm and the beach in 10m over sand.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Lavrion?rc=PortProfile">Lavrion</a></strong><br/> If wishing to spend longer exploring this peninsula, then the Olympic Marina at Lavrion is a secure and comfortable place to leave the boat. It is approximately 5nm north of Sounion.</p>
