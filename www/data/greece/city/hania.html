<div class="hello"><div><p>Also known as Khania, this was originally the capital of Crete. The old Venetian city around the harbour is a fascinating place to explore and it has only very recently become popular with tourists.</p>
<p>Take care as the harbour entrance can become quite dangerous in strong onshore winds with rough seas. The detached breakwater just off the entrance is only just visible above the waves.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>On approach contact the local Coast Guard to check for berth availability. See the comment below re. entering this harbour at night. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The harbour is to port after passing the breakwater. Transit berths are available in the inner harbour on the starboard side (southern quay). It's possible to berth alongside (in quieter months) or Med style with laid moorings.  The inner "marina" is normally full of local yachts and it is doubtful a berth can be found here.</span></p>
<p><span>There is water and electricity available and a public shower and WC on shore. There is also a fuel station in town. Fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker. Ask the Coastguard. </span></p>
<p><span>While space is limited, shelter is excellent and many cruisers find this a lively spot to spend the winter as unlike many other coastal Greek towns, it does not "die" during the winter months.</span></p>
<p>Local weather (in English) on VHF channel 85 at 0600/1000/1600 &amp; 2200 UTC.</p>
