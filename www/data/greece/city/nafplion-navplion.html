<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large harbour, but the northern half is very shallow.</p>
<p>Moor stern-to or alongside the southern quay in the inner basin, which is east of the ferry terminal. The bottom is rather glutinous mud and some plough anchors do not hold well in it. Shelter is reasonably good, but in strong northerlies it is more comfortable to anchor off the quay.</p>
