<div class="hello"><div><p>The island of Limnos is rather isolated from the other islands in the eastern  Sporades group and, as a consequence, is less visited by tourists (and yachts).  However, it has good harbours, great beaches and clean water.</p>
<p>The town of Mirina (or Myrina) has interesting alleyways and small shops and the whole is  overlooked by a prominent Genoese castle. It is on the west coast of the island.</p>
<p>Position 39°52.34'N, 25°03.5'E.</p></div></div>

<p>This is a port of entry. All the facilities for checking in/out are based here,  with the Port Police and Customs in the same building at the west end of the  harbour wall.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/greece-pics/greece_myrina-harbour_my-leeze"/>The principal harbour at Mirina (<i>photo courtesy of MY LeeZe</i>) has an easy entry both day and night. The North  breakwater is now complete, and the shelter much improved.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> The holding in the mud/sand of the harbour is good, as is the shelter from the  prevailing NE wind. Anchor within the 5m contour. There is a dinghy landing by  the entrance to the inner harbour.</p>
<p>Other good anchorages on Limnos are to be found at Ormos Moudhrou (on the  southern coast), Ormos Kondia (on the SW side), Ormos Thanos (about 5 NM S of  Mirina) and Ormos Ay Pavlou (about 4 NM E of Thanos).</p>
<p><strong>Berthing</strong><br/> The Inner Quay - berthing stern or bows-to using your anchor.<br/> The Northern Jetty - berthing side-to, if there is no ferry due.<br/>The Southern Jetty - no berthing here as this is the commercial jetty.<br/> Yachts should note however that ferries in fact use both the Southern jetty and  the Northern jetty, especially if there is a strong NE wind blowing, then the Northern jetty is preferred.</p>
<p>The town quay is safe enough, but with a strong NE wind yachts berthed there  tend to surge in the gusts. Many put out springs, but there still tends to be a  certain amount of crashing and bashing. Skippers should make sure that the mast  is not in line with that of the next yacht. Cruisers also report that the bottom here is full of debris, so snagging your anchor is likely.</p>
<p>Water and electricity are supposed to be metered using a  card system, however currently this is not functioning therefore water and electricity are free.</p>
<p>Weather forecast (in English) is on VHF channel 82 at 0600/1000/1600/2200hrs  UTC.</p>
<p><span>The town is very pleasant and has two reasonably sized supermarkets, some good butchers, a decent hardware store, and nice restaurants. The main shopping street leads from the port past the fort toward the Greek Church in the center of town.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The Fort is up about 900 meters from the town vertically, and occupies a large plateau. It is in the process of being restored, however information about its history is limited.</span></p>
