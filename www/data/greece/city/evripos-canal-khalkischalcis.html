<div class="hello"><div><p>Between Euboea (Evia) Island and mainland Greece, the Khalkis bridge only opens at slack tide or when ships can pass with a following tide, as there is a very strong current at other times.</p>
<p><span>The bridge opens from 2200 to 0400 every day except the first Friday night of the month. Go to the Port Authority between 1600 and 2000 to pay the fee and get your scheduled time.</span> If necessary, contact the Port Authority (Tel: 22210 28888) for information.</p>
<p>Southbound traffic transits first.</p>
<p>The town of Khalkis is the capital of Evia and its waterfront an attractive area. Evia is a beautiful island and well worth a visit by car if you are stuck waiting and seek some alternative to sailing.</p>
<p><i>The latest cruiser reports on the Evia Channel and the Khalkis Bridge can be found <b><a class="external-link" href="Members/sue/R2009-07-17-5/">here</a></b> and by looking at the comments at the bottom of the page.</i></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Port Police office is on the southeast side of the bridge on Evia itself. Go straight ahead after crossing the bridge on foot, past a large blue "Parking" sign. The Port Police building is about 50 meters up on the right side, but the entrance is hard to find because it is up a small, unlikely looking alley just before you get to the building. This may change once all the surrounding building work is completed.</p>
<p>It is necessary to go with your boat papers to the Port Police to notify them of your request to go through the bridge and to pay the fee. Once you have done this, call them on Ch 12 at a specified time to find out the specific time of bridge opening (at slack water between the hours of 2200 and 0400). The Port Police will call you by boat name when they want you to proceed. You need to be up and ready with anchor weighed because you only have 10 minutes maximum to pass through once they have called.</p>
<p>The toll for the bridge went up on 1 July 2015 to <span>36 € for a 12 metre boat. </span>This includes the additional charge of 25% for night-time passage (yachts are only allowed through at night). There is an additional charge of 75% for passage on a Sunday or holiday.</p>
<p><span>When transiting the bridge South to North it makes sense to anchor under the fort (10m Good Holding) and dinghy into the port police. Alternatively tie up to the quay, pay and then go and anchor.</span></p>
<p><span>There is only one warning (of VHF channel 12) when the bridge is about to open - do not delay, the operator will not wait!</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage south of the bridge under the fort with good holding in clay. Take the dinghy ashore on the jetty north of the bridge on the west side. <strong>NOTE:</strong> there is about a 2.5ft tidal range here at springs.</p>
<p>There is now also a yacht harbour (Tel: <span>22210 63121) </span>here with water and electricity. It is in the bight south of the bridge, close to the yacht club at <span>Vourkari Cove.</span> Med moor with lazy lines. It is reported to be shallow here.</p>
<p>There are good shops ashore and water on the quay.<br/> NOTE: It has been reported that there are a large number of rats about in this area.</p>
<p>It is not so clear where to stop on the north side of the bridge to go through the formalities when passing through south. <span>There are town docks on the east and west side of the channel before the beach and berthing for visitors is marked in red. This means no local boats should occupy these spaces. Berthing marked with no colour is for anybody. You may have to raft up. <span> The dock on the </span><span>island side has poles with water and electricity with smart-cards. These smart-cards are valid for ALL the harbours in Evia.</span> It can be rough alongside the town docks because of the traffic and current flow.</span></p>
<p><strong>Additional Note:</strong> The direction of the buoyage changes here - the bridge itself is the port.</p>
<p><b>Boatyards</b></p>
<p>On the mainland coast close to Khalkis, directly opposite (south of) Eretria, lies <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/Evia/Countries/Greece/EvriposCanal?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">Oropos</a></b> - an open bay and the mainland ferry terminal for Eretria. Oropos houses two boatyards familiar with cruising yachts.</p>
