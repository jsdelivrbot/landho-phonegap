<div class="hello"><div><p>This lush, axe-shaped island lies close to the coast of Albania. At its narrowest, the channel separating it is just a mile wide. Although being a popular and busy holiday destination, it is still possible to find places to enjoy its quiet beauty.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Mandraki, the old harbour below the fortress, offers the best shelter, particularly alongside the outer breakwater. It is shallow so go bows-to. Fees include water, electricity and WiFi. Be sure to pull yourself well off the quay with the laid lines, as there tends to be alot of wake here from passing commercial traffic and it can get choppy in strong northerlies.</p>
<p>The town quay is silting up and can now only take very shallow draft boats.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is an anchorage south of the port in the bay, Ormos Garitsas. Here, there is shelter from the prevailing winds and the holding is good.</p>
