<p><strong><a href="../Argostoli">Argostoli</a> </strong>- see separate entry - is the capital.</p>
<p>All the towns on the island (with the exception of Fiskardho) were destroyed in the 1953 earthquake and have been rebuilt using reinforced concrete. Consequently Fiskardho is the most charming of island ports, and the most popular. Be sure to arrive early in the day to secure quay space. A few old buildings remain, giving a hint of its more elegant past.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Fiskardho</strong> <br/>Perched on the NE extremity of the island, this is a safe and attractive port and very popular with yachts. Rafting out may be necessary or, alternatively, anchor in the bay. The floating pontoon was destroyed in 2012 and was not replaced in 2013. It's unclear as to whether it has now been re-installed. Water (from the restaurants if dining there), good provisions, chandlery, good range of restaurants, bank, ATM, internet cafe and lots of gift shops.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="../../greece-pics/greece_kephalonia_ay-eufimia-quay"/>Ay Eufimia<br/></strong>(<i>Photo courtesy of SY Josephine</i>).<br/>Tucked into the NW corner of the shallow bay on Kephalonia's east coast, this used to be the island's main port. A useful spot from which to visit lake Melissani. <span>The local government together with local companies have set up and maintain the visitors quay. There is an administrative lady (to collect the fees) and 2 men with VHF to guide and help yachts moor. There is good depth along the quay and good holding. </span></p>
<p>Potable water and electricity are available on the quay (<span>approx. 4€ for electricity per day, water a minimum of 5€ charged but is metered - 1000 litres for 10€ ). It is not permitted to use water to wash down boats here. F</span>uel berth, bank and ATM, restaurants and chandlery all close to the quay.</p>
<p><strong>Sami</strong> <br/>Now the principal port for this area as well as the ferry terminal, it lies on the southern shore of the same bay as Ay Eufimia. Berth in the eastern basin. <span>There is now a harbour master in charge who will direct you to a berth and help with mooring. The harbour master visits daily to collect berthing fees (standard Greek harbour dues). There is f</span><span>ree drinking water available at the quay, but NO electricity. Fuel,</span><span> bank and ATMs nearby.</span></p>
<p><strong>Poros</strong><br/>38N08.802 / 020E46.776<br/>The harbour here is pretty shallow (2-4m) with a mud bottom. Holding is good and new stainless rings have now been installed on the old ferry berth making mooring here simpler. There are r<span>estaurants and a supermarket near the quay (less than 100m). </span><span>Water is also available via 4 long hoses around the quay (good pressure). It is not clear if this water is drinkable. T</span><span>here is a manned Port Police station here, however cruisers report berthing here for free in 2014.</span></p>
