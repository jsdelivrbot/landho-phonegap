<div class="hello"><div><p>Lavrion is the only real port on the southern tip of mainland Greece. It lies on the eastern coast, about 10NM from Sounion. It is a large commercial and fishing harbour.</p>
<p>Having been cleaned up for the 2004 Olympics to host a number of cruise ships, it now presents a much more attractive port of call.</p>
<p>Position 37°41.9'N, 24°03.3'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/47da4a67e0ce41078f6c9bdae2292827/@@images/image/preview"/>Within the harbour, adjacent to the small fishing harbour, there is a section reserved for yachts on the town quay (on the outside of the "L" shaped mole). The Harbour Authority have also installed a new pontoon off the end of the mole, which has water and electricity<i> (photo courtesy of SY Funny Girl)</i>.</p>
<p><span>Several charter companies operate from here so most of the berths are used by these companies. M</span>idweek however, you may be lucky and get a berth. Call the Harbour Authority on arrival and they will allocate you a berth.<span> There are fixed laid lines here and you should not anchor. </span></p>
<p>Be sure to pay the Harbour Authorities only for your berth. Other people, including the charter companies, may ask you to pay them, but the Harbour Authorities are the only office you should visit with payment.</p>
<p><span>The town quay is subject to swell in strong southerlies. </span></p>
<p>A better alternative is the marina just south of the town. The Olympic Marina is large and has an extensive range of repair facilities. At one time the Carter 33's and 37's were built here. Shelter is good in the marina.</p>
