<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Preveza_IonianMarine.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/>This mainland harbour, just north of the island of Lefkas, guards the inland waters of the Gulf of Amvrakia.</p>
<p>Position 38°57.5'N, 20°45.4'W.</p>
<p>Be careful to pick up the outer channel markers leading into Preveza. They are a fair distance offshore and can be difficult to see, especially with the heat haze off the land. More conspicuous is the airport tower with a large white ball on top just south of the entrance to Preveza.</p>
<p>The channel is marked with port and starboard channel markers, varying in quality. There are mud banks either side.</p>
<p>Beware of the current which will often be running through the buoyed channel (up to 3 knots!) and with a NW wind, this can create an unpleasant chop.</p>
<p>The car ferries very rarely run now across the channel, having been replaced by a tunnel.</p>
<p>Whilst it is rather a slog up the buoyed channel to get into Preveza, it is a useful stopover prior to or after transiting the Lefkas canal and has a lively <span>café</span> scene, particularly at night.</p>
<p>With three boatyards, this is a popular place for winter storage.</p>

<p>The offices of the Port Police, Customs and Immigration are rather spread out, but the tourist office on the quay can provide a very useful map.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Port Police is behind the building - not easy to find (see yellow arrow on map)!</p>
<p>Cruisers clearing into Greece here in September 2016 could not receive a dekpa form as the port police office had run out. There appears to be a shortage of dekpa forms as a new system is being introduced in 2017 (we are still waiting on details). See <strong>comments at bottom of</strong><strong> page</strong> for further details.</p></div></div>

<p>Shelter in the harbour itself is good and Preveza can be a useful port of refuge should the weather turn bad. In strong SE winds there can be a surge here.</p>
<p><strong>Town Quay</strong></p>
<p>Mooring is free stern-to on the west town quay <i>(yellow line on map)</i> and the more northerly section in front of the <span>cafés</span><span> </span><span>does have water &amp; electricity columns. It can however get very noisy in the evenings on this part of the quay, so if wanting a quieter night choose a spot in the southern half or head to the marina. It can be uncomfortable here in easterlies or southerlies.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Marinas</strong></span></p>
<p>Further to the north lies the town basin and Preveza Marina, with fixed concrete pontoons for yachts in addition to the usual long wall <i>(green area on map)</i>. The quay is much improved and works are underway in 2016 to further improve the facilities here (see comment at bottom of page). Yachts tend to moor alongside. Shelter is good and the town centre a 10 minute walk away. Alot of yachts prepare their boats here prior to hauling out at one of the boatyards on the other side of the bay.</p>
<p>The new Cleopatra marina is sited on the Aktion peninsula opposite Preveza. It's a more peaceful alternative to Preveza but for some might be a little isolated. Call ahead for a berth and advice (as it can be difficult manoeuvring here with the currents) on VHF Ch.67. There can be a surge in this marina with strong westerlies.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><span>There is a well protected anchorage to the north of the harbour with good holding. It is open to the south east, but the prevailing wind here is from the NW.</span></p>
<p><span>The town is typically Greek and rather smart after receiving EU funding. It has many cafes, restaurants and shops.</span></p>
