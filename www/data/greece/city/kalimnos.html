<div class="hello"><div><p>This bare, craggy limestone island lies immediately south of Leros separated by the narrow channel of Stenon Lerou.</p>
<p>It is the centre of the sponge fishing industry. <span style="text-align: justify; ">The departure (April-May) and return (Sept-Oct) of the sponge-fishing fleet are celebrated with lively festivities.</span></p>
<p>The main port is Kalimnos (formerly called Pothia). <span style="text-align: justify; ">From a distance Kalimnos town, the monastery on the hill and the shining cupola of the cathedral can be seen. <span style="text-align: justify; ">With the Meltemi blowing there are strong gusts off the high land down into the approaches and in Ormos Kalimnou itself.</span></span></p>
<p>Vathi is a small port to the NE of Kalimnos providing good shelter. It has water available on the quay and very limited provisions, with of course a few taveranas, but has no repair facilities.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>In Kalimnos, there is berthing for visiting yachts on the NW quay just past the ferry dock. Being so close to the ferry dock this quay does suffer from surge created by ferry wash, so be sure to pull your boat a good distance off the quay and use snubbers. Fortunately the prevailing wind tends to blow boats off the quay.</span></p>
<p><span>Moor stern-to or bows-to on the quay. It is very crowded here and can be difficult to find a berth. The shelter is good, but the holding is less certain if the anchor does not penetrate the weed so be sure to let out lots of chain. Take care berthing stern-to as depths can be shallow in places (1.5-2m). </span></p>
<p><span>Water and electricity are available and fuel can be delivered by mini-tanker. The Harbour Master’s office is located on the ferry quay near the authorities, however it is likely he will find you first. See latest fees charged here in comments at bottom of page.</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst this quay offers good shelter, in a southerly the SW quay at the root of the ferry dock will offer better protection.</span></p>
<p><span>If arriving at night, there is space to anchor to starboard on entering the harbour, out of the main channel.</span></p>
<p><span>Work on the basic structure of a new Kalimnos Marina was completed in 2002, however no further work has been done since so it’s unlikely this will ever be operational.</span></p>
