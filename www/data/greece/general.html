<div><p><strong>YACHTING ESSSENTIALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Electricity</strong></p>
<p>Voltage:  220 V / <span>Frequency:  50 Hz.<br/>Some marinas also have 380 V. </span></p>
<p><span>In all marinas and some harbours it is possible to get shore power. The majority of marinas include this in the marina berthing charge. A variety of electrical connectors is a "must'. </span></p>
<p><span>Note that in some places the electricity supply can be prone to surges. Be sure to turn off any sensitive equipment on board and invest in a polarity checker to see if there any faults in the shore-side wiring before use.</span></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<p>In many of the Islands and in some mainland ports, water is in short supply. Normally the time to take care is near the end of the summer months, when often public supply points are turned off due to shortages. In most harbours you will find a "water man" who is responsible for administering water and charging for it. Whilst charges are normally fixed by the council, it's worth checking the cost before taking water and negotiating if the price seems high. In some harbours, water is delivered by truck. This is a private service and costs accordingly. A length of hosepipe (approx. 25m) and a range of connectors are useful to have on board. Marinas often have coin-operated water service.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel</strong></p>
<p>Whilst there are a few fuel docks in Greece, in the main diesel fuel for yachts is delivered to the quay by mini-tanker (a truck with a tank on the bank and powered delivery pump). Normally the telephone number for the fuel truck will be on a noticeboard or similar by the yacht quay. If not, enquire locally.</p>
<p><strong>LPG / Gas</strong></p>
<p>Greek gas bottles are a bright green colour and only accepted in Greece. The connection is identical to the old Camping Gaz bottles. Common practice is to exchange bottles. If a yacht is fitted with Calor Gas type bottles, an adaptor can be purchased in Greece. Gas is easy to find in the larger towns, but harder on the small islands where supplies are limited.</p></div>

<div><p>International Dialing Code for Greece is +30.</p>
<p>Mobile phone - Call your cell phone provider to make sure that they offer phone coverage in Greece. Ask to be upgraded to international roaming.</p>
<p>A prepaid Greece SIM card with international cell phone is the most convenient and economical solution for staying in touch while in Greece. All incoming calls while you travel Greece are FREE, regardless of where they originate. Pay the local rate for local calls and use a cellular phone in Greece like you do at home. And unlike home, your Greece SIM card and cell phone service is prepaid so there is no need for a contract.</p>
<p>For internet access, <span>purchase a mini-modem from Vodaphone or Cosmote. This will give you internet in anchorages and underway, 3G and sometimes 4G. </span></p></div>

<div><p><strong>Ferrys</strong></p>
<p>The Greek ferry system is the mainstay of travel around Greece. There is a wide range of companies offering tickets on all routes. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.greekferries.gr">www.greekferries.gr</a></strong></p>
<p>Fast ferries operating between Greece and Italy (and in some parts of the Aegean Islands) can cause massive amounts of wash, in particular in the northern Ionian around Corfu, Cephalonia and Ithaca and in the Aegean around Ios and Siros. Be aware when in protected anchorages that wash can be a problem and have a long line ashore or pull yourself a good distance off the jetty.</p>
<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
<p>The Greek domestic bus service is very good. This is run by KTEL - <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.ktel.org">www.ktel.org</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Train</strong></p>
<p>The train network is very limited outside Athens. There are two mainline routes, one from Athens around the Peloponnese via Patras, Kiparissi, Kalamata, Navplion and Corinth, and the other north from Athens to Volos, Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.alleuroperail.com">www.alleuroperail.com</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Car</strong></p>
<p>The road network in Greece has been improved in recent years, however in general they are still rather poor. Most towns have car hire agencies with costs in line with the rest of the EU. Greece still has one of the worst accident records in Europe.</p>
<p><span>Be aware that in Greece, unlike in most other Mediterranean countries, they want to see an international drivers license, which you cannot get online instantly. The larger agencies will not rent you a car without this, however local agencies may be more flexible.</span></p></div>

<p>Note: <span>If any vessel, Greek or otherwise, reports any sort of a problem to the port authorities, which could possibly affect there seaworthiness, (grounding or mechanical failure etc),  the port police will then require that they have a surveyor's report to say vessel is seaworthy before it is allowed to leave the harbour.  This will be rigidly enforced, especially if the vessel has required assistance or is unable to moor correctly in the harbour, ie alongside, stern too etc.  Therefore, unless there is a danger of life it is best not to involve the port police unless absolutely necessary (they will appreciate this also). </span></p></div>

      This yachtsman's pilot by Tony Cross for the Greek island of Crete was begun originally as a set of cruising notes following a cruise around Crete in October and November 2007. Since then the cruising notes have been gradually updated and added to as more ports and anchorages were visited, either by Tony or by trusted close friends. In 2010 it was felt that they were complete enough to be useful as a yachting pilot for Crete. The information in here is regularly updated and amendments, additions, useful photographs or general comments about this pilot are appreciated.
