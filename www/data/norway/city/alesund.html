<div class="hello"><div><p>Most visitors' moorings are on the pontoons at the southern end of the inner harbour which are reached via the entance on the northern side of the island. At busy times there may be another pontoon in the outer harbour.</p>
If coming from the West or the North or if a yacht has a higher mast than 17m, the best approach is from the north, leaving Heissa Island to starboard.<br>
There are ticket machines to pay your harbour dues, one at the Vågen near the Tourist Information Centre, the other in Brusund (E side). (300 NOK for 40’ (2015)).<br>
