<div class="hello"><div><p>You can tie up to the bridge on the east side of the canal, or enter the yacht harbour, <span>Moss Gjestehavn.</span> Look for green signs, indicating availability. It is on the east-side of Jeloy, some 5 cables SW of the canal. This option is only suitable if your draft is less than 2.3m and loa less than 45 feet (14m).</p>
<p><span>Better and quieter are berths N of bridge, via Mossesund from the north.</span></p>
<p>The bridge across the canal does not open.</p>
<p>There are provisions available, and 2 chandlers. Also restaurants, as well as nice beaches, are all to be found a short walk from both harbours.</p>
