<div class="hello"><div><p>The surrounding islands provide shelter, although the harbour is somewhat exposed to the south.</p>
<p>The pontoon moorings now give better protection from South and increased capacity.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts can lie alongside wavebreaking pontoon or moor bows-on with stern anchor.</p>
<p>Electricity (two pin Norwegian socket - adaptors available from electrician off main square) and water on pontoon.</p>
<p>Free WiFi. Bread rolls distributed to each boat at breakfast time by harbour office during summer season!</p>
