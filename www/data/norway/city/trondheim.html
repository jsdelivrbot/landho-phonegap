It is located about a third of the way up the west coast where the river Nidelva enters the large fjord of Trondheimsfjorden.

      This bridge allows access into the Kanal Havna, where there are a few guest berths. Being close to the railway station, it can be rather noisy. <br>

If wishing to proceed further, into the Nidelva river, make arrangements with the Skansen bridge operator for the opening of the Nidelva bridge.
