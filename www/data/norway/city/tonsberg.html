<div class="hello"><div><p>You can practically tie your boat up to any one of several outdoor restaurants or go to the guest harbour a bit further west for peace. The guest harbour can get a bit uncomfortable, but not dangerous in a strong SW. Avoid the outside of the pontoons if possible.</p>
<p>There are also many new local marinas on the approaches to the canal.</p>
<p>The new bridge opens 5 minutes before the old bridge for E-bound and 5 minutes after old bridge for W-bound vessels.</p>
<p>The marked channel SE of Tønsberg canal continues through a huge expanse of quite shallow water. There are extensive charted anchorages south of this marked channel at Træla.</p>
