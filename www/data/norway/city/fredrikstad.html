<div class="hello"><div><p>There are 3 bridges over the Vestereleva (West River). Be aware that the river can flow at up to 2kts.</p>
<p>There are 60 guest berths (20 with water and electricity) between the two southern bridges.</p>
<p>Berthing fees and access card to the facilities (which are in the Town Hall, 30m from quay) from Harbour Master.</p>
<p>The best place to moor is 100m N of the most southerly bridge (to avoid noise from traffic and from the early morning bridge opening).</p>
