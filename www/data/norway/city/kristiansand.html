<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very large, sheltered harbour, but the visitors' berths are close to the town centre. Mooring is bows to jetty with stern buoys. Outside berths subject to swell. A few berths alongside, no doubling up.</p>
<p>Tokens for showers and laundry from kiosk.</p>
<p>It gets very full but Harbourmaster is most helpful.</p>
