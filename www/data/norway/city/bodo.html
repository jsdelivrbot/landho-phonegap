<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is one of the largest towns in northern Norway. It perches on the tip of a peninsula on the mainland, opposite the extreme southern end of the Lofoten Islands. </p>
<p>This is a good place to see the midnight sun (end of May to the middle of July).</p>
<p>Position 67°17.3'N, 14°22.9'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is generally open to the SW. The fishing boat pontoon offers more shelter than the one for visitors, but is only available during the summer (mid June to mid August).</p>
<p>Visitors’ pontoons are in the SE corner of the harbour, below the hotel and next to pontoon reserved for fishing. Both have water and electricity. Showers and laundry machines on ground floor of Molo Stua are operated by credit card, or on request by a harbour hostess who will take cash for these and for berthing (this avoids the additional cost of each use of a non-Norwegian credit card). During office hours telephone the number outside the facilities’ door for assistance.</p>
<p>It is possible to winter either afloat or ashore here.  Customs will help fill in forms for permission to stay (these can also be filled in online). Approval is usually granted within a week of submission.</p>
