                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>Norway requires all yachts to clear into the country but rules are more relaxed if coming from another Nordic country or a Schengen Area country.</p>
<p>Yachts from Nordic countries do not need to make a customs declaration provided they are not carrying an excess of dutiable stores and equipment and do not remain in Norwegian waters more than six months.</p>
<p>Yachts from other countries should report immediately on arrival at a Port of Entry. The penalties for importing excess alcohol or tobacco are severe.</p>
<p>The captain should report to Customs and show the ship's documents and passports. Customs must be cleared at a quay in the main harbour before moving to a berth for yachts. Immigration must be contacted on arrival and both Immigration and Customs must be cleared on departure.</p>
<p>When completing the normal clearance at a Port of Entry, a list of Harbours to be visited is required. These Harbours actually mean Harbour Districts, which in Norway, are very large areas. They DO NOT mean every port you wish to enter! This is, of course, not at all clear on the (English) form provided.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, port authorities like to be advised when a boat arrives or leaves a port, if it is possible, and if the port is big enough to have any officials based there. There is no requirement for official clearance except at the first port of arrival into the country or the last when leaving Norwegian waters.</p>
<p>If you expect to cross the border into Norway at a place remote from an Immigration office, then special permission is required. In this instance, PRIOR permission must be obtained and a Permit issued by the local Police Station. There has to be a very specific reason why this would NOT be granted. You will then be informed of the location as to where you must visit Immigration.</p>

<div><p>Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it <strong>is</strong> a member of the Schengen Agreement Area. See<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/General/EuropeanUnion"><strong>Noonsite' Schengen page</strong> </a> for more details on the immigration rules.</p>
<p>List of countries with whom Norway has bilateral agreements covering vists by their nationals:- Countries of the EU, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Singapore, Uruguay, USA, Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is understood that these agreements (which usually entail visits of up to 90 days, depending on the country) do not come under the Schengen Areement rules.</p>
<p>The previous requirement to have a special <i>Sailing Permit</i> no longer applies.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>On arrival, notify Customs at the first Port of Entry.</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared. All firearms must have a licence from the country of origin. Firearms must be re-exported within three months, if not an application for a permit must be made.</p>
<p>Customs rules specify that only up to 22 lb (10 kg) of agricultural products are allowed to be imported, of which 6.6 lb (3 kg) may be meat and processed meat products from other Nordic countries. Tinned meat from all countries is allowed but fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy products are restricted as are eggs and potatoes. It is unlikely that these rules will be enforced in the case of a yacht where the products are not take ashore.</p>
<p>There are strict restrictions on the import of alcohol and a heavy tax is imposed for excess amounts. A deposit must be paid on excess amounts and the items placed under seal until leaving Norwegian waters. This deposit will be refunded on proof from foreign Customs that the yacht has arrived in the next country.</p>
<p>A boat can remain stored in Norway, without special permission, for up to 6 weeks in any 12 month period but it may not be used by others if left this way.</p>
<p>If you want to leave the boat for longer than six weeks, you must apply to Norwegian Customs for permission <b>before</b> you leave the country. Initially you apply for one year from the time it entered the country. If you need to leave the boat for longer than 1 year, you must make a second application. Such a boat cannot be used by others.The Customs department has created a standard application form for boat owners, see <strong><a href="http://www.toll.no/en/services/forms/application-for-temporary-storage-of-vessel/">www.toll.no/en/services/forms</a></strong>. A total of two years from initial entry into Norway is the maximum time allowed.</p>
<p>It is <strong>VERY important</strong> to apply to Customs IN ADVANCE for permission to leave the boat. Failure to do so may result in a criminal charge of illeagal importation, the penalty for which carries a very substantial fine as well as VAT of 25% of the value of the boat. <br/> See the official website at <a href="http://www.toll.no/en/goods/boat/storing-a-foreign-recreational-boat/"><strong>www.toll.no/en/goods/boat</strong></a> for the details.</p>
<p>The vessel may only be used by the person to whom clearance is given and cannot be used for commercial purposes.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Sailing close to military areas is prohibited, such areas being marked on charts and usually indicated by signposts on the shore.</p>
<p>Numerous fish farms are found along the coast, and boats are required to keep a safe distance.</p>
<p>There are various conservation areas for sea birds along the coasts, access to which is prohibited between 15 April and 15 July, including the surrounding sea for 164 ft (50 m).</p>
<p>The shoreline in anchorages is normally privately owned and one should ask the owner's permission first before landing. By the same token, Norway has strict laws protecting public access, and unless you are within 150m of a home or on cultivated land, anchoring and even camping is permitted.</p>
<p>No fires may be lit on shore from 15 April to 15 September.</p>
<p>No garbage may be thrown overboard and toilets may be pumped out only well away from harbours and sailing lanes.</p>
<p>A warning is issued to boats cruising the fjords to pay careful attention to the height restrictions caused by overhead cables and bridges.</p>
<p><b>Fishing</b><br>
Anyone over 16 years old fishing for salmon, sea trout, sea char or freshwater fish in waters on common land must pay an annual fee at any post office. A local fishing licence is also compulsory and this can be obtained from sports shops, kiosks and tourist offices. The licence only covers a certain area, and can be bought for a day, week, month or whole season. Restrictions are normally stated on the licence. Live bait is forbidden. Rivers and lakes may also be in private ownership, with their own permits enforced by the owners.</br></p>
<p>Fishing seasons vary from district to district.</p>
<p>Sea fishing with rod or hand lines is open to anyone, and no fishing fee must be paid, unless fishing for salmon, sea trout or sea char. The closed season for these fish is 5 August-31 May.</p>
<p>Foreigners may only use hand gear such as rods or jigs. Nets and similar devices may not be used.</p>
<p><b>Flag etiquette</b><br>
The courtesy flag must be flown from sunrise to sunset only, but not before 0800 and not after 2100. It is considered very discourteous to leave the flag flying after sunset.</br></p>
