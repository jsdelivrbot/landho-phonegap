<p>For non-emergency calls and harbour contact, Telenor (Maritim Radio) keeps a list of the VHF working channels for all coast radio stations at <a href="http://www.maritimradio.no/kystradio/pdf/vhfs.pdf">www.maritimradio.no</a></p>
<p>Mobile phones are the preferred method of communication between boats.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone Services</strong><br/> The dominating phone system is GSM mobile, which covers 99% of the landmass. Conventional telephone also has near 100% coverage, but the usage of public telephone booths is falling as mobile takes over.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Phones</strong><br/> A prepaid Norway SIM card with an international cell phone is the most convenient and economical solution with all incoming calls in Norway are FREE, regardless of where they originate. The Norway SIM card provides service across Norway through domestic roaming. Pay the local rate for local calls and use a cellular phone in Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Internet</strong><br/> Most of the country is covered by broadband internet, including sparsely populated remote regions.</p>
<p>In the cities it is generally possible to locate a WiFi hotspot or an internet café. WiFi access is also common in hotels, railway stations, on trains, ferries and increasingly in the harbours. In more remote spots actual access may prove more cumbersome; it may be necessary (and rarely difficult) to ask for a loan of a private connection in cafés or shops.</p>

Norway has a coordinated system for sea rescue. A call to a coastal radio station via VHF channel 16 or phone should trigger simultaneous notifications to police, air services, the Sea Rescue ships and if required, the medical emergency services. </br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The coast radio stations may also be reached by a shared phone No. 120 (regular phone, not VHF). These stations also receive automatic DSC calls on channel 70.</p>
