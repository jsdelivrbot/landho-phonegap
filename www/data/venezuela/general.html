<p>Cruisers advise that to take advantage of the favorable "black market" rate (approx. double that of the official rate) you should bring US$'s in large denomination notes. If you rely on plastic you will get the "not so favorable" official rate.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to change money on the street and if you are using a cash machine do not use any machines where you have to "swipe" your card.</p>

<p>Mobile Phones - Visit Venezuela with a local prepaid SIM card and international cell phone for the best coverage and lowest cost cell phone calling.<br/></p>
<p>A Venezuela cell phone is indispensable in terms of security and convenience.<br/></p>
<p>Alternatively for good coverage and competitive rates in Venezuela, buy an International Roaming SIM Card before you depart. This cell phone service is prepaid and there is no need for a deposit, credit-check or contract. Relative to buying separate SIM cards for all the countries you are visiting, it is also highly affordable. Unlike a Venezuela cell phone rental, outgoing and incoming rates are relatively low cost, and there are no fees.<br/></p>

<p>Health care in state hospitals is free, but the standards vary and foreign visitors are advised to have medical insurance. For serious medical emergencies it may be worth contacting Hospital de Clinicas in Caracas (Tel. (2) 574-2011), which provides a full range of hospital and out-patients services. Many of the staff speak English. Cash payment is expected at the time of service, but fees are reported to be reasonable and the care excellent.</p>
