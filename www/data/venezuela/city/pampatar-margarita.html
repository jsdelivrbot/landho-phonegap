      Formerly known as the Hilton marina. Located a few miles east of Porlamar. 231 berths. Basic facilities (water and electricity at some slips). Described as "a big open-ended bathtube with bollards", conditions are basic and rough. Med moor to the quays. Probably most secure berthing option available in the area.
