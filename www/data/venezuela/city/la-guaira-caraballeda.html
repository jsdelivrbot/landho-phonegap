            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Clearance must be made at La Guaira and yachts may have to use an agent to clear in. Arriving yachts should anchor and display the Q flag. If arriving outside working hours (0700-1200, 1400-1700 Monday to Friday) one should call the port captain on VHF Ch 16 to arrange clearance. It is recommended to arrive in working hours otherwise one will probably experience some delay and have to pay overtime fees.</p>
<p>For a fee of up to US$100, the agent does all the paperwork and brings all the officials to the dock together. For outward clearance the agent delivers stamped passports and clearance papers to the fuel dock. Immigration is on the NW of the passenger terminal by the dock. One must clear here for Caraballeda.</p>
<p>Agents: Arturo Vasquez, tel 011 5814 927 6004 (mobile), Ibrahim Rodriguez ("Popeye"), mobile 011 5814 934 7386.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care at the marina at Caraballeda -  there are sunken boats unmarked in the middle of the channel 2ft<span> </span>below the surface which have been there since 1999.</p>
<p>Other local advice suggests taking shelter in the bay of the private marina in Puerto Azul (<a href="http://www.puertoazul.com">www.puertoazul.com</a>), some 6 nm East of Caraballeda (10.37.13 N  66.44.55 W). Although this is a private marina with no berths for visitors, it has a quite protected bay and when anchoring to leeward of the inner bay entrance, there is some security around and lots of light. There is a harbourmaster on duty during office hours and after office hours Puerto Azul security monitors Ch. 16. <br/><b>Note:</b> not recommended as a landing place.</p>
