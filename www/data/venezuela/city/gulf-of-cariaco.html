<div class="hello"><div><p>On Venezuela’s northern coast, stretching east from the city of Cumaná, lies the Gulfo de Cariaco. This huge, sausage-shaped bay encompasses a wonderful mult-coloured scenery of contrasting hills. It is regarded as a safe place to visit and has many small, snug coves. The northern shore offering better protection than the southern coast.</p>
