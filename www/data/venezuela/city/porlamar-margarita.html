<div class="hello"><div><p>Porlamar was once regarded by many as the only "safe" anchorage on Isla Margarita. During the hurricane season there used to be as many as 100-150 boats here. However the number of visiting yachts has declined substantially over the last couple of years and a quick look at the local webcam (<a href="http://www.margaritainfo.com/webcam.htm">http://www.margaritainfo.com/webcam.htm</a>) shows just a handful of yachts now anchored in the bay.</p>
<p>There no longer exists a gathering place for yachties here, and many of the services available to cruisers in the past, have now gone out of business.</p>
<p>Robberies from yachts do occur here and crew should be careful not to flash money around. Be sure to secure all items on deck and always lift and lock the dinghy and outboard at night.</p>
<p>Sadly a Dutch yachtsman was shot on board in September 2013 trying to resist a robbery. They were anchored off the El Concorde Marina. See<strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Venezuela/venezuela-isla-margarita-dutch-sailor-killed-whilst-resisting-robbery-on-board-september-2013/"> report</a></strong> adjacent.</p>
<p>Due to the security problems in Porlamar anchorage, it may be better to use the Marina Venetur near <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Venezuela/Pampatar/">Pampatar</a></strong>. There is no water or electricity here, but there is security.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Venezuela?rc=Formalities">Venezuela Formalities</a></b> for full details on clearing into and out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>International Clear in and out:</strong></p>
<p>Immigration raised Clearance costs significantly in 2010, making Porlamar probably the most expensive place to clear in the Caribbean. See report <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2010-12-04-1">here</a> </strong>for details of costs.</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary to use an "agent" to assist with entry and departure formalities - and in fact to clear in and out yourself here is now much easier than in the past (see agents listed under <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Venezuela/Porlamar?rc=MarineServices">General Services</a></strong>).</p>
<p>The customs, immigration and port captain offices are now in the same building at the northern end of Concorde beach and some officials speak English (although some Spanish does help). Leave your dinghy at the Concorde Marina dinghy dock, they will watch it for your for 5 Bolivares. You do have to go to town and make a bank deposit.</p>
<p><strong>National Clear in and out:</strong></p>
<p>There is some discussion as to whether or not this is a legal requirement to have to clear in and out between the islands and the mainland. Several cruisers report that they never bother and never have a problem.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>10deg 56.7'N, 63deg 50'W</p>
<p>There is a submerged wreck with about 3' of water covering it close to the El Morro headland, so be sure to not cut the corner when arriving. In addition there is a semi-submerged wreck in about 6' of water at the front of the anchorage, take care not to hit it with your dinghy.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>The Porlamar anchorage is hard sand, CQR anchors tend not to set so well here and 100' of chain is recommended. Winds can be from any direction, but any swell is usually from the east and can cause an unpleasent roll. A bridle or stern anchor will make life more comfortable.</p>
<p>Marina Juan went out of business in 2011 and Juan himself is reported to be deceased. The wooden dock in front of Juan's is still standing, however it is no longer a safe place to leave a dinghy. ONSA (the civilian Coast Guard auxiliary) have taken over this facility. There will likely be some enterprising soul at the Concorde Marina who will be offering dinghy security of some sort. Be sure to lock your dingy and outboard as they do get stolen here.</p>
<p><strong>Docking</strong></p>
<p>There is a small marina here that used to be part of the Hotel Concorde complex. It is easily spotted as a wooden dock jutting out from the Concord beach with a few people milling around. The area is locally termed "Marina Concorde", however it is very small with shallow draft and only accommodates local traffic. There is a dinghy dock here, near the Government Offices, which cruisers can use when coming ashore for clearance. However there are no other cruiser services available here.</p>
<p>The Marina Venetur is the only docking option when stopping in Margarita. The Coast Guard moors their boats there assuring a higher level of security. It is also reported to be relatively cheap and has water and electricity (at some of the slips). It is however often full in the 4 Venezuelan tourist seasons (Christmas, Carnival, Easter and Summer school holidays).</p>
<p>A limited number of repair facilities are available in Porlamar.</p>
<p>The hailing channel is VHF Ch:16. Channel 72 used to be the yachties chatting channel, with a daily net (not Sundays) at 0800.</p>

      Formerly known as the Hilton marina. Located a few miles east of Porlamar. 231 berths. Basic facilities (water and electricity at some slips). Described as "a big open-ended bathtube with bollards", conditions are basic and rough. However probably most secure berthing option available.
