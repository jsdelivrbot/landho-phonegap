<div class="hello"><div><p>This small group of islands lie about 60nm off the coast of Venezuela and approximately the same distance north east of Margarita Island. It is a nice restful stop on the way to Grenada.</p>
<p><span>There is a Coast Guard station on the main island where you must go and provide basic vessel and crew information. They are very helpful and co-operative.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Only fisherman live on the island .</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Position 11°23'N, 63°08'W</span></p>
<p>Cruisers should be aware that there have been attacks on yachts in this area in the past. See reports adjacent.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not a port of entry, but yachts can stop here. On arrival, yachts must check in with the Guarda Costa on Isla Iguana and will be given a maximum 3 days stay. Yachts wishing to stay longer have to clear into Venezuela first. No diving allowed or spear-fishing allowed, but snorkelling is granted.</p>
<p>Yachts should call the Guarda Costa again on departure. The area is occasionally patrolled by the Venezuelan Coast Guard, who will ask those who have overstayed to move on, and also insist that boats fly the Venezuelan courtesy flag.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>One good anchorage is off Isla Iguana, just west of Isla Cabra in about 4m over sand. Good holding,</p>
<p>A calm place to anchor is in SE corner of Balandra Bay, in Testigos Grande. Depth is 5m over hard sand. Another calm anchorage is off the village Tamarindo on Testigos Grande in about  8m over good sand.</p>
<p><span>There is no fuel available for sale here. The Venezuelan Navy brings in a ship with drinking water and fills up every tank in town. There are high speed local boats taking people to the mainland every day. They might, for a small fee, take jerry cans for refilling.</span></p>
