<p>Obtaining the necessary cruising permit may take several weeks.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It appears that the Venezuelan government has taken over the  marina at Puerto Cabello. This facility is quite near the naval base,  which provided some limited haulout facilities.</p>
<p>The marina is reported as being in a poor state of repair, and <span>there are sunken boats (unmarked) in the middle of the channel 2ft below the surface. They have been there since 1999.</span></p>
