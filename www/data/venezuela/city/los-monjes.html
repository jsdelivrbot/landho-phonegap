<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not a Port of Entry.</p>
<p>When within VHF range, call the Guarda Costa (Coast Guard) and give them as much information as possible in advance. It is likely however that they will catch you on radar and call you up on Ch. 16.</p>
<p>You may be asked to go alongside the dock for inspection. In most cases officials are likely to want to come aboard, so if not alongside the dock a dinghy ashore will be required to collect them.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The main island houses scientific and navy personnel only. It is used by Venezuelan fishermen for protection during bad weather.</p>
<p>The wharf is a strong well built concrete structure, about 80 metres
long. You may be asked to berth on the wharf, or go alongside a fishing boat on the wharf. There are no shore connections or water facility.</p>
<p>Alternatively a rope has been strung between 2 rocky islands and several boats can tie to this (although your neighbour could be a large, ugly fishing boat). Anchoring is not possible due to substantial depths. Note that it is possible this rope broke September 2011 and therefore only using the wharf is currently possible.</p>
<p>There is no fuel here.</p>
