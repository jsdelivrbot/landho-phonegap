            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>This group of islands lie about 120NM off the coast, due north of Caracus. Much of it is a National park and its pristine coral reefs attract many international visitors. It is a <span>nice place for cruising boats to stop on passage from the Windward Islands to the ABC-Islands.</span></p>
<p>Gran Roque, the capital, is the most easily accessible spot for tourists from the mainland. Consequently, all types of planes come and go at all hours, so it is not the totally quiet, remote island you might have expected.</p>
<p>However, other parts of the group are rarely visited and provide many quiet and peaceful anchorages.</p>
<p>Yachts should take care visiting here at this troubled time in Venezuela history (see comments at bottom of page).</p>
<p>Position 11°57′00″N, 66°40′36″W (Gran Roque)</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not an official port of entry, but yachts may visit here for a maximum of 15 days if not visiting the mainland.  Clearance must be completed (both in and out) at Roque Grande. Some yachts try to prolong their stay by <span>taking several days to reach Roque Grande where one has to do the clearance and also take time on departure after outward clearance. Take note that the penalty for illegally entering a country can be very tough.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Clearing in</strong></span></p>
<p>To clear in, the skipper must visit 4 authorities located in 5 different locations in a specific order:</p>
<p>1. <span>First go to the Immigration (SAIME) office, near the airport. They give you a bank account number, and you have to go to the bank and deposit the Immigration fee (see below). </span></p>
<p>2. Go to the Coast Guard (<i>Guardacosta</i>) - l<span>ocated in the trailer, next to the National Park office, near the airport. No <span>cost here, just paperwork.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Then to the National Park office </span></span></span><span>(</span><i>Inparques</i><span> or </span><i>Parque Nacional</i><span>), <span>who will give you information and a map and a document giving you special permission to visit the half closed areas (areas marked PM on the map) of the national reserve. Here you also pay your National Park entry fees (see below), <span> payable </span><span>in cash, no cards or dollars accepted.</span></span></span></p>
<p>You may also be asked to visit the National Guard (<i>Guarda Nacional</i>) - a white building on the seafront in the middle of the village, and the <span>Los Roques Authority (</span><i>Authoridad Unica</i><span>) - </span><span>white building in the middle of the village, no signs on the outside.</span></p>
<p>Once you have visited all offices and have paid your park entry fees, you are legitimately checked into Los Roques.</p>
<p>Using the services of an agent <span>could be useful and make clearing in alot easier. See details for cruiser-friendly agent </span><span>Alejandro Linares below. </span></p>
<p><strong>Clearance Fees</strong></p>
<p><span>Port Clearance in and out: $2 per ft.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Customs and Immigration </span><span>(SAIME)</span><span> tax: $40 per person</span></p>
<p><span><span>Foreign Flag Vessel’s Venezuelan Visa: $2.50 per ft.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Anchoring/ Mooring and cruising permit: $7 Per ft.</span></p>
<div>
<div title="Page 1">
<p><span>The cruising permit is issued for 7 days, which is the average stay of most vessels, however the National Parks allow an additional 7 days free of charge. </span><span>Once issued, a cruising permit is valid for 15 days and also covers the Archipelago Las Aves, which is part of Los Roques territory.</span></p>
<p><span>This cruising permit also qualifies each person onboard the following services at no cost:<br/></span><span>- Ambulance/Rescue Power boat 24-hours<br/></span><span>- Free health care in case of accidents and injuries, including medicines and dental for any nationality in a brand new hospital equipped with the latest technology available.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>National Park Fee: $45 per person</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is a small fee for a diving permit if wishing to dive. <br/>No spear fishing is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing Out</strong></p>
<p><span>When leaving Los Roques you have to return to El Gran Roque and clear out with the Coast Guard on the north side of town to get your zarpe. Finally vist Immigration to get your passports stamped - they will not stamp your passports without the zarpe.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>At Gran Roque, anchor off the western end of the village to avoid being in the way of landing planes; also when approaching be aware that aircraft fly extremely low over the beach to reach the runway.</p>
<p>The anchorage is rolly and windy at times and the holding not always the best.</p>
<p>The Francisqui (Francis Cay) anchorage - just east of G. Roque - is a lovely, large and well protected anchorage from all directions. There is a small beach bar/restaurant in the NE corner of the anchorage which serves excellent food. Only 1-2 miles from G. Roque.</p>
<p>Nordisqui (Nordis Cay) anchorage is not as scenic and not as well protected as many of the others. However, there is a good anchoring basin.</p>
<p>Carenero anchorage is very well protected and a favorite stop for fishing boats from whom fish can be purchased.</p>
<p><span>A quiet place to anchor is tucked in behind the reef at the southernmost tip near to Sebastapol.</span></p>
<p>The Herradurra anchorage at Tortuga is the most scenic and protected one mentioned in the Doyle Guide and excellent lobsters can be purchased from the fishermen's settlement there.</p>
<p>The west side of Isla Pelona is a calm anchorage and allows visiting the turtle research centre.</p>
<p><span>Cruisers recommend the anchorage at the Island of Crasqui (Cras Cay). The bay is protected by the shallows on the northern side and smaller islands on the south. There is a stunning beach and superb snorkelling.</span></p>
<p>With all the anchorages, the sketchs and charts provided by various sources should only be reguarded as a rough guide. Eyeball navigation in the correct light conditions is essential. Even official charts cannot be regarded as accurate.</p>
