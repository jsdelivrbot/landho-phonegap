            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>The two neighbouring Samoas are very different from each other, American Samoa being a US Territory, while Western Samoa is an independent state. American Samoa comprises all the Samoan islands east of the 171° parallel, that is the main island of Tutuila, as well as Aunuu, the Manua Group, Rose Island, and Swains Island.</li>
<li>This US outpost in the South Seas attracts most cruising boats because of the availability of US goods, excellent provisioning and good communications. </li>
<li>It is Pago Pago which attracts most cruising sailors, either to reprovision in its well-stocked supermarkets, or to spend the cyclone season in this scenically beautiful and well protected harbour. Unfortunately the local fish cannery is a major presence in the harbour.</li>
<li>Repair facilities and services for yachts in Pago Pago are quite limited. Until there is a marked improvement in yachting facilities, Pago Pago is best regarded as a convenient reprovisioning stop and nothing more. </li>
<li>Cruisers report that Pago Pago is populated by warm, friendly people who are hard working, devout family centered people.</li>

<div><p>The Samoans have embraced the American way of life wholeheartedly, which has led to a high standard of living compared to their neighbours, but also to increased crime, especially in the capital Pago Pago. This does not however tend to affect the cruising community.</p>
<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>) gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Please forward details of this incident to them, as theirs is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p></div>
