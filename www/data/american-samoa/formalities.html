<div><p>Pago Pago is the only Port of Entry in American Samoa and all yachts must clear in there before visiting elsewhere.</p>
<p><span>Notify the Harbour Master by using VHF Channel 16 prior to port arrival for port authorization. The Harbour is open 24-hours.</span></p>
<p>Ensure you have all the mandatory documents before entering port which include <span>Clearance from previous port, </span><span>Passport of everyone on board and V</span><span>essel Manifest.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Government Officials that <i>may</i> inspect your vessel upon arrival include <span>ASG-Customs, </span><span>ASG-Port and </span><span>ASG-Immigration.</span></p>
<p>On arrival in order to check-in, yachts can either anchor, or if arriving during normal hours (08:00-17:00 Monday to Friday) tie up at the tug dock at the container terminal. It is quite rough here however for a yacht. If anchoring, it can be difficult to get the anchor to hold.</p>
<p>If you arrive in the evening or at a weekend, yachts may anchor in the anchorage and fly the Q flag. You are then expected to dinghy to shore and visit the authorities during normal business hours.</p>
<p>The dinghy dock at the marina is open 06:00-18:00.</p>
<p>Clearing out can be done the same way, from anchor and dinghying ashore.</p>

<div><p>American Samoa is considered part of the United States, and US citizens can live and work there, but it has its own regulations regarding immigration.</p>
<p>All visitors (including US citizens) require a passport valid for 6 months.</p>
<p>Visitors who are permitted to enter, are granted a 30 day visa.</p>
<p>Citizens of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom do not require a visa and are granted a 30 day stay.</p>
<p>The 'official' position is that all other nationalities must apply for a visa in advance, but in practice, yacht crews with European passports will usually be granted a 30 day visa on arrival. (see comments below)</p>
<p>Most visas can be extended for an additional 30 days by applying to the <span>Attorney General's Office.</span></p>
<p>Non-US women who are more than six months pregnant will be refused entry as will nationals of more than 25 countries who do not have the personal approval of the Attorney General of American Samoa.</p>
<p>An exit permit is needed from Immigration. It is possible that passports may be held until departure.</p>

<div><p>Rose Island, the easternmost island of the Samoan archipelago, is a National Wildlife Refuge administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Honolulu. Permission from this service is needed to visit the island.</p>
<p>Traditional Samoan society is still bound by very strict customs and social codes of behaviour. The government issues an official list of behaviour codes for both Samoas. </p>
<p>Skimpy shorts or other revealing clothes should be avoided except when swimming or climbing coconut palms, although disapproval of shorts, if they are not too short, is on the wane. </p>
<p>In the early evening hours, even if swimming offshore, be sure to avoid making any noise that could interrupt the Samoans’ prayer period. Usually three gongs are sounded. The first is the signal to return to the house, the second is for prayer and the third sounds the all-clear. In some villages, swimming and fishing are forbidden on Sunday. </p>
