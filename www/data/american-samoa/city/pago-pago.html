<div class="hello"><div><p>Pago Pago is a popular long term port for liveaboards who report it is safe from hurricanes because of the high mountains around the harbour and therefore there's no need to undertake the rough passage to and from New Zealand for the season. The only real drawback is the cannery.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into American Samoa see the main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/AmericanSamoa?rc=Formalities">Formalities</a></strong> page.</p>
<p><span>Notify the Harbor Master by using VHF Channel 16 prior to port arrival for port authorization. The Harbor is open 24-hours.</span></p>
<p>The majority of yachts arriving here to check-in, drop anchor and dinghy ashore to complete the paperwork. It is however also possible to tie up at the tug dock in the container port if arriving between 0800 and 1700 (Mon-Fri). However conditions here are rather "rough" for a yacht.</p>
<p>If arriving outside office hours, anchor in the anchorage, fly the Q flag and then dinghy ashore during working hours.</p>
<p>Check in with the Port Capatain (who may also assign an anchoring place) and Customs (both offices are in the Container Port). Immigration is a short walk down the main road. If they are busy, advise them that you are from a yacht and you will be taken directly to the correct official.</p>
<p>A yacht must not be moved within the harbour without prior permission from the Port Captain. This includes going to get fuel from the fuel dock. When clearing out, the same procedure as for checking in can be followed.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour is well sheltered. There is a choice of berthing options. The marina is on the southern side of the harbour. The Harbour Master may be able to offer a mooring buoy but these should be carefully inspected before trusting your boat to them, or he may suggest a suitable anchoring spot.</p>
<p>It is important not to move the boat within the harbour (even to the fuel berth) without getting prior permission for the HM.</p>
<p><i>Anchorage</i></p>
<p>The holding in the harbour is poor and it is advisable to anchor with two anchors and not leave the yacht unattended for long periods. It is best to anchor a distance away from the cannery to avoid the occasional smells that are emitted when they open the pressure cookers. Long term resident yachts have moorings, so bear that in mind when anchoring nearby.</p>
<p>The best holding is between the small boat wharf and the the end of the bay, on the south side, in 35 to 80ft.</p>
<p>Dinghy landing is now more difficult since the dock near the Seaside Market has been fenced off and locked. The dock to the east is very crowded and is often also locked. There is a dinghy dock at the Malaloa Marina.</p>
<p>The fuel dock is available to vessels/yachts taking over 100 gallons of diesel. The draft at the fuel dock is 40 feet (12m), so it’s available at both high and low tide. It was recently dredged to increase the draft. More details under the<a class="external-link" href="Countries/AmericanSamoa/PagoPago?rc=MarineServices#Fuel"> <strong>fuel</strong></a> tab.</p>
