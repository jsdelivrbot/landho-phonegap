<ul>
<li>Norfolk Island is a delightful stop halfway between New Caledonia and New Zealand. It is an Australian Territory. Half the islands population are descendents from Pitcairn Island and the islanders warmly welcome visitors. </li>
<li>In NW–N–NE winds, Sydney Bay off Kingston (Southern side of the island) has a safe anchorage.</li>
<li>In fresh E winds when anchoring off Kingston is not possible due to the swell, Anson Bay offers the best anchorage now that the cable station has been decommissioned. </li>
<li>In SW winds Cascade Bay (Northern side of the island) offers the best protection and has an anchorage off the wharf where cargo is landed.</li>
<li>Ball Bay (South East side of the island) offers a sound anchorage in winds from the western quadrant with a boulder beach to land on. There is a road from the beach which is well travelled if you need to hitch a ride to town.</li>
<li>None can be regarded as all-weather anchorages, therefore the boat should never be left unattended and one should go ashore only in settled weather. Yachts have been lost at Norfolk Island through ignoring this warning. </li>
<li>It is also wise not to try and come into Kingston or any where near the island at night, as there are no lead lights or markers. There are some semi submerged rocks around close to the island, that can not be seen unless there is some white wash breaking around them. It is far safer to await daylight and work one's way in picking a deeper water aproach. </li>
