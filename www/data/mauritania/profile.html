<ul>
<li>Stretching along the west coast of Africa between Morocco and Senegal, a large part of Mauritania is the Sahara Desert. The republic is based on an Islamic socialist constitution and a traditional Muslim society, and does not particularly encourage tourism. </li>
<li>Its long coastline has very few natural harbours and the never-ending sandy beaches are its most remarkable feature. For those in search of solitude this might be sufficient attraction, but otherwise the country has very little to offer the cruising sailor.</li>
<li>The only repair facilities available are at Nouakchott where there is a shipyard which may take on work on a yacht in an emergency. Fuel is available in both ports and also some basic provisioning. </li>
<li>The security situation generally is not good, and the latest travel advisories should be checked before visiting the country.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Current security advice is to avoid "all but essential travel to the country". See the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/mauritania">www.fco.gov.uk</a> website.</p>
<p>There is a high risk of terror attacks. <span>There is a general threat of kidnap throughout Mauritania from these terrorist groups. There are currently several hostages being held in the region, some of whom have been held for over 3 years.</span></p>

<div><p>Most of the land has a harsh desert climate. The climate is better along the coast where the prevailing winds are northerly. The rainy season is from July to September, when it sometimes rains heavily. A strong swell is often felt along the coast from January to March.</p>
