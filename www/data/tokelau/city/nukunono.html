<div class="hello"><div><p>This, the largest of the atolls in Tokelau, lies in the middle of the group. Its lagoon is about 6 miles long and 4 miles wide. Unlike the other islands, which follow the Congregational church, the population on Nukunonu is Catholic. Sadly, the rinocerous beetle which attacks coconut trees, is now present here.</p></div></div>
