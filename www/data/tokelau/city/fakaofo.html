<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage due west of Fakaofo islet, but it is exposed to the SE tradewinds.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage, recommended by the islanders, is NW of the island, off Fenua Fala islet. The dinghy can be landed on the nearby beach, although a strong outboard engine may be needed to get through the surfline.</p>
<p><span>It has a store, a post office, internet and a clinic.</span></p></div></div>
