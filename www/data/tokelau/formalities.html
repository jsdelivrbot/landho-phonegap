<div><p>Yachts have to be cleared in by the police, Health and the Administration Officer. Officials normally come out to meet boats stopping at Fakaofo.</p>
<p>In spite of the strict regulations, boats appear to be allowed to make a short stop even if they arrive without prior permission. A cruising permit is required in advance but this rule does not appear to be strictly enforced for short visits.</p>

<div><p>The cruising permit must be authorised by the Council of Elders (taupulega) of each island that the yacht wishes to visit. In view of the difficulty of communicating with Tokelau, the Official Secretary at the Office for Tokelau Affairs in Apia, Western Samoa, can contact the Council of Elders concerned, on behalf of those seeking permits. He will radio the islands for permission. Every visitor must pass a simple physical examination to ascertain that he or she has no obvious illness.</p>
<p>There is no limit on how long a yacht may spend in Tokelau; however, the Council has the right to ask a yacht to leave if the island's culture, customs, rules or regulations are violated.</p></div>
