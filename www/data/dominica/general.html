<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit andcredit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p></div>
