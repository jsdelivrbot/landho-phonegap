This means you can electronically input all the necessary information from the boat by WiFi in advance.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note however that officers get rotated every 6 months creating a slight lag in updating the officers with the new SailClear system. Computer terminals to check-in via SailClear will soon be installed at both main ports of entry (Roseau &amp; Portsmouth). </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If requested, you can get your passport stamped at the Immigration office at the police station in town.</span></span></p>
<p>On arrival, ask for a cruising permit to cover all the places the yacht plans to visit. A cruising permit is needed to go from Roseau to Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Clearing in and out can be done at the same time if not planning to stay for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Working hours for the authorities are <span>Monday-Friday, 8:00-16:00 hrs.</span></p>

<div><p><span><strong>Mosquitos: Chikungunya disease in the Caribbean</strong><br/></span><span>The first case of the disease in the Caribbean was reported in the French island of St. Martin in 2013. Since then it has spread to several countries including Dominica and Saint Lucia. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea, and rash. Joint pain and stiffness are more common with chikungunya than with dengue fever. The symptoms appear between four to seven days after the bite of an infected mosquito. The majority of clinical signs and symptoms last three to 10 days, but joint pain may persist longer. Severe cases requiring hospitalisation are rare.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Dominica is an area of interest with reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p></div>
