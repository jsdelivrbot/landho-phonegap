<div class="hello"><div><p>The captain should go ashore to obtain clearance with Customs. The Customs station is located at the head of the commercial dock about half a mile south of the town.</p>
<p>Office hours are 0830-1300, 1400-1600 Tuesday to Friday (to 1700 Mondays). Outside of these hours there is a modest overtime charge. Normally the Customs office will pass on the paperwork to Immigration, so there will be no need to visit them unless instructed to do so.</p>
<p>Immigration is upstairs on the main street, Michael Douglas Blvd, opposite the dinghy dock.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Moorings</strong></p>
<p><span>Portsmouth Association of Yacht Services (<a class="external-link" href="http://dominicapays.wix.com/pays"><strong>P.A.Y.S</strong><strong>.</strong></a>) are based here. </span><span>This is a group </span><span>of trained certified guides and local businesses that also patrol the north end of Prince Rupert Bay at night during the winter sailing season (November to the end of May) and offer a number of services to cruising boats (formalities, ice, garbage, laundry, fuel, water etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>A new mooring field was installed in Prince Rupert Bay at the end of 2015.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>As you enter Prince Rupert Bay you will likely be approached by a PAYS member in their water taxi. They can be identified by the PAYS logo on their boat. </span><span>Alternatively, call them on VHF. Ch.16 and they will assist with tying up to their maintained moorings. </span></p>
<p><span>The PAYS office is located on Purple Turtle Beach in Prince Rupert’s Bay. They have an internet café and showers. </span><span>On Sundays they run a popular BBQ. PAYS accept USD,</span><span>EURO and GBP (British Pound Sterling). Their charge is EC$30.00 a night, including all the services above and the mooring.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><span>Prince Rupert Bay is a popular choice with yachts for anchoring, which is free. The holding is variable as some of the sand is mixed with coral rubble. Closer to the beach is generally the best holding.</span></p>
<p><span>Dominica P.A.Y.S staff are trying to monitor this area for yacht security, both during the daylight hours and overnigh. However, it's a very large bay, so please help them out by anchoring close to them</span><span><span> in the northernmost portion of Prince Rupert Bay, from the concrete fishing dock northward toward Purple Turtle. </span></span></p>
<p>Take care anchoring amidst the mooring buoys at the north end of the bay, and remember to allow 360 degrees of swing room to avoid entanglement with the markers.</p>
<p><span>Remember also that whilst you will see anchored boats all facing West during the day, when the western seabreeze stops at dusk, everyone turns back east overnight. Eastern squalls often blow through the anchorage during the night, so it's important that you set your anchor and chain correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>It is not advisable to anchor in the south of Prince Rupert Bay where yacht thefts and boardings have been reported.</span></span></p>
<p>Note that Wednesday and Saturday nights are “Loud music nights”, so best to moor further offshore if you prefer the quiet.</p>
<p><span>In addition, it is common for local children to play around the dinghy docks unsupervised, so take care when tying up your dinghy.</span></p>
<p>WiFi is available in the harbour - see comment below.</p>
