<div class="hello"><div><p>Roseau, the capital of Dominica, is on the west coast, towards the sothern tip of the island. It has some wonderfully attractive old buildings, many of which have been recently restored. The whole town has an authentic Caribbean atmosphere.</p>
<p><span>Roseau has most of the major tourist sites boasting the Boiling Lake, Ti Tou Gorge, Champagne Reef, Soufriere Pinnacle, Bubble Beach in Soufriere, Middle Ham Falls, Trafalgar Falls, Victoria Falls, Carib Indian Model Village, the Botanical Gardens, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 15° 17'05"N, 61° 22'38"W (anchorage)</span></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><span>The Dominica Marine Association and the Dominica Marine Center has been providing security in the Roseau bay area over the last 8 years. <span>A professional security dinghy makes daily rounds to ensure security and keep the peace. See the note by Chris Doyle at the bottom of the page about Marcus who runs the dinghy.</span></span></p>
<p>There has not been any problems with theft from yachts here in recent years, and the locals have been working very heard to improve security for yachts. <span>Dominica is now the model for the other islands when it comes to safety for yachts and its occupants.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The Customs office is on the north side of the new ferry terminal, located just north of the cruise ship dock. The office is usually open Monday 08:00-13:00,14:00-17:00, Tuesday-Friday 08:00-13:00, 14:00-16:00. Sometimes the office is also open Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons. Availability does depend on the ferry schedule. Overtime fees apply on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to visit the Immigration offace as Customs will pass on the paperwork. Your passport will not be stamped.</p>
<p>There is a two week "in/out" clearance available upon request.</p>
<p>To move your vessel to one of the other three ports, requires a 24 hour cruising permit. This can be obtained in Roseau or Portsmouth.</p>
<p>The only fee associated with Clearance is a 10EC Environmental Fee.</p>
<p>Alternatively, clear in at the deepwater port north of Roseau. Although posted as opening at 9am, Customs officials at the commercial dock structure their time to accommodate commercial vessels and are inconsistent for the general public.</p>
<p>See the <a href="Countries/Dominica?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Dominica/Formalities</strong></a> page for full details on clearing into and out of Dominica, and information regarding the use of the SeaClear system.</p>
