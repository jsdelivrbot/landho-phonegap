<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is on the southern side of the island Hainan, approximately 500nm SW of Hong Kong. This is China's most southerly province, and from April 2011 permits foreign boats to remain in the area for 183 days a year. See Clearance below for more details.</p>
<p>Hainan Island itself is not far from Vietnam, and with the Paracel Islands close by is a very attractive cruising ground. The islands consist of over 130 small coral islands, sandbanks and reefs divided into two groups. The Amphitrite Group consists of six low, narrow islands with sand cays, shallow lagoons and reefs, and the Crescent Group consists of eight islands forming a crescent-like structure enclosing a stunning deep, central lagoon.</p>
