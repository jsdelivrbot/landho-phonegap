<div class="hello"><div><p>Xiamen is regarded as China's cleanest, most beautiful, seaport city. It is located on the south eastern coast of Fujian Province. The surrounding countryside offers spectacular scenery and pleasant tree-lined beaches. The  Buddhist Nanputao Temple, dating back to the Tang Dynasty, is definately worth a visit.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>With an invitation from a local yacht club and a good agent it is possible, at a cost, to sail to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Upon arrival it is likely you will be asked to anchor where the commercial vessels have to anchor just by the Special Economic Zone. You will not be able to move and will have to use official pilot boats to get to/from the shore at US$150/trip. The Anchorage is exposed to waves, traffic and wind. However, your agent may be able to negotiate a move to the marina.</p>

<p>The Iron Rock Yacht Club and the new two year old marina in Wuyan Bay, are about 15 NM north of the commercial anchorage on the northeastern part of Xiamen Island. To get into the bay where the marina is situated one has to pass under a bridge, 24 meter high during low tide and 16-18 meter on high tide. </p>
<p>The marina has space for about 40 yachts, almost all of them powerboats and not many guest berths. There are plans to extend the marina, which is government owned, in the coming years. In the marina there are facilities for yacht clubs, one restaurant and many dealers for yachts and equipment. The local Beneteau dealer is said to be very helpful and friendly.</p>
