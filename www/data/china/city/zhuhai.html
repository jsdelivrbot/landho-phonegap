<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Zhuhai is situated in the southwest of Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province. It went from a forgotten fishing village in the eighties to a rapidly expanding city of about 1.5 million today. This is still small by Chinese standards, but it's growing daily. It has immaculately manicured parks and is one of the greenest cities in China. Sadly, the sea around it is badly affected by the silt and pollution of the Pearl River.</span></p>
<p><span>It lies just north of Macau and west of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 22° 16'23"N, 113° 36'0"E.</span></p></div></div>
