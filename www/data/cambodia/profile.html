<li>Cambodia is bordered by Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and has a coastline on the Gulf of Thailand. The capital, Phnom Penh, is located at the confluence of the Mekong, Tonle Sap and Bassac rivers.</li>
<li>The start of the 21st century has seen much more political stability for the country after decades of unrest and bloodshed, marked by a slow increase in tourism. Tourism is largely land-based, with only a few yachts sailing there from neighbouring Thailand.</li>

<p>Hotspots for petty crime include the riverfront and BKK areas of Phnom Penh, and the beaches and tourist areas of Sihanoukville. In 2013, the British Embassy has received a larger number of crime reports from British nationals in Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Cambodia remains heavily affected by landmines and unexploded ordnance. Mined areas are often unmarked.  Don’t stray off main routes in rural areas, including around temple complexes.</p>
