24/11/2013 VE all formalities checked/updated. Security info from FCO added.
15/12/2013 VE details of clearance from cruisers Karin and Tony Stubbs (shipambernectar@gmail.com) who cleared in at Ko Khong.
15/06/2015 SR Updated formalities with info from Rony of sailcambodia@yahoo.com. Also confirmed with shipping agency there. Turns out KK no longer accepts yachts for clearance so Sik. is the only place. If it changes, Rory will let us know. E visa is possible for Sik. although gov. site says it is not. Got info. on local weekly visa for $5 that is just for the Sik area - but sounds dodgy so haven't put it on the site.
