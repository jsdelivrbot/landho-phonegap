<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Khao Kong</span> lies a short distance south of the border with Thailand (not to be confused with the island of <span>Kho Kong a few miles south of the town)</span>. This is a relatively undeveloped part of the country and the city previously had the reputation of being a 'wild west' type of town. To the south lies the Peam Krasaop wildlife sancturary.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>In 2015 rules have changed for visiting yachts and it's no longer possible to clear into or out of Cambodia here. All clearance must take place in <b><a class="external-link" href="../sihanoukville">Sihanoukville</a></b>.</p>

<!--
OLD INFO. HIDDEN 15 JUNE 2015 FOR USE IF THIS BECOMES A CLEARANCE PORT AGAIN FOR YACHTS:
On arrival, anchor off the Cafe Laurent.
It is necessary to use the agent preferred by the Immigration office. Take your papers to the Kampuchea Shipping Agency Brokers (KAMSAB) at the Asian Hotel, opposite the Café Laurent. The agent, Kith Songy, will then call Immigration and report your arrival.
Then, either rent a motorbike (5 US $ a day) or take a tuk-tuk and go to the Customs and Immigration offices at the border across the toll bridge (15 minutes). There, Immigration will stamp your passport (it is best to have an e-visa ready, 2 copies) and fingerprint you digitally. 
Customs will just stamp your exit papers (zarpe) from the previous country with an inbound stamp.
You then return the (stamped) clearance paper to the agent.
It may be that just giving your clearance papers to the KAMSAB agency is sufficient.
If you know your departure date, the agent will give you the clearance papers for that date and you pay him his fee (US$ 100 in Dec 2013). It is also necessary to visit the Immigration office. If the KAMSAB agency does this for you, it will cost much more.
If you do not know your departure date, it will be necessary to return to Koh Kong to pay the agent and collect your papers.
