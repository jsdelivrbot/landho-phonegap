<p>Marina Oceania opened in November 2013 and is well protected by a breakwater. It is located in the inner harbour of Sihanoukville Seaport <i>(see photo provided by the marina)</i>.</p>
<p>The marina is keen to provide a professional service to visiting yachts and hopes to expand to include a shipyard and yachting services at some point in the future.</p>
<p>The marina is small (20 boats) and built with equipment from Europe. T<span>ransfers to the city by car and ferry are available (10-15 minutes to the city center and the main shops and markets).</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Small repairs are possible in the marina, such as underwater hull cleaning, ultrasonic scraper etc. </span><span>Repairs on the beach are possible by two local shipyards nearby.</span></p>
