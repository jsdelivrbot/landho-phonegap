<div><p>Whilst there are 2 clearance ports in Cambodia, Koh Kong and Sikhanoukville, in 2015 it appears that yachts can only clear into and out of the country at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cambodia/sihanoukville">Sikhanoukville</a></strong>. A pity, as Koh Kong is much closer to the Thai border.</p>
<p>The days of there being no costs for cruising here (other than<span> "tea money" for officials) are also gone (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cambodia?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong>), and it is mandatory to use the state shipping agency in Sikhanoukville for clearance.</span></p>
<p>A visiting yacht must present the boat registration papers, clearance papers from the last port, and have a 30 day tourist visa for all crew and passengers. Arrival without a visa will result in the passport/s being sent to Phnom Phen at a cost of $500USD. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cambodia?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Immigration</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p>Formalities must be done through the Kampuchea shipping agency (KAMSAB), who are located in <span>Sikhanoukville </span>across the sea beach road at Victory beach, on the bottom floor of the Windmill Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>KAMSAB</strong><br/>Ph: 855 (0) 34 934 197<br/><a href="mailto:kamsab-shv@online.com.kh" target="_blank">kamsab-shv@online.com.kh</a> <br/><a class="external-link" href="http://www.kamsab.com.kh/">http://www.kamsab.com.kh/</a></p>
<p><span>It is recommended to contact the agent via e-mail or phone in advance of arrival. The agent can also help with visa issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Entrance and exit fees vary depending on the size of the yacht and the captains negotiating skills. S<span>ee </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cambodia?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a> for more details.</p>

<div><p><strong>Tourist Visas</strong></p>
<p><span>Crew arriving in Cambodia on board a yacht must have a 30 day tourist visa. Arriving without a visa will result in your passport being sent to Phnom Phen at a cost of $500USD.</span></p>
<p>Electronic tourist visas can be obtained online for US$37 or at the nearest Cambodian Embassy. Whilst the government website states that Sihanoukville does not accept e-visas, KAMSAB have assured noonsite that they are accepted. Prior to sailing to Cambodia, it is a good idea to make contact with <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.kamsab.com.kh/overview.html"><strong>KAMSAB</strong></a></strong> and check current regulations.</p>
<p>For a list of Cambodian Embassies see <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/Cambodian-Mission.aspx">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span>For more information see <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/"><strong>https://www.evisa.gov.kh/</strong></a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tourist visas issued by a Royal Cambodian Embassy abroad may appear to have a longer validity than 1 month. The validity of the visa refers to time you have to enter Cambodia. The visa is valid for 30 days from the actual date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival, and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you’ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements. You can be fined, detained and deported if you overstay your visa.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Extension</strong></p>
<p><span>The 30 day tourist visa can be extended for a further 30 days only. To stay longer you must leave the country and either return again on a new tourist visa, or, return on a business visa which can be extended up to 3 or 6 months or 1 year. You cannot apply for a business visa until the tourist visa has expired or been stamped out (of the country). </span></p>
<p><span>Extensions or Business Visas can be handled through most travel agents in Sihanoukville and through KAMSAB. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cambodia/sihanoukville?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices">General Services</a></strong> for listings.</span></p>
<p><span>Passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months.</span></p>
