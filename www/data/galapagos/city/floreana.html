<div class="hello"><div><p>Floreana, also known as Charles or Santa Maria Island, is the southeasternmost island in the archipelago. It is one of the smaller of the major islands, with an area of 173 km² and a maximum altitude of 640 metres. It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history and one of the earliest to be inhabited.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Floreana is more of an “out-island” as it does not have a scheduled ferry service and you must visit as part of an excursion, or go on your own with a 5 port autographo. Note that not all agents "allow" a visit to Floreana, and those that do insist that cruisers promise to adhere to the strict rules and regulations, which have been abused by previous generations of cruisers.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach is straightforward and yachts can anchor in 45 ft depth outside the moored boats, south of the wharf and port captain’s office, and near to Black Beach.</p>
<p>Described as a “reasonably protected harbour”, Puerto Velasco Ibarra is open to the west and can be very rolly.</p>
<p><span>There is now wifi available here which is reported to be very good. There is an open unlocked site and a locked site for which the authorities freely provide the password. </span></p>
