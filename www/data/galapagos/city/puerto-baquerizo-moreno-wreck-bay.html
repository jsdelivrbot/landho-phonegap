<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Baquerizo Moreno is the capital of the Galapagos. It is located along the southwestern coast of San Cristóbal, the easternmost island in the archipelago and consequently is a popular choice with cruisers for clearing in as the closest port to the mainland.</p>
<p>Tour boats come and go frequently as does the fuel supply boat, so ensure you keep clear of their routes.</p>
<p>Sea lions are problematic. Do not leave your dinghy in the water tied to the boat - it will be colonised.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full information on Clearance into the Galapagos see the main </span><a href="../?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Clearance Page</strong></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>During busy periods it can take up to a couple of days before you see your agent. Noonsite strongly advises selecting an agent in advance and keeping in e-mail contact with that agent during passage to ensure they can attend you on arrival. <span>Whilst Noonsite does not recommend any particular agent, all the agents listed on noonsite have been recommended by cruisers at one time or another (see </span><a href="../?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>here)</strong>.</a><span> It can be useful to look at reports from cruisers for their various experiences (see adjacent).</span></span></p>
<p>It is necessary to go ashore for Immigration (which does not require an agent), however most agents include immigration in their fees. Procedures are reported to be simple. Any taxi (dual cab 4wd utility vehicle) can take you there and wait for you to finish for US$2 return. You will need colour copies of the passports and ships papers, the taxi will know where to get them. Take your crew with you.</p>
<p>There are now water taxis ($1 per person per ride). Call taxi aquatico on VHF channel 14, and have a row of fenders ready. They are good and friendly.</p>
<p>The Port Captain is located to your right on the beach facing the anchorage.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p>Stay clear of the SE point. Come in midway between the North point of land, which has a lighthouse on it and the northernmost of 2 tall, white/yellow, lighted buoys, with a short red one in the middle. The red buoy marks a wreck or pinnacle and the waves break quite high near it, so be aware and stay clear. Also, don’t come too close to the lighthouse point, as there is a big surf break there and shallow water.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="../../galapagos-pics/galapagos_san-cristobal_warc16/@@images/image/preview"/>Anchorage</strong></p>
<p>The anchorage at Baquerizo Moreno offers reasonable protection. It is likely you will be requested to anchor in the NE quadrant of the harbour with the old cement cannery pier to your north and Playa Man to your east. Good holding sand bottom but with big rocky patches which show up from the deck in 30’ clear water. No stern anchor required.</p>
<p>Yachts with open transoms should put something to block access to their cockpits if they don't want a (smelly) pet sealion. Loud noises will encourage a seal to leave. They will bark if you get too close. It is a warning that they will bite if you get any closer.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong></p>
<p>It is not a requirement to use a water taxi to get ashore, but as there is a ground swell that makes beach landings difficult and the seal population that live around the floating pontoon at the wharf will sleep in your dinghy, it is easier to pay the $1 taxi fee per person. After 6pm the price goes up until they stop running around 10-11pm. Locals pay the same price.</p>
<p>Driver expertise varies so ask around as to who might best protect your topsides. Call them on VHF Ch.14 or simply whistle and wave them down as they pass. Put a couple of fenders down to save your gelcoat whilst boarding.</p>
<p><strong>Rubbish Disposal </strong><br/> Only waste for recycling can be left on the islands. This is not collected from boats and must be taken by taxi to the recycling centre and paid to be disposed of.
