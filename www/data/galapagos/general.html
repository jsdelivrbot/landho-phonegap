<p>US$ are accepted.</p>
<p><span>All official expenses have to be paid in “cash” on the islands, paying with a Credit Card is not an option. Shops rarely take credit cards and they will add an extra % for using one - up to 14 %! Bring plenty of one-dollar and five-dollars bills to pay taxis and small purchases.</span></p>
<p>There are ATMs available on several of the largest islands. Most permit a <span>maximum withdrawl of 600 dollars per 24h per card.</span></p>
<p>Note, that it is not possible for foreigners to get cash on Isla Isabela. Whilst there are 2 banks here, they do not have ATMs and it's not possible to get cash from the counter using a credit card. If this is your last stop for re-provisioning prior to the Pacific crossing, go prepared.</p></div>

<div><p>International Dialing Code for Galapagos is +593.</p>
<p>Internet is problematic but available. In the main painfully slow.</p>
<p>Lots of internet cafes, some work better than others. Charges about $1-2 per hour.</p>
<p>One can buy a 3G - 4G Data connection SIM cards for I-phone or latest model IPad air at the main CNT office (Ecuadorian national phone company). They sell special priced SIM cards for tourists. Ask your agent.</p>
<p>This system will work better than any Internet place and will work on your vessel in the harbour.</p>
<p>Reports from cruisers are that other providers, such as “Claro”, are used by too many people and do not work well.</p>
<p><span>Local simcards such as Digicel &amp; Calor, can easily be bought in San Cristobal and Santa Cruz.</span></p>
