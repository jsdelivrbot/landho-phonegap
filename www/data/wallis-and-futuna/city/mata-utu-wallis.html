<div class="hello"><div><p>Wallis Island is about 300nm west of Samoa and is rarely visited by cruising  yachts, hence there is little tourism. Entry is through the pass, off the south west corner of the island. It is simple at slack  water and most, but not all, of the lagoon markers shown on French chart 6876 were  standing in August 2012. Proceed to the main settlement of Mata Utu.</p>
<p><strong>May 2015:</strong> Wallis Radio monitors VHF channel 16. Michel Soûla is no longer there.</p>
<p>Position 13° 23'42"S, 176° 13'11"W (entrance to the pass)</p>
<p><span>Position 13° 17'07"S, 176° 10'05"W (wharf at <span>Mata Utu)</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For details on Customs and Immigration rules for Wallis, see the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/WallisandFutuna?rc=Formalities" target="_blank">main  formalities page</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The captain should proceed ashore and check in first with the Gendarmerie who  handle immigration. They generally want to see each crew member with their  passport at their office, just above the harbour and past the post office. It is  usually manned.</p>
<p>The Customs office for small boat reporting is on the dock.  Customs, is open Monday-Friday from 0700 until 1330, except for Thursday: 1330- 1700.</p>
<p>Both must be visited again on departure even if visiting another island in the group.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For clearing Customs and re-provisioning, the anchorage just south of the Mata Uta wharf is much more convenient to town. Cruisers recommend anchoring at                 13 17.280S, 176 10.100 W in 8 metres, which is within easy distance to a dinghy  landing and steps on the inside of the south side of the wharf.</p>
<p>Gahi Bay provides a more protected anchorage for longer stays and is most  popular with yachts. One should ask the local chief for permission to anchor in  the Bay.</p>
<p>One of the most secure, protected and beautiful anchorages in the lagoon is in  the lee of Ile Faioa at 13 22.940 S, 176 10.460 W. There is easy dinghy access  ashore and great beach walks on this uninhabited islet. If entering the pass too  late in the day to make the transit to Mata Uta anchorage off the commercial  wharf, this could be an alternative.</p>
<p>In settled weather it is possible to anchor off the islands to the east of Mata  Utu, but take care not to foul your tackle on coral heads. Only the east side of  the main islands Ile Uvea, is navigable.</p>
