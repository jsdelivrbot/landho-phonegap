<div class="hello"><div><p>The small harbour of Leava offers shelter in all winds except SE-SW, although the swell is constant. Several boats have come to grief on the coral reef in the harbour so one has to be careful anchoring with plenty of scope and swinging room is important.</p>
<p><span>The alternate anchorage is off Alofi island, in the channel.</span></p>
