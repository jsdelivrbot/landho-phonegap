<div><ul>
<li>Wallis and Futuna are two island groups separated by 150 miles of ocean in the central South Pacific. They are a Territorial Collective (Collectivité d’Outre-Mer) of France. Lying west of Samoa and slightly off the route to Fiji, Wallis and Futuna are not often visited by cruising yachts. </li>
<li>The pass into the lagoon at Wallis is relatively easy to negotiate and there are several anchorages, the most popular and best protected being at Gahi Bay. There are also several small islets in the lagoon which can be used as day anchorages. </li>
<li>Ashore one can come in contact with a relatively unspoilt Polynesian society where the rule of the traditional Polynesian chieftain, the Lavelua, still commands more respect than the French administration. The singing and dancing of the Wallisians is vigorous and one of the few places where traditional songs have not been changed by missionary influences.</li>
<li>A similar atmosphere survives on the smaller Futuna, which does not have a protected lagoon, but only an anchorage at Sigave Bay on the west coast.</li>
