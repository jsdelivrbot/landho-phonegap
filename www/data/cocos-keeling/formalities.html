<p>All customs duties are carried out by the Australian Federal Police on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</p>
<p><strong>On Approach</strong></p>
<p>When approaching the 12 mile limit, vessels should call "Cocos Police" on VHF Channel 20 advising them of your arrival.</p>
<p>If you do not have an AIS transponder, it is possible you will be called up by a <span>Border Control vessel before reaching the 12 mile limit as this area is regularly patrolled. It is still necessary to call <span> "Cocos Police" on VHF Channel 20.</span></span></p>
<p>Be prepared to answer questions about location, ETA to the anchorage, number of persons / weapons / animals on board etc. There is a 24/7 watch on Channel 20, keep calling every 30 minutes until answered.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Incoming vessels must fly the Q flag and anchor in the lagoon behind Direction Island. Contact the Police on Channel 20 once anchored and they will advise you on clearnace procedures. No one on board should leave the vessel nor should there be any contact with anyone until clearance is completed. The buoys at Direction Island are not suitable for yachts, please anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: Cocos Keeling entrance</strong><br/> The GPS position of the entrance into the lagoon, west of Direction Island, is reported not to accord with most charts, both paper and electronic (However, see comment below). Entrance to the lagoon of South Keeling is between Horsburgh Island and Direction Island. The entrance pass to the atoll is deep, wide, and well lit.</p>
<p>There are now (unlit) buoys leading into the yacht anchorage at Direction Island. Anyone arriving in the dark might be best advised to anchor in a convenient area outside the yacht anchorage until daylight. Be aware that the supply ship often arrives at night and will anchor in the area of the entrance range lights.</p>
<p><strong>Formalities</strong></p>
<p>Customs, Immigration and quarantine are on West Island. Usually, a single police officer will come by small boat and will do the quarantine, immigration and customs clearances. Port fees need to be paid on Home Island.</p>

<div><p>The same strict immigration requirements apply as in mainland Australia and no one is allowed to arrive without a valid Australian visa, except holders of New Zealand passports. Visas are usually available online.</p>
<p>See the <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.border.gov.au/">Australian Department of Immigration &amp; Border Protection</a> </strong>website for more information.</p>
<p>The quarantine requirements are not the same as for the Australian mainland and are very relaxed.</p>
<p>Yachts travelling to or from Cocos Keeling and the mainland of Australia are deemed to have not left Australia if their trip is within 30 days of departure from the mainland Australia or these islands. Persons on board these yachts must ensure that their visa covers the entire period of their stay including travel time between the mainland of Australia and these islands.</p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared on arrival and must not leave the vessel without a permit.</p>
<p>Restricted goods may be bonded on board.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine:</strong><br/> Fresh eggs, their containers and some meat products may be confiscated, or sealed on board. If a yacht has animals on board, it must anchor outside the quarantine buoy at Direction Island. Animals must not be taken ashore.</p>
<p>Under the new quarantine regime for the Indian Ocean Territories, all fresh fruit and vegetables may only be imported from AUSTRALIA if free of pests and diseases. No fresh fruit and vegetables is allowed to be imported from other countries including CHRISTMAS ISLAND. The products must also be clean and free of soil or other contamination. Quarantine officers will be required to inspect fresh fruit and vegetables on arrival.</p>
<p>However, the quarantine requirements are much more relaxed than for the Australian mainland and, in practice, it is unlikely that any food will be confiscated.</p>
<p>There is no longer any facilities for disposing of waste or garbage in Cocos Keeling and cruisers must take it all away with them.</p>
