<div class="hello"><div><p>Direction Island lies 1.5NM north of Home Island.</p>
<p>It is advisable to follow the channel markers when moving between Direction Island and Home Island as there are numerous shallow areas and coral outcrops along the route.</p>
<p>Whilst Direction Island has nothing ashore, this is where the main yacht anchorage is located.</p>
<p>Position 12°05′16″S, 096°52′55″E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Holding in the anchorage is good, there is not much shelter from the SE Winds, but there is little swell in the lagoon.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several shelters along the edge of the beach. Two of which have large rain-water butts attached which store the roof run-off. Also, t</span><span>here are toilets ashore, with toilet paper provided.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a WiFi router in the main shelter where you can sign up for internet online and pay by credit card. The connection is not fast but is useable from the anchorage.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>No garbage can currently be disposed of anywhere in Cocos Keeling. Yachts must take everything away with them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Mosquitoes are a real problem on Direction Island (although this tends to be seasonal); bring plenty of bug spray!</span></span></span></p>
