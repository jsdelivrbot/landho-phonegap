<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Robinson Crusoe Island is the larges island in the Juan Fernandez group. Its town, Juan Bautista was severely damaged by a tsunami in 2010.</span></p>
<p>Cumberland Bay lies on the northern side of the Island and is the usual anchorage as it is opposite the town. About 600 people live here and lobster fishing is a major occupation.</p>
<p>Position 33° 38'16"S, 78° 49'37"W (anchorage).</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>New buoys were placed in Cumberland Bay courtesy of the Higuerillas Yacht Club in April 2014, however a report September 2014 claims that the buoys are no longer present.</p>
<p>The anchorage is very rolly and crowded with small fishing boats, so that swinging room is limited. <span>The swell can often be fairly significant and a stern anchor is then advisable. </span><span>The bay is unsafe in a northerly gale and one should be prepared to leave at short notice.</span></p>
<p>The village has a post office, wireless station, and there is an airstrip on the west end. Daily flights in summer to Santiago, subject to demand.</p>
<p>An amazing place to visit and the people extremely friendly. Plenty to do.</p>
