<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour provides very good shelter and has done so since Roman times.</p>
<p><span>There are two harbours in Ventotene. </span></p>
<p><span>The new one (Calla Rossano) is also the ferry harbour and there is a swimming dock off the sailing club.</span></p>

<p><span>The </span><span>other much older harbour (over 2000 years old) </span><span>is called Porto Vecchio or Porto Nicola, and was built by slaves. Boats up to </span><span>45ft can berth bows-to the quay here. There is a depth of approx. 2.20m. Don't however berth stern-to the quay as it shallows quickly with only about 1m of water next to the quayside. There is electricity and water on the quay.</span></p>

<p>It is possible to anchor outside the port and there are also several anchorages around the island.</p>
