<div class="hello"><div><p>Probably the best berthing option, is the marina at San Pocco which is about half a mile to the west of the harbour of Muggia.</p>
<p>The yacht club has a few berths on the western side of the harbour. Fishing and local boats occupy the inner pontoons.</p>
<p>There may be space by the HM office at the root of the N. breakwater.</p>
<p>Sheltered for all directions, but winds from the west can cause a swell to enter.</p>
