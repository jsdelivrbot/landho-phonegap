<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-right" src="../../../resolveuid/2dd27cebc359440495d5cc0432048c81/@@images/image/preview"/>There are several small pontoons in the harbour and help is offered for mooring. <span>It is however shallow draught here and if your boat needs more than 1.80m of water, you will likely have a problem. </span></p>
<p>It is also possible to berth overnight on the port side of the harbour next to the small orange lighthouse (<i>see photo courtesy of Berthold Notthoff who visited in 2015</i>). However tying up here can only be done from 17:00 - 08:00 and then you must leave. There is no water or electricity here.</p>
<p>There is also room to anchor, with care, at Ponza town, or in one of the many bays around the island.</p>
