<div class="hello"><div><p>There is berthing in the modern marina and in the old port; anywhere space can be found! The e<span>ntrance to marina Porto Maurizio is opposite the Old Town port entrance. Once you are inbetween them you can choose to either turn E =&gt; for Old Town (&amp; fueling station) or W =&gt; Porto Maurizio.</span></p>
<p><span><span> The Old Town port seems to be popular with large Motor Yachts wintering there, probably because it is cheaper berthing than in the marina. There is a fuel berth here.</span></span></p>
<p>It is quite a stiff climb up to the town centre from the old port, but well worth the effort.</p>
<p><span>Provisioning and supplies are rather sparse, with only one Supermarket (Carrefour) about half an hour walk from the marina, and a store for nautical supplies half way to the Supermarket (plus another one on the Old Town Main Quay). There are s</span><span>ome good Bars, Restaurants, Cafe's within close walking distance.</span></p>

      Entrance to the marina is easy with plenty of depth (still 5m of water close to the boatyard). Facilities are basic (Shower, Toilet) with Water and Electricity available at all berths. Staff are friendly and helpful. The marina is well sheltered and security is good.<br>
The marina boatyard has a crane, as well as a 40 ton travel hoist.
