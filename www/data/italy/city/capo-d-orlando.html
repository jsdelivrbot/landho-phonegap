<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour, on the northern coast of Sicily, is a good place to stop for smaller yachts before making the run into the Messina Straits. It offers reasonable shelter, but is open to the East and subject to swell in strong NE winds.</p>
<p>Latest reports (see comments at bottom of page) are that the harbour is closed.</p>
<p>Eighteen miles east of Orlando, is the modern marina of <strong><a href="Countries/Italy/Portorosa">Portorosa</a></strong></p>
<p>Position 38° 09'24"N, 14° 46'30"E (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Navigation in the Harbour</b><br>
There are a couple of pairs of buoys marking the channel once you are around the mole, but there is a large sand bank visible extending SW of the mole, almost closing off the W part of the harbour. This can be crossed with care (if necessary) but depths are less than 2m.  </br></p>
<p>The fuel berth at the W end of the harbour is unavailable to yachts, however there is a dredger operating here (moored on the E side of the harbour), so the situation may change.  </p>
<p>Larger boats may find manoeuvring in this harbour difficult due to the restricted depth and confined spaces.</p>
<p><b>Berthing</b><br>
Pontoons are present, some have broken up, but others are useable.  Lazy lines are tailed to the pontoons but some are close to the surface and most are of dubious quality so care is needed. It should be possible to go alongside. Electricty and water points are installed on the pontoons but do not work. There are no other facilities in the harbour, however the town has everything it should.  </br></p>
<p>In April, much of the harbour seemed closed. You may or may not be charged depending on the local "ormeggiatori".</p>
