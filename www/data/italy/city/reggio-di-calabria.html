<div class="hello"><div><p>Reggio di Calabria lies at the southern tip of the Italian peninsula on the eastern shore of the Strait of Messina.</p>
<p>This is a commercial harbour and busy with ferries to and from Sicily. Although this is the biggest port in this area, little has been done to this town since the last earthquake in 1980 and it has a rather impoverished air. Fuel by jerry can is available here.</p>
<p>Take note of the tides when planning to enter this harbour as the streams between Sicily and the mainland can be strong and can cause quite heavy seas. Another hazard to be aware of is the number of pots and fishing lines laid to the south of the harbour. This makes a night approach unadvisable.</p>
<p>Position 38°07'N,15°39'E.</p>
<p><i>Saline Joniche Marina, about 20nm south of Reggio di Calabria, has been reported as no longer accessible (July 2011) due to a shingle bank being thrown up by winter storms.</i></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/>Note that no anchoring is permitted in the Strait of Messina. If anchoring in case of emergency, be sure to report where you drop the hook to avoid large fines. Read the <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.capitaneriediporto.it/servizi/documents/manualivts/manualeutentemessina_inglese.pdf">VTS Messina Strait User Manual </a></strong>for more information.</p>
<p>The Capitaneria at Reggio has enacted its own specific legislation in relation to anchoring off beaches in the area. The actual requirement is that <strong>yachts must anchor at least 150m offshore</strong> of beaches reserved for bathing between 0800 &amp; 2000. Whilst this is not unreasonable, there is unfortunately no way of telling whether a beach has been reserved for bathing without going ashore and finding a notice (and they are not easy to find). There seems to be no register online.</p>
<p>The following documents are translations of the relevant orders published by the Reggio de Calabria Port Captain that cover this issue:<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/images/pdfs/italy_reggio-calabria_order-29/view">Order 29</a></b> - Provisions governing recreational sports activities and bathing.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/images/pdfs/italy_reggio-calabria_order-35/view">Order 35</a></b>, Article 2 - anchoring in bathing zones.</p>
<p>Many updated charts and pilot books have no mention of this legislation.</p>
<p>Last updated July 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Berthing</strong></p>
<p>The yacht harbour, in the northern corner of the harbour, is run by Lega Navale Italiana. Boats moor on the part of the quay marked "Yachts in Transit". Staff have no English but are helpful and friendly. The port office is on the south side of the harbour. It is reported to be expensive (charged €40 a night for a 10m yacht in April 2012).</p>
<p>It is possible to moor to the east wall but it might not be possible to remain  there more than one night.</p>
<p>The ferries create quite a wash and the swell can enter the harbour. Good fenders are advisable and be sure to leave plenty of distance to the quay.  New lazy lines were fitted in early 2012. It is a noisy port as the main road and railway line run just behind the berths. The water is filthy and the port stinks of sewage.</p>
<p>There is a small supermarket out of the port and up the road to the left.  This is a dirty and risky walk as the traffic speeds past in this area.  There is a small chandlery and engine machine shop across the road from the port, which could be useful in an emergency.</p>
