<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of the development works on-going at the harbour entrance.</p>
<p>There are three small docks at the far southern end of the commercial harbour that offer berthing for visiting yachts (Darsena Romana  and Darsena Traianea Nord are the most suitable). They are currently being upgraded to attractive marinas (along with the surrounding). The advantage is that they are close to the city. There are plans to open an entrance for yachts at this southern end of the port.</p>
<p>There is also a large modern marina about 2nm south of the entrance to the commercial docks on the edge of the city.</p>
<p>If planning to find a suitable place for a long-term berth or to layup for the winter, then the attractive old fishing port of Santa Marinella, 4nm further south is a good option.</p>
