<div class="hello"><div><p>Located on the southern coast of Sicily, the town of Licata has a new, full facility marina, which makes this a very nice option for wintering in Italy. There is also a boat<span>yard in the western basin with a large, well maintained travel lift working with both commercial and recreational boats.</span></p>
<p>It is most definitely not a tourist destination, but a typical Sicilian town with good shoreside services and a liveaboard cruising community that is slowly becoming established. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="../sicily-licata-good-new-marina">this report</a></strong> for comments from cruisers.</p>
<p><span>The historical centre of the town dates from the Byzantine period and there is some interesting architecture here. There are also a number of beautiful small beaches along the coast.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ragusa, 30 miles to the East, has a much larger and more active liveaboard community if that is what you are looking for.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The marina is located in the large harbour of Licata, and is well </span><span>protected by long, overlapping breakwaters. This is a modern, </span><span>first-class marina with excellent facilities in beautifully landscaped grounds. <span>The Marina office is situated on the quayside and is open 24/7 and the staff are reported to be very helpful and friendly.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The marina currently has 325 berths. <span>There are shops and cafes around the marina and a brand new housing complex. There is also a small beach, very safe for children.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The marina is a 15 minute walk from the main town square. Within a short bike ride one can get to all the </span><span>desired services of a live-aboard - shops, hardware stores, </span><span>restaurants, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Marina staff will take you to and from the station for buses to Catania (135 mins, every 2 - 3 hours, 9 EUR) or to Palermo (165 mins, every 4 hours, 9 EUR) and they will help actively with shopping in the town, if you do not find your item in the 100 m nearby shopping mall (with an excellent supermarket).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Some cruisers have reported that </span><span> fouling is particularly bad over the winter here, due to large amounts of nutrients coming down the river. This will of course depend on how often you get your boat antifouled but also the </span><span>type of anti-fouling paint. The marina offers a bottom-cleaning service by diver, at a reasonable rate. There have also been reports of poor security (see comments at bottom of page). </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Repair service and haulout can be arranged at the commercial harbour </span><span>next to the marina. <span>As of this Autumn, the Oceanica Naval Cantiere reports to be able to lift out even 9m wide catamarans with their new travelling overhead gantry on order. </span></span></span></span></p>
