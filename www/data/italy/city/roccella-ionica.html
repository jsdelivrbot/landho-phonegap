<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>It is important to contact the marina before entering</strong> as the entrance often silts up and is constantly needing to be dredged. In spite of this, the channel moves constantly and entry in winds of above force 6/7 or swell of more than 1.0 metre is not recommended.</p>
<p>Depth at the entrance is maintained at <span>3.5m - keeping close to the port side of the entrance.</span></p>
<p>See comments below for latest charges.</p>
<p><span> It is still possible to moor on the quay which is controlled by the Coastia Guardia.</span></p>
