<div class="hello"><div><p>Vieste is an attractive holiday town sitting on the eastern tip of the promentry of El Gargano (<span> the ‘spur’ projecting from the ‘boot’ of the peninsula)</span>.</p>
<p><span>In Medieval times, the port was frequently attacked by pirates and Saracens, and by enemies of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1554 around 5,000 inhabitants were executed by the Turks, on the grounds that they were too elderly or infirm to merit transportation into slavery. This event is commemorated annually in a ceremony which has now become a kind of "Summer Halloween".</span></p>
<p><span>Position 41°13.5'N,15°45'E.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is<strong> not</strong> a Port of Entry. The nearest such port is <span>Manfredonia, about 30nm south west of Vieste.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Shelter in the harbour is good, although strong winds from N and NE may cause a surge.</p>
<p>There are marina pontoons here on the north side of the harbour as well as some on the south. There are 7 pontoons, all run as separate private businesses. Recommendation is to take the first pontoon to port on entering. Laid lines, all services available and berthing rates very negotiable if staying longer than one or two nights. A yacht can be left here with good security.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> Yachts can anchor in the outer harbour in 5 to 10m over sand.</p>
<p>The bay to the south of the old city is another good anchorage in 7m, also over sand with good holding. Exposed only from SE to NE but can be affected by swell.</p>
