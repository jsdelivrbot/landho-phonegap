<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Ustica is small island lying between Sicily and Sardinia, approximately 35NM north </span><span>of Palermo (between which a regular ferry service runs).</span></p>
<p><span>The island is a marine park and a popular diving destination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The harbour on the north east side of the island gives good shelter from the prevailing westerly winds.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There is room for between 5-7 yachts on the concrete wall with laid moorings, however the berthing </span><span>administrator will most likely shout at you to "use your anchor". The </span><span>bottom is good holding in sand.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The berthing administrator also runs the closest shop. He is reported to be very friendly (limited English) and will help you </span><span>with your lines, rents out scooters, has a dive shop etc.</span></p>
<p><span>A small square is walking distance from the harbour with restaurants </span><span>and bars. There are a few local shops but better provisioning a taxi/car ride away.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a fuel dock opposite the berths although check depths as it is reported to be shallow here. </span></p>
