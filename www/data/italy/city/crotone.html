<div class="hello"><div><p>Crotone is easily identified by four gas platforms on the approach.  The commercial harbour is completely separate and off to the NW.  Beware of the usual amount of commercial traffic and cruise ships in the area.  Once within the small boat harbour there are several competing marina concerns.</p>
<p>In general quite a fun place to be if you do not have too high an expectation.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Upon entering the harbour you will be able to identify several signs saying “Transit” yachts.  Ormeggiatioren will aggressively compete with each other to attract you to “their” marina.  Do not be overly influenced and choose what is best for your boat and the prevailing conditions (and to avoid damage to your boat).</p>
<p><span>As usual with Ormeggiatiore, someone will meet you on the quay and decide upon a charge (negotiation may be possible depending on your bargaining skills). </span><span>Lazy lines are tailed to the quay but may be a bit jumbled up and crossed.</span></p>
<p>There is a small shower and toilet block, but check you are entitled to use it when negotiating the mooring fee. Water and electricity are available but be ready with adaptors and socket doublers in case you have to share with a neighbouring yacht.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Crotone_docking_PPelo.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Two new "L" shaped floating jetties have been installed on the inside of the main breakwater, to starboard as you enter the port, so there is now much more space available for visiting yachts <i>(photo courtesy of Peter Ter Haar)</i>. The floating pontoon is alongside a low concrete dock making getting aboard easy. Mooring lines here are new, and each berth has electricity (16 amp) and water (potable). Price for a 12m yacht per night in September 2013 was 30 Euros. Marineros said to be helpful and friendly.</p>
<p>It's a pleasent walk into town from here around the harbour (1.5km) and the beach road<i> (to the south of the photo)</i> is lined with restaurants, cafes and bars.</p>
<p>Fuel is available from a small operation on the end of the E mole.  If unattended the owner can be telephoned with the help of the marina staff.</p>
<p><span>Boats do anchor in the New Port (Porto Novo) at the west side of the pier where the police boats are.</span></p>
<p>A good selection of supermarkets a short walk away, with street sellers for fresh fruit and veg.  A couple of decent chandlers and general boat shops.</p>
<p>A useful anchoring map for the Le Castella marine park, stretching around the coast to Crotone, can be found <b><a class="external-link" href="images/pdfs/italy_le-castella-marine-park_anchoring/">here. </a></b></p>
