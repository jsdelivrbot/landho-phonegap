      This port is about 10 miles east of San Remo. It has all the usual facilities, including laundry, fuel, chandlery and a crane, as well as 40 ton  and 100 ton travel lifts. The previous problem of swell has now been solved by the new breakwater. Due to the high ground, both radio and mobile phone reception is poor.
