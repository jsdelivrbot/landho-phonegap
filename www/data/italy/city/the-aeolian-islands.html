<div class="hello"><div><p>The Aeolian Islands are a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily and are a very popular tourist destination.</p>
<p>Because the largest island is called Lipari, the islands are sometimes referred to as the Lipari Islands or Lipari group. The other islands include Vulcano, Salina, Stromboli, Filicudi, Alicudi,and Panarea.</p>
<p>Each island has its own unique characteristics and with the on-going volcanic activity here, these islands should not be missed.</p>
<p><span>These islands get very busy between 15 July and 20 August.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>As these islands are volcanic in origin, the sea bed slopes off very rapidly from the shore. Most of the convenient anchorages in normal depths </span><span>are already full by 1500-1600 hrs, so if arriving later you may well have to anchor a little further off in 15-18m. Go</span><span> prepared with plenty of chain (60-80m).</span></p>
<p>The weather can be very changeable, so be prepared to up-anchor and move if necessary. Pontoons and docks here tend to be quite pricey.</p>
<p><strong>Vulcano</strong><br/><span>This island offers several anchorages, the one to the west is reported to be good. Take care as the bottom is rocky. A walk up the volcano in the early morning (before it gets too hot) is worthwhile, followed by a visit to the mud-baths. At the western anchorage there is a</span><span> Hotel that offers a classic set menu for a reasonable price. </span><br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lipari</strong><br/><span>The largest island in the group. A good place to shop for A</span><span class="highlightedSearchTerm">eolian</span><span> specialties, especially their huge capers. T<span>here are 2 or 3 (over-priced) pontoons here with good shelter, except from Easterly winds.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Salina</strong><span> <br/>Approximately 40NM from Messina. Reported to have a friendly <span>marina located on the south east side </span><span>with plenty of space (in May). Likely to be crowded in the summer months, although staff will always try to squeeze another yacht in. </span><span>Good facilities on shore with </span><span>showers and toilets. Water and electricity included in the berthing price</span><span>. Next to the marina is the ferry port where there is a fuel dock. </span><span>Provisioning within reasonable walking distance, also restaurants and bars.<br/></span>Good anchorage on the north east. The small village of Lingua is reported to have the best granita (pistacchio and gelsi flavour) of all the archipelago.</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Filicudi<br/></strong><span>This is a nice little quiet town with<span> a concrete ferry </span><span>pier, but very unprotected from the wind and the swell. There are mooring buoys available here.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Alicudi</strong><span> <br/>Reported to have a fairly good anchorage on the north side.</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Panarea</strong><br/><span>In the summer this island is where those that want to be seen flock to. Alot of boats and the night life lasts until the early hours of the morning! Lisca Bianca offers a good anchorage and swimming spot with underwater sulphur bubbles.</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Stromboli</strong><br/><span>Watching Stromboli (an active volcano) erupt in the dark is a sight not to be missed. </span></p>
<p><span><span> Anchor on the black volcanic sand bottom in front of the main town on the NE of the Island. </span></span><span>Yachts must anchor very</span><span> close to shore because of the great depth of the water. There are also mooring buoys here for a fee.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Visit the crater at night. A good 3/4 hour walk with </span><span>head</span><span> lamps. All gear can be rented and guides are mandatory. Alternatively you can raise your anchor and sail in front of the lava path on the north western side maintaining a safe distance. Eruptions every +/-10minutes - a spectacle you will never forget.</span></p>
