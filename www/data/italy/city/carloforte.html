<div class="hello"><div><p>An interesting port on the island of San Piedro, off the SW corner of Sardinia. It is a useful stopping-off point for boats making the passage from the Balearics.</p>
<p>There is a pretty promenade with many cafes and restaurants along the front, it seems popular with Italian tourists from the mainland.  Several small, good value supermarkets a short walk into town.  A couple of small chandlers selling general boat items.</p>
<p>In the San Pietro channel, some of the buoyage marked on the chart is missing.  The frequent passenger ferries running from the mainland into the harbour can be useful indicators of the route in. It is fairly straightforward but the general shallowness of the channel can be somewhat of a shock after a long passage at sea.  Take care when approaching the harbour as depths are shallower than marked.</p>
<p>Position 39° 08'43"N, 08° 19'05"E (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>No anchoring is allowed in the harbour and be careful if anchoring outside, as the ferries approach the entrance from several different directions.</p>
<p>There are two marina here, both managed by the same company. The facility in the NW part of the harbour, <span>Marina Mamma Mahon,</span> is where s<span>hort-stay visitors normally berth as it is closer to the town and facilities. The other marina, Marina Flamingos, is in the southern part of the harbour by the salt pans. It is more remote from the town, but quieter and used mainly by long stay boats.</span></p>
<p>The "ormeggiatori" are very helpful in meeting boats and helping them to a berth.</p>

      Located to sta'bd on entering the harbour and close to the town centre. The visitors' pontoon is at right angles to the N mole. It is subject to some wash. Beware that some of the pontoons securing chains run close to the surface.<br>
Water and electricity on the pontoons, WiFi, laundry, limited security.<br>
Very friendly, some English spoken.
