<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/italy-pics/italy_salerno_marina-d-arechi/@@images/image/mini"/>An extension of the </span><span>Molo Di Levante</span><span> breakwater is now complete making Marina d’Arechi a very well protected marina with good facilities and very helpful staff. About half the pontoons are completed with very good water pressure and power on each. There is also a good restaurant in the marina and cocktail bar. Security is reported to be excellent with gate codes on each pontoon and on the main gate. There are plans to add a lot more to the marina, but no fixed timescale, and latest reports are that construction is still on-going.</span></p>
<p><span>The disadvantage is that it is a drive to Salerno and to the nearest supermarkets. The marina organises car hire (which delivers to the marina) and taxis and there are bicycles which can be used free of charge. </span></p>

Good security, restaurant, fuel berth. Marina can organise car hire and bicycles are free to hire. Boatyard with hard standing and 220 ton travelift.
