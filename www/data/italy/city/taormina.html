<div class="hello"><div><p>Taormina Roads is open to the south east.</p>
<p>There are 20 orange mooring buoys here, available for hire from  the operator, George Rizzo who lives on  site on his yacht Grande Siècle from June through to September. He charges 40 Euros a night.</p>
<p>George offers a very flexible service to his customers.  He will ferry clients to and from the shore, (the nearest secure dinghy landing is a half a mile away), arrange tours of Mt Etna and other attractions, bring  water to the yacht and generally do his best to be helpful.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor here rather than take a mooring buoy. George is also very helpful to yachts at anchor. Cruisers have reported it can be very rolly here with wind against tide.</p>
<p>There is a larger bay to the south in which is is possible to find an anchorage. Even better, is the anchorage off Naxos in 3m and good sand. Landing by dinghy is easy and ashore there is a supermarket and the bus stop for transport to Taormina.</p>
