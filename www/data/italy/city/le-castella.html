<div class="hello"><div><p>Located in the province of Crotone on the Ionian coast of Calabria, this is a useful haven in bad weather. It lies approx. <span>55 miles NE of </span>Rocella Ionica<span> and 15 miles SW of </span>Crotone<span>.</span></p>

<p><span></span>The fortress here dating back five centuries was fully restored in 2001 and is well worth a visit<i> (picture taken by Peter Ter Haar)</i>.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../LeCastella_yachtharbour_Ppelo.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The harbour has a southern basin reserved for fishing boats and a northern basin for leisure craft<i> (see photo left taken </i><i>by Peter Ter Haar, entrance to the right of picture)</i>. It is well maintained and run by local government.</p>
<p><span></span><span>There is no longer a sluice gate in the eastern part of the yacht basin. This closed 8 years ago. Cruisers visiting in 2013 report that depth is a minimum of 3 metres. </span><span>Shelter is good.</span></p>
<p>Fees are based on the width of your boat (e.g. 50€/night for a 3.95 metre wide boat). <span>This scale runs from 3.61 up to 4.5 metres regardless of boat length. </span><span>There is one place for a 17 meter boat, alongside the former day trip boat berth.</span></p>
<p><span>The northern basin has w</span><span>ater and electricity. There is a guard / marinero and security cameras. This basin is very well lit both night and day.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Yachts are permitted in the southern basin, but only when the fishing boats are out and the pier is fully occupied in the evening with fishing boats.</span></span></p>
<p>There is a good supermarket 200 metres from the harbour and a small chandlery close by.</p>
