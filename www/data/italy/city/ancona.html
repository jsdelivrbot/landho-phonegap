<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is on the Adriatic coast of Italy, almost directly opposite Split. It is a busy ferry terminal. It is an attractive and colourful town which draws a large number of Italian tourists. There are hidden corners of the port which are largely medieval and it is well worth exploring the side streets.</p>
<p><span>Being centrally located, it is a good point from which to explore Italy by land (Florence, Pisa, and Rome).</span></p>
<p>Position 43°36' 37"N, 13°28'42"E (marina)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The yacht harbour is SW of the entrance to the commercial harbour and is the only real option for secure berthing in Ancona, although it is a fair distance from the city. Access to the marina is only permitted between 07:00 and 21:00. Beware of the cross currents at the entrance to the marina. Cruisers report this marina is sheltered and pleasant. The train station is less than a mile from the marina and there is a bus that picks up at the marina and takes you directly to the train station.</p>
<p>Free berths at the yacht club in the inner basin of the commercial port are unlikely and although it is possible the berth in the commercial harbour (keeping clear of any commercial vessels), a yacht cannot be left unattended there.</p>
<p>Strong winds from almost any direction can cause discomfort here, apart from in the inner basin.</p>
