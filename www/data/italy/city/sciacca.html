<div class="hello"><div><p>Sciacca lies on the south west coast of Sicily. It <span>is an ancient town, founded by the Greeks as a place for the residents of Selinunte to “take the waters” from the volcanic thermal springs that lie under the town. Now days it is a busy working fishing port.</span></p>
<p><span>The city centre (reached up tiled steps from the marina) has preserved much of its medieval layout. Excellent restaurants in the narrow lanes offer local seafood dishes in the Sicilian tradition.</span></p>

<p>There are two marinas, adjacent to each other, both on the west side of the harbor. The first dock on the left as you enter the harbor is the Circulo Nautico “Il Corallo,” and the second and third docks are the “Lega Navale.”</p>
<p>The Lega Navale seems to offer more services (showers and laundry) and monitors VHF channel 12. It is also slightly more protected from whatever surge enters the harbor. Prices are quite reasonable, and their staff is friendly and helpful. Little English is spoken here.</p>
