<div class="hello"><div><p>The old part of this town is a very attractive medieval fishing port. It has now expanded into a large modern city on the landward side and is Iocated just south of the promontory of Gargano.</p>
<p>Unfortunately however, it now appears this port is closed to leisure boats (see comment at bottom of page - September 2015).</p>
