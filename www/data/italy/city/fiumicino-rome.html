<div class="hello"><div><p>There are many small marinas in the Fiumicino River as well as the very large, Porto di Roma, just south of the river entrance.</p>
<p><span>In strong onshore winds and with the ebb running in the river, steep breaking seas can exist from the 10m contour until well into the river. There are many moorings here, in the river and in the yards along each side. There are regular buses to Ostia Antica and Fiumicino.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/Rome_FumincinoCanal_bridgeopening_TWalton.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/> <img class="image-inline" src="Countries/Rome_FumincinoCanalOutbound_TWalton.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/></p>
<p>Just 2 miles north of the river is the <span>Fiumicino </span>canal, which offers lower priced berthing (with buses to Rome). It is very close to Rome's very busy airport. There are two bridges - a lift (bascule) footbridge and a vertical-lift road bridge (<i>thanks to Tom Walton for the photos</i>).</p>
<p>The bridge opening times change annually. For 2013 they are:<br/><span>Monday, Thursday &amp; Friday: 0630 &amp; 2000</span><br/><span>Saturday: <span>0800 &amp; 2000</span></span><br/><span>Sunday:<span>0900, 1400 &amp; 2000</span></span><br/><span>NO bridge opening Tuesday or Wednesday!</span><br/><span>Bridge height is 21m maximum. </span></p>
<p>There is a small marina on the South side of the Canal (Darsena Traiano), just before the bridges. As it appears very full, a prior reservation would be advisable.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Rome_CantiereNauticoAlbula_TWalton.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The Cantiere Nautico Albula is on the north side of the canal beyond both bridges and has been recommended by a number of Noonsite readers. Whilst facilities are basic with no frills, Max the manager speaks excellent English and is very helpful and friendly. Another recommendation by cruisers is Constellation Nautica nearby.</p>
<p>The areas for docking on the canal are not as picturesque as those in the river, and walking around at night alone would definitely feel uncomfortable. It is however very convenient for visiting the centre of Rome city. T<span>he local Fumincino Bus (orange) costs 1€ to the Parco Leonardo train station. From here you can travel to the central city station of choice for 1.50 to 2.60 €.  The Cotral Bus (blue) runs to the Fumincino/Roma Airport regularly.</span></p>
<p><span>Fumincino has a number of chandleries, sail makers and trades people available for boat work. Local provisioning was excellent with multiple supermarkets and local produce markets. Nice bulk wine shop in town.</span></p>
