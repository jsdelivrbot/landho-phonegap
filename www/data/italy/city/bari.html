<div class="hello"><div><p>Bari is a large modern city and is the regional centre for this part of Italy. It has a commercial port as well as an Old Harbour (Porto Vecchio) where there are yacht berths. This old port is close to the centre of the ancient part of the city with its confusing maze of narrow streets.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can berth alongside the Molo San Antonia in Porto Vecchio (old port) on the south side of the peninsula. There is usually plenty of room here. Care is needed to tie only to the part of the Molo that has the lower section of wharf. It runs from about half way along the Mole towards the light at the end.</p>
<p>Shelter is good.</p>
<p>There is also a sailing club in Porto Vecchio that will take boats bow or stern to if there is room available.</p>
<p><span>Cantieri Nautica Ranieri now has pontoons installed and can offer marina berthing, albeit in a rather "workshop" setting. A possible option if you are planning on leaving your boat for some time as security here is reported to be very good.</span></p>
<p>An alternative berth can be found at the modern marina at Polignano a Mare, 20nm south of Bari.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor inside the harbour at Mola di Bari, 10 nm from Bari.</p>
