<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a small, but very attractive harbour located at the extreme southern tip of Italy's "heel", at the entrance to the Adriatic. It is an ideal stopover before the "jump" to Corfu. Be aware of considerable commercial traffic rounding Pt. Risolta. Fuel and some repair facilities are available here.    </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>With a marina now installed in this harbour, it makes a very useful port of call, although shelter is rather limited if there is any south in the wind. A swell tends to enter the harbour whatever the direction of the the wind.</p>
<p>In settled weather, it is possible to anchor in the bay south of the main breakwater. The holding is good in sand.</p>
<p>It is now forbidden to tie up alongside the outside mole.</p>
<p>There are a couple of supermarkets within easy walking distance. Most other businesses and properties seem to be seasonal.</p>
<p>Last updated April 2012.</p>
