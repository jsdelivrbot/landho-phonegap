<div class="hello"><div><p>Usefully situated about halfway along the Northern coast of Sicily, Cefalu's old harbour has a pretty aspect and the town’s pale cream/white church is easily identifiable from the sea. </p>
<p>The harbour itself is several hundred metres to the Eastern side of the town/church promontory. The green light on the end of the mole has fallen into disrepair and does not operate. The mole end is quite broken and should be given a decent offing. The whole harbour has suffered significant silting and is wide open to the East.</p>
<p>There are no facilities here, however fuel is available.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Upon entry do not venture in too far, since depths gradually shoal.  </p>
<p>The pontoons are generally a muddle of local lines and floats, make way with care. Do not be tempted to go alongside the hammerhead upon entry.  There are many rusty and broken constructions here and any swell here can easily damage a yacht.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in the area around the two large rocks or “Scoglio”.  Holding is good in thick muddy sand and this is probably a safer bet if arriving in the dark.  Be sure to show a good anchor light since this area puts you somewhat in the middle of the main passage into the harbour.  In any case traffic is mainly small local boats.</p>
<p>Whilst the above docking info. may put many off this port, with the right wind direction and some care this is a very pretty and “rustic” one night stopover to break up a long passage.</p>
<p>The local "Ormeggiatori" may or may not be bothered to come and see you.</p>
<p>There is a fuel pontoon here, however it is not accessible by boat, and a small sand bank can be seen directly in front of the fuel pump. The fuel station opening time is in the afternoon, but tends to be unreliable.</p>
