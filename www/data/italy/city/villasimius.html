<div class="hello"><div><p>A very useful marina on Sardinia for a passage to or from Sicily.   </p>
<p>Located on the Eastern side of the bay of Cagliari. Slightly open to the north, a relatively small fetch but some swell can make its way in.</p>
<p>Pretty, but reported to be quite unfriendly. The high cost for overnight berthing coupled with the poor facilities make this a useful place a quick rest, stopover or shelter only. The marina is a long walk from anything.</p>

<p>If anchoring, be aware that the holding near the marina is not good.</p>
