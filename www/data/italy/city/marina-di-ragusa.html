<div class="hello"><div><p>Marina di Ragusa is situated 20 miles west of Pozzallo and 29 miles SE of Gela. (Red and Green, 3 second flashing towers on entrance breakwaters).</p>
<p>Once a small fishing village, the development of the port area and opening of the  marina in 2010 has seen this once sleepy place turned into a popular beach resort. <span>The renovated town centre is adjacent to the marina and is fronted by beautiful beaches, crowded in summer, quiet in the off season. The surrounding area features beautiful historic baroque towns, a "must" visit.</span></p>
<p><span>The marina has space for over 700 yachts and according to feedback from cruisers who have made comparisons, this is possibly the most affordable marina in Italy for wintering.</span></p>
<p><span>Position <span>36° 46’78 N, 14°32’89 E.</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Currently this is not a Port of Entry.</strong></p>
<p><span>When arriving from outside the Schengen area, call in at Pozzallo, approx. 18 miles east of Marina di Ragusa, to clear in. </span></p>
<p><span>The marina has plans for offices for all clearance authorities, but they are not currently staffed. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina has long, overlapping breakwaters, giving protection from winds from all directions and of all strengths, even in the strongest winds there is no chop or any surges in the marina.</p>
<p>Entry is safe, except in very strong southerlies, minimum depth between the breakwaters is 3.6 meters. In the trough of large waves this could be much less, caution should be applied in severe conditions.</p>
<p>Once inside the breakwater marina personnel will guide you to a berth and assist with docking between the hours of 0600 and 2300. Call the marina on VHF channel 74. The sturdy pontoons are equipped with lazy lines and have 32-amp power connections and water outlets for every berth.</p>
<p><span>As well as berthing in the marina, it is also possible to anchor off in the lee of the breakwater giving shelter from the prevailing winds.</span></p>
<p>A boatyard is situated in the South West corner, equipped with a 160-ton travel lift and a 30-ton crane. The yard is capable of most repairs; working on your own boat is not permitted.</p>
<p><span>The town centre of Marina di Ragusa is adjacent to the marina, and in easy walking distance. <span>The town of Ragusa is a ½ an hour bus ride away and has a number of major shopping centres.</span></span></p>
