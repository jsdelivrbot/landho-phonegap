<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour may be subject to silting, so take care at the entrance if there is any swell.</p>
<p>Currently, a better option is the marina at <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Italy/Nettuno"><b>Nettuno</b></a> about a mile to the east. However, there are plans to install marina pontoons in the harbour.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage <span>just outside the harbour in 8 ft over sand. The <span>yacht club, located at the north corner of the harbour past the inner break wall, is happy to allow you to tie the dinghy up there. Do not anchor in the channel.</span></span></p>
<p>A fish farm off Capo D'Anzio has been established. It is marked by four yellow buoys and forms a serious hazard to yachts visiting this coast.</p>
