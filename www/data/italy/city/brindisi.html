<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a modern port at the southern end of the Adriatic Sea, and the main ferry port for Greece. In ancient times it was a Roman naval station and now it is also a modern one. Brindisi also has Romanesque churches, and a 13th century castle.</p>
<p>There is a good boatyard here for wintering your boat.</p>
<p>Position 40°39.6'N,17°59.8'E (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As this is a naval port, ensure your paperwork is in order and be sure to check in correctly.</p>
<p>The Harbourmaster's office overlooks the main quay in the inner harbour, directly opposite as you as you pass through the entrance. Customs are also based here.</p>
<p>Police are based in the town.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can berth on the NE-facing quay immediately in front of the harbour office in the old city. The area of this quay, opposite the entrance, is now used by the large fishing fleet when it returns each evening.</p>
<p>There are several marinas: Lega Navale, where there are also naval boats. A new marina just outside the city, Marina di Brindisi, also known as Porto Touristico, which is reported to be very good value for money if not a little isolated. There is also <span>a mooring station named “Approdo delle Indie” located inside the port <span>on the town quay providing shore power, water and internet.</span></span></p>
<p>Stopping in the new marina is the simplest option if on passage and only pausing for a night, or if planning on leaving your boat for an extended period.</p>
<p>The most comfortable berth is on the yacht club (Lega Navale) pontoons, which are close to town and amenities.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong><br/> A good place to anchor in bad weather, is on the northern side of the north arm of the inner harbour. The holding is good in about 7m.</p>

      600 pontoon berths.  All facilities. Crane and travel hoist. All repairs,  sailmaker and chandlery close by. Fuel dock just outside marina. Good shelter. Helpful staff. Economical winter berthing. Rentable storage space. One word of warning about the Marina di Brindisi: While it IS a very safe place in any conditions and has a very helpful staff, it is build upon the area of an old mussels farm. And the little beasts still like the area. Rather isolated, transport required. See comment below about hull growth here.
