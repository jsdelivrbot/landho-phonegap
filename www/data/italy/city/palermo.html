<div class="hello"><div><p>Acquasanta is a modern yacht harbour for visitors, just north of the two commercial harbour entrances.</p>
<p>There is a yacht harbour (Cala) in the southern corner of the commercial harbour. There are six different organisations providing moorings here on floating pontoons.<br/> It is reported that security of both people and boats here can also be rather doubtful and extra care is advised. Also there may be a problem with rats coming onboard.</p>
<p>The fuel station also has a few mooring moorings (about 40 euro/night) with water and electricity.</p>
<p>On the northern edge of the city is the small port of Arenella, the old part of which is used by fishing boats.</p>
