<div class="hello"><div><p>Berthing is in the port. Check which quay to use as one is cheaper than the other. The harbour can smell of sewage.</p>
<p>Anchoring outside the harbour in the bay is possible and free. There is a good anchorage <span>just outside the main harbour, to the SE of the Western point. It has good holding and is an easy ride into the port.</span></p>
<p>There are also many sheltered bays on both the north and south coasts which are worth visiting.</p>

      No mooring to the outer breakwater.<br>
The harbour itself has two quays, one is operated by the village adminstration and is cheaper, the other one  adjacent is private and is very expensive (100 euros/night for 12m). There does not appear to be any difference in the service offered by each quay. Both have water and electricity. Showers are available for a charge. Laundry.
