<div><p><b>Update January 2016: </b>Due to the current situation with regard to the number of migrants and refugees attempting to enter Europe, a number of Schengen Area countries have re-introduced border controls. Therefore, it is advisable that cruisers now check with the official authorities when entering or leaving a country.<span> </span></p>
<p>While at sea it is also advisable that any sightings of refugee/migrant boats be immediately reported to the appropriate Coast Guard via VHF. This is especially important if it is necessary to rescue any whose life is in danger.</p>
<p>Italy is a member of the European Union and therefore vessels arriving from another EU country, with only EU nationals on board, are not required to complete any formalities. Occasionally boats may be subjected to spot checks by customs (Guardia di Finanza), especially in areas known for smuggling. The formalities described below apply primarily to non-EU boats, although EU boats will have to conform to some of them, such as the requirement to have a valid third party insurance certificate on board. It is therefore recommended that any yacht arriving in Italy from abroad should attempt to do so at a port which has Customs and Immigration offices to which the captain should report on arrival.</p>
<p>Both EU and non-EU boats arriving from a country outside the EU (Tunisia, Albania, Turkey etc) must contact Customs at the first Italian port. On arrival in a port of entry, boats from non-EU countries must clear with the Port Captain as well as with Customs and Immigration.</p>
<p>Officials are very unlikely to come to a yacht, so the captain must report to their offices. Yachts have got into trouble for failing to report to the authorities.</p>
<p>The captain may be asked to show a certificate of competence; other documents needed are the registration certificate and third-party liability insurance.</p>
<p>It is advisable to monitor VHF channel 16 when in Italian waters, as failure to respond to a call from a Customs patrol can result in a stop and search operation.</p>
<p><strong><i>New Sept 2015:</i></strong> The insurance document must be in Italian and also must show the serial number of the outboard motor as well as the details of the tender.</p>

<p>Stop and search operations by Italian Police/Customs are not uncommon, and are more likely if a boat does not respond to an initial call on VHF channel 16.</p>
<p>A crackdown on the sellers and buyers of counterfeit items, i.e. purses, sunglasses, watches and belts, bearing luxury labels such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi and many others now means that criminal charges may be brought against people caught purchasing counterfeit products with fines up to 10,000 Euros.</p>
