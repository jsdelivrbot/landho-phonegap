<div><p>Any yacht wanting to visit Lebanon on their own should contact Jounieh Marina (Beirut) in advance for the latest procedures. Jounieh Marina (L'Automobile et Touring Club du Liban)BP 115 Jounieh, Lebanon Tel:  Country Code +961 993 2020; Mobile: +961 345 4403. Email <a href="mailto:atclmarina@terra.net.lb">atclmarina@terra.net.lb</a></p>
<p>The Lebanese Navy (call sign Oscar Charlie) should be contacted on VHF Channel 11 or 16 when 12 miles offshore and about to enter Lebanese territorial waters. Instructions will be given to proceed to Jounieh, which is the best place to clear into the Lebanon.</p>
<p>Be sure to make it clear whether you are a motor boat or a sailing yacht, as sailing boats are normally allowed to take a more direct route, whereas motor boats must follow the prescribed channel access.</p>
<p>The authorities should be contacted again when 6 miles from the marina entrance. The arrival should be timed to be during daylight hours. The port captain should be contacted on Channel 16 when about to enter the marina to be given directions to a free berth.</p>
<p>All formalities are completed in the marina and there are various clearance fees, which can be paid in US dollars. You will be asked for a port clearance form from your last port (zarpe) and they estimate the time you have been at sea from leaving there and arriving in Lebanon. It is no use handing in a two week old Port Said form as you will be asked to leave. This also applies to Syria.</p>

<div><p>All nationalities require a valid passport (valid for at least 3 months) and a visa. Visitors from the US and many Arab and European countries can obtain visas on arrival. They are normally issued for periods of up to 3 months.</p>
<p>Entry will be refused if you are holding a used or unused, expired or valid visa for Israel, or have any Israeli stamp endorsed on your passport. This includes evidence if you have crossed the border with either Egyptian or Jordanian border crossing stamps. Your next port of call from Lebanon can not be Israel, neither can your last port be so.</p>
<p>If you are planning to visit Syria (<b>not currently advisable</b>), make sure you have a visa before arriving in Lebanon, as there is no Syrian Embassy in Beirut and Syrian visas cannot be obtained on the border.</p>

<div><p>Lebanon has relatively good health facilities. </p>
<p>Similar to other countries, hepatitis A and B vaccines are recommended; also make sure tetanus-diphtheria and measles vaccinations are up-to-date. </p>
<p>A typhoid vaccine is also recommended for travel to Lebanon. </p>
<p>Although Beirut's tap water is considered safe to drink, it's probably best to drink bottled water as the Lebanese do. </p>
<p>As is the general rule, to be absolutely safe, drink water only from bottles with intact caps, do not take ice in your drinks, and eat only cooked food and fruits that you can peel.</p>
