<div class="hello"><div><p>Beirut has long been considered, by virtue of its strategic location, the crossroads between the three continents of Asia, Africa and Europe and its inhabitants are a unique blend of the Eastern and Western cultures. Much of the city's infrastructure, destroyed during hostilities in 2006, has now been rebuilt.</p>
<p>Beirut is one of the largest commercial ports in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The latest travel advice should be consulted before travel to Lebanon.</p>
<p>Position 33° 54.2'N, 35° 31.1'E.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>At 12nm from the coast, yachts should call Oscar Charley on VHF channel 11 and ask them to contact the planned marina asking for a clearance number. Then request permission to enter Lebanese waters.</p>
<p>Only after receiving permission, should the yacht proceed.</p>
<p>As with all yacht movements in Lebanon, Military Operation Control (Oscar Charlie) must be contacted prior to departure or arrival at any port in Lebanon even when already cleared into the country.</p>
<p>An unreported movement will soon be followed by a visit from a Lebanese Navy patrol boat and endless questions.</p>
<p>The ATCL Jounieh marina will very efficently deal with all the necessary paperwork.</p>
<p>LaMarina JK and the Beirut Marina will arrange for an agent (at a cost) to do the same.</p>
<p>Anchoring anywhere is forbidden.</p>
