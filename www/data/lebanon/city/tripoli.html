<div class="hello"><div><p>Tripoli, in North Lebanon, is built on a rocky promontory. Its position enhanced by the presence of offshore islands and natural ports. This is a city where the modern and medieval blend easily into a lively and hospitable metropolis. Modern Tripoli is divided into two parts: El - Mina ( the port area and site of the ancient city ) and the town of Tripoli proper. The medieval city, at the foot of the Crusader castle, is where most of the historical sites are located. </p>
<p>Tripoli is predominately made up of Muslims, so women should cover their legs with long trousers/skirt and not bear their shoulders. Men shouldn not wear shorts which are too short.</p>
