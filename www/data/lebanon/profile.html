<li>The latest travel advice should be consulted before travel to Lebanon as the situation there can change rapidly. The risk of unrest remains and civilians are at risk from terrorist incidents. See

<li>Since the 2006 conflict between Israel and the Hizbollah forces, much of the destruction caused in Beirut at that time has been repaired. Although the political situation can be volatile, more cruising boats are visiting Lebanon. The construction of two new marinas in Beirut and being able to use the ATCL marina in Jounieh as a convenient base from which to explore the interior, has helped.</li>
<li>The Lebanese are a multi-faith, multi-ethnic people. Arabic is the official language, but English and French are also widely spoken. The two main religions are Islam and Christianity.</li>
