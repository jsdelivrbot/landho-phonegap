<div class="hello"><div><p>Rarotonga is the vibrant centre of the Cook Islands and is where government resides.  Circular and only 32 km in circumference, it is dominated by high mountain peaks from which lush rain forests provide a dramatic backdrop to a palm-fringed shore.</p>
<p>The island is almost completely encircled by a reef, however there is no navigable lagoon, or free anchoring here.</p>
<p><span>Avatiu Harbour underwent a</span> huge harbour realignment and dredging project to straighten the east quay and dredge the basin to 10m. This project was completed at the end of 2012 and the harbour has now re-opened to visting yachts.</p>
<p>The end result is a better arrangement for yachts, however locals warn that the harbour is now even more exposed and open to the north winds and seas brought on by frontal passages, due to the additional dredging (luckily most of the weather comes from the ESE).</p>
<p>Position 21° 12.06' S, 159° 47.02' W (Avarua harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<p>With the following information:-<br/> - Estimated date of arrival and departure.<br/> - Sailing vessel description: length, beam, draft and gross tonnage.<br/> - Sailing vessel mast height (there is a maximum of 28 meters, but if over other solutions are possible).</p>

<p><strong>Clearing Out</strong></p>
<p>The departure fees are also paid to the Harbour Master's Office. These fees must be paid by 2:00 pm on a Friday if you plan to leave on the weekend. Then you must walk into town to the Immigration Office (by the Post Office). Each person on board must fill out their own departure card. These cards, along with a crew list form, are submitted to Immigration and they will then stamp your passports.  The Customs office is in the same building and is the final stop. A flat fee for officers' time is paid to Customs</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As an alternative to mooring in Avatiu Harbour, yachts can anchor in the open ocean roadstead off town.  However, with the Trade Winds blowing it can be rougher at anchor here than at sea. The holding is terrible; flat hard coral with a couple of inches of sand over it.</p>

<p><strong>Mooring in Avatiu Harbour</strong></p>
<p>The harbour redesign has meant that there is more draft (10m) and the harbour now even has port and starboard entry buoys. Mooring is still at the Southern end of the main harbour with stern to anchoring (Med style using own anchors). There is now straight access to sea when moored, so less shelter than there was previously, particularly with a northerly swell. Surge can be a problem here.<span> </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>Be prepared to use the dinghy to take lines ashore when mooring up.</p>
<p>A height restriction of 27m is in place at the north end of the wharf as yacht masts obstruct aircraft taking off from the nearby airport.</p>
<p><span>Harbour dues are charged on a daily rate. Harbour facilities include a very basic washroom and shower.  A key deposit of NZ $30 must be paid.  You get $10 back upon return of the key.</span></p>
<p><span> There are garbage and recycling bins near the Harbour Master's office.</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst this report </span><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Members/sue/R2010-09-17-2"><strong>Tips for Mooring in Avatiu Harbour</strong> </a>was written in 2010, much of the advice is still current.</p>
