<div class="hello"><div><p>Aitutaki lies 220 km north of Rarotonga. It measures just 20 square km.</p>
<p>The entrance to the pass is narrow (less than 100 ft across) and unmarked, caution is urged before heading in. Cruisers report that both Navionics and C-Map are 300 meters off on placement of the pass. See these <a href="Countries/CookIslands/cook-islands-aitutaki-useful-directions-for-the-pass"><strong>useful directions</strong></a> for entering the anchorage here.</p>
<p>The channel into the harbour area has a least depth of only 1.7m at high tide, therefore, careful timing is essential. Outflowing tidal currents can reach three to four knots, therefore the best time to enter is just before high tide (least current). Good sunlight is essential. If in any doubt, ask someone to guide you in.</p>
<p>Position 18° 51'08"S, 159° 48'32"W</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CookIslands/Suwarrow/Countries/CookIslands?rc=Formalities">Cook Islands Formalities</a></b><span> for complete clearance information.</span></p>
<p>Once anchored (see docking) the captain should come ashore to clear in.</p>
<p>The Customs &amp; Immigration officer may come out to the boat or you may check with him at his office, in the post office building. There is departure tax per person to pay and a daily anchoring fee. The health officer will contact you too for pratique (his office is on the other side of the island) for which there is a fee.</p>
<p>Clearance here is reported to be slow.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The end of the channel has 2 sides: left passage leading into the small harbour and the right passage leading to the small anchorage off Arutanga village.</p>
<p>Due to a strong tidal current different from the prevailing winds, it is recommended to anchor fore and aft in the anchorage, as the deep area is small (or tie the stern to a coconut tree). Boats too large or with deeper draft should anchor outside the reef to the south of the channel (there is a shallower area also on the North side but a real trap for anchors!), however poor holding and bommies have been reported here.</p>
<p>Docking stern-to with a bow anchor in the harbour may be done with permission of the port captain, on condition the yacht is moved if required. There are plans to deepen the channel leading to the harbour to carry 20 ft all the way, and the harbour to be enlarged.</p>
<p>Fees are now being charged to anchor here.</p>
