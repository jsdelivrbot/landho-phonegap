<div class="hello"><div><p>Currently there is just an anchorage (about 35-50ft) on the west side of the island, near the village.</p>
<p>The entrance into the lagoon is only passable by narrow vessels drawing less than 5ft.</p>
<p>There are plans to widen the entrance and extend the current dock to allow berthing for boats with up to 6ft draft, as well as installing 4 sturdy moorings.</p>
