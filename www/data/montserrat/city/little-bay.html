<div class="hello"><div><p>Little Bay, the only port on Montserrat, is on the northwest end of the island and is now the island's capital and main port of entry due to the destruction of Port Plymouth by volcanic activity.</p>
<p>It is an industrial port a long way from town, so you will need a taxi to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Don't miss the <span>tiny restaurant under the anchorage's cliff, and be sure to</span> a<span>rrange a driving tour to see the ruined town of Plymouth, and visit the volcano research center.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Basic docking facilities have now been built at Little Bay for ferry and cargo boats..</p>
<p>Montserrat is currently developing a new port and marina in the Little Bay area.  In coming years a protected breakwater, port, ferry terminal, small ship cruise terminal, and a 60- 80 berth marina with services will be available.  Follow this at <a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/MontserratYachtClub/?fref=ts" target="_blank"><strong>www.facebook.com/montserratyachtclub.com</strong></a></p>
<p>For further information or assistance to visiting yachts please contact Ralph Birkhoff, Commodore, Montserrat Yacht Club at <a href="mailto:ralph.birkhoff@gmail.com"><strong>ralph.birkhoff@gmail.com</strong></a> or 664.496.3888.</p>
<p>Currently there is just an anchorage for visiting yachts. Holding is good with a sandy bottom, however it is deep and can get very rolly so pick your weather conditions carefully. <span>The most protected spot for anchoring seems to be north of the dock in front of the small fishing fleet, were there is room for a couple of boats.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Rendez-vous bay, just to the north of Little Bay (5 minutes north by dinghy) is often less rolly. </span><br/></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Shamrock Moorings plan to lay some moorings in both Little Bay and Rendez-vous, however there are currently no moorings available for visiting yachts.</span></p>
<p>There are no boatyards.</p>
<p>There is a fuel station situated some 2 km inland from Little Bay.</p>
<p>The owner of <a href="Countries/Montserrat/LittleBay/?rc=ShoreServices#RestaurantsBars"><strong>bar/restaurant</strong></a> Soca Cabana in Little Bay can provide information on marine repairs.</p>
