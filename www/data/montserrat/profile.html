<div><ul>
<li>Montserrat is a small island in the Leewards chain and is a British Overseas Territory.  The residents are now full British citizens.</li>
<li>It is a useful navigation mark for yachts plying between Antigua and Guadeloupe. There is no natural harbour but there are a few sheltered bays on the north-west coast with Old Road Bay, Bunkum Bay, Little Bay and Rendezvous Bay being the major ones. However, winter swells can make anchorage untenable at certain times.</li>
<li>Following the dramatic eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 1995 the southern two-thirds of the island was devastated, including the capital, Plymouth. </li>
<li>There is an Exclusion Zone around the southern part of the island. This zone extends some way out to sea from Trants Bay in the east around the southern coast to Barton Bay in the west. There is considerable shoaling in the Old Road Bay and Plymouth areas, which will continue to extend for several years. </li>
<li>It is important to check the current volcanic situation on the Montserrat Volcano Observatory  (MVO) website at <a href="http://www.mvo.ms"><strong>www.mvo.ms</strong></a> and avoid entering the current exclusion zones without specific authority. There has been no significant volcanic activity since 2010..</li>
<li>The northern part of the island was untouched and is an attractive and verdant land. Peaceful, quiet and uncrowded.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>
