            </h2>
<div><p><strong>SailClear</strong></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/"><strong>SailClear</strong></a><span> advance web notification service for clearance is now operational in Montserrat. </span><span>All duly appointed officers stationed at Little Bay port have been fully trained on the SailClear system, and any new officers will be trained on the system.</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can complete all the SailClear online forms in advance, or there is a computer terminal at Customs in Little Bay.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In the near future visiting vessels will be able to connect to a WiFi system with reach of approximately ¼ mile offshore.  This will allow access to the </span><span></span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/"><strong>SailClear</strong></a><span> system before landing.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>On Arrival</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Montserrat/LittleBay">Little Bay</a></strong> is now the island's <strong>only </strong>port of entry.</p>
<p><span>Before arriving, it is recommended that you radio the Port Authority on VHF Ch.16 to check on conditions here. </span><span>VHF Ch:16 is monitored 24/7 by the Port Authority.</span></p>
<p>On arrival anchor in the southern part of the bay, keeping clear of the channel to the ferry/cargo wharf. In future this channel will be clearly marked.</p>
<p>No crew or passengers must land before clearance is granted.</p>
<p><strong>Inward Clearance</strong></p>
<p><span>Check in at the Customs and Immigration office which is in the Port office. As you come off the jetty you will see a sign over a door at the warehouse.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Immigration are open 08:00-16:00, but not at weekends or public holidays. </span><span>Any vessel arriving outside of these hours can either wait aboard at anchor until C&amp;I reopens, or request an ‘out of hours’ check in. <span>If you arrive outside of working hours there is an overtime charge. </span></span></p>
<p>Next check in with the Port Authority who are also in the warehouse. Clearance from the previous port must be submitted to the Port Authority.<span> </span></p>
<p>All fees are paid to the Port Authority (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Montserrat?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a> </strong>below).</p>
<p><span>To avoid being stopped at the port gates, check in with Port Security.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruising Montserrat</strong></p>
<p><span>If a visiting vessel intends to stay a few days in Montserrat, they can request and obtain a Coastal Cruising authorization from Customs and Immigration, which gives them permission to land at any authorized beach outside of the official Exclusion Zone for a period of up to 7 days.  There is no cost for this permit. </span></p>
<p>Even if you intend to dinghy ashore to the beach in Little Bay you will require this authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Outward Clearance</strong></p>
<p><span>Yachts can obtain clearance in and out at the same time if staying 72 hours or less. If staying longer, there is no additional charge, but you will have to return to Customs to do the paperwork again. Only Customs needs to be visited for departure.</span><span> There is no departure tax.</span></p>
