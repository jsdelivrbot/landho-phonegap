<div class="hello"><div><p>Freetown can be used as an emergency fuelling stop, however it is not recommended to stop here for any other reason. If just stopping for fuel there is no requirement to clear in or out. </p>
<p>The river at Freetown  is wide and does not provide good shelter. Local pilots warn not to anchor out during the night as there is a lot of crime.</p>
<p>The diesel is of dubious quality and should be filtered. It arrives by can from the local filling station. Water is also available. </p>
