<p>SIM cards can be purchased for use with your own mobile phone on arrival at the airport and it is advisable that you do this. Their services are mostly available on a prepaid basis but it is possible to sign up for a monthly contract.</p>
<p>Prepaid cards or vouchers can be purchased throughout the city and in some provincial towns. If travelling up to the provinces make sure you have enough supply of top up cards as they are likely to be unavailable in more remote areas.</p>
