<li><strong>March 2016:</strong><span> Sierra Leone was finally declared Ebola-free on 7 November 2015 by the WHO. Sadly, another case was identified two months later, but at the time of writing there have been no more incidents. </span></li>
<li><span>Sierra Leone, <span>a country in West Africa,</span> has some 400 km (249 mi) of Atlantic coastline. The coast has areas of low-lying Guinean mangroves swamp. The national capital Freetown sits on a coastal peninsula, situated next to the Sierra Leone Harbour, the world's third largest natural harbour.</span></li>
<li><span><span>The country has a special significance in the history of the transatlantic slave trade as the departure point for thousands of west African captives. The capital, Freetown, was founded as a home for repatriated former slaves in 1787.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>In the 1970s, Sierra Leone was sold by high-street travel agents alongside Gambia as a blissful escape. However the outbreak of civil war in 1991 left the economy in tatters and Sierra Leone’s tourism industry destroyed.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>The civil war ended in <span>2002 with the help of Britain, the former colonial power, and a large United Nations peacekeeping mission.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span>Sierra Leone is often described as a diamond in the rough as t<span>he country is also rich in diamonds and other minerals. The trade in illicit gems, known as "blood diamonds" for their role in funding conflicts, perpetuated the civil war.</span></span></li>
