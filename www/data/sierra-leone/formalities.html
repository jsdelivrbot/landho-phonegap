<div><p><b>January 2016:</b> The Ebola outbreak in the neighbouring countries has now been controlled and the situation reduced to surveillance and monitoring. However Sierra Leone has still not been given the all-clear by the WHO and Ebola cases continue here.</p>
<p><strong>August 2014:</strong> An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is ongoing in West Africa. It is the most severe outbreak of Ebola yet in terms of the number of human cases and fatalities since the discovery of the virus in 1976. The outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013 but was not detected until March 2014, after which it spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
