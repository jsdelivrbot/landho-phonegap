<div><p>The Turks and Caicos Government operates a radar surveillance station that monitors vessels entering and departing their territorial waters.  Vessels entering or leaving the twelve mile limit can contact the station by calling “Provo Radio”. The station operates 24/7 on VHF Channels 16 and 64 and also broadcasts navigational warnings and weather forecasts.</p>
<p>The radar and radio transmitters are mounted on a 40 meter tower located in the South Dock area on Providenciales at 21° 44.44′ N/72° 16.26′ W</p>
<p><span>The<span> </span></span><span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/"><span><strong><span>SailClear</span></strong></span></a></span><span><span> </span></span><span>advance web notification service for clearance is operational. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>When within range of the harbour, try to call the Harbour Master on VHF channel 16. They do not however always monitor the radio, particularly if it is a cruise ship day.</p>
<p>Boats waiting to clear-in can either anchor in the designated anchorage zone or moor alongside the dock and await the boarding officer. Whilst the anchorage is crowded, it is preferable to the dock which is concrete and very high with <span>widely-spaced rusty bollards and rubber tyres. Not designed for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span></span>If necessary, the skipper should go ashore to the office to initiate clearance, but no one else must leave the boat until clearance is complete.</p>
<p>Boarding officers will also give information regarding National Parks Regulations and details of the regulations that affect cruising while in national waters.</p>
<p><strong>Clearance Papers</strong></p>
<p><span>On arrival you will be required to complete a <strong><i>Temporary Importation Declaration</i></strong> (Form C108). </span><span>This is the official </span><span>entrance declaration for the duration of your stay, but is only valid for seven (7) days. This form captures </span><span>details pertaining to crew, passengers and the vessel, and costs $50. </span></p>
<p><span>Subsequently, if the intended stay in </span><span>the Turks and Caicos will exceed seven (7) days, the skipper is then required to purchase a </span><span><strong><i>Cruising Permit </i></strong>(Form C113) which is valid for an additional three (3) months (90 days) at a cost of $300.</span></p>
<p>No more than two 90 day cruising permits will be issued in one calender year. (See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TurksCaicos?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> below).</p>
<p><b>Clearance formalities can be completed at the following ports and marinas:</b></p>
<p><i>Providenciales:</i><br/> South Dock (for Sapodilla Bay anchorage), South Side Marina, Caicos Marina and Shipyard, Turtle Cove Marina, Turks and Caicos YachtClub (Leeward).</p>
<p><i>South Caicos:</i><br/> Government Dock, Seaview Marina</p>
<p><i>Grand Turk:</i><br/> Government Freighter Wharf (south end of the island), Coburn Town Dock (1/4 mile north of radio tower), Flamingo Cove Marina.</p>
<p>Some of the marinas that have difficult entrances can be contacted on channels 16 or 68, either for advice, or they may send out a pilot boat, for which a charge is usually made.</p>
<p><strong>Departure Clearance</strong></p>
<p>All skippers are required to complete an <i><strong>Application for Clearance for </strong><strong>Departure</strong></i> (Form C124) for clearance to their next Port of Call, which will cost $50 USD.</p>
<p><i><strong>Note: </strong>Debit &amp; Credit Cards are now accepted for all transactions.</i></p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Both islands of the Turks &amp; Caicos are an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
