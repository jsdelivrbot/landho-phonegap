<div class="hello"><div><p>Middle (or Grand) Caicos, the largest island in the whole group, boasts three small settlements with a total of about 270 inhabitants and three small guest houses. Caves cut out of the limestone by the original Lucayan Indians are well worth investigating.</p>
<p>This Island has a dramatic coastline and is home to many birds, including frigate birds, flamingos, egrets and sandpipers.</p>
