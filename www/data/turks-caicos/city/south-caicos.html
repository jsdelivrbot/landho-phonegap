<div class="hello"><div><p>South Caicos, one of the smallest islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago, is known for excellent scuba diving, deep sea fishing and bone fishing. The island supports a huge range of sealife from sharks, eagle rays and loggerhead turtle to the smallest organisms in the spectacular coral reefs. This eight square miles of coral rock is a quiet community of approximately 1200 friendly people with an interesting history and intriguing scenery worth exploring.</p>
<p>Cockburn Harbour (not to be confused with Cockburn Town on Grand Turk) is the sleepy little town on this small island. </p>
<p>Location 21°30'N,71°30'W.  </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The bay here is the best natural harbour in the group and is home to the main fishing industry.</p>
<p>There is a concrete dock where it may be possible to moor. There is a minimum depth of 5ft at the seaward end of the dock.</p>
<p>Dinghies can tie up in the basin enclosed by the jetty but the water is filthy. A clean public dinghy dock used by local dive boats can be found at the east end of the harbour close to the environmental studies centre and closer to the Customs office.</p>
