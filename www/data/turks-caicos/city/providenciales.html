<div class="hello"><div><p>Providenciales is now the most developed of the Turks and Caicos 
islands, with the largest population and excellent shopping facilities. 
This island is an excellent, if expensive (clearance fees), place to stop 
for a few days or more on the route south to the Eastern Caribbean or 
north to Florida. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The traditional anchorage for clearance in and out of TCI for transient  vessels is Sapodilla Bay, a moderately well protected bay, except from  the south. Sapodilla Bay 021-44.54N 072-17.30W can be approached from  the west by the Sandbore Channel or from the south via the Caicos Banks.</p>
<p>To clear customs involves a dinghy ride to the beach and a stiff walk  over the hill to the commercial dock at South Dock. <span>In recent years however, there has been a great deal of development on Sapodilla Beach, in particular in the southern part. Getting ashore with your dinghy can be problematic as there are many "private property" signs. See tips in comments at the bottom of the  page.</span></p>
<p><span></span>The alternative is to take your dinghy  around the point to the South Dock (can be a wet ride against the trade  winds), or use clearance services at one of the marinas.</p>
<p>Customs and Immigration clearance can be arranged in advance through Al  Services (649-941-3267).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Most cruising boats anchor in Sapodilla Bay (see details above under clearance). It is an anchorage highly favored by cruising yachtsmen for its convenient depths of eight feet and more right up to the beach. Attention should be paid to the state of the tide.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a great deal of development on Sapodilla Beach, in particular in the southern part. Getting ashore with your dinghy can be problematic as there are many "private property" signs. See tips in comments at bottom of page.</p>
<p>The main town of Provo is quite far and spread out. It is best reached by taxi (can be ordered on channel 68) or rental car (there are several firms that will deliver a car to Sapodilla Bay if contacted by telephone).</p>
<p>Sapodilla Bay is close to the international airport and probably the best place for crew changes.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage on the south coast is Cooper Jack Bay, 21.00.00N, 72.00.00W, just outside South Side Marina.</p>
<p>For vessels wishing to anchor on the North coast there are designated anchorages just off Turtle Cove marina and in the Leeward going through at the eastern end of the island.</p>
<p>There are several marinas, some with clearance facilities (see below), and Caicos Boatyard also has limited docking (plus clearance).</p>
<p>Blue Haven Marina (with on-site clearance), is the newest marina (3 years) located at the northeastern point of the island.</p>

      This brand new marina has on-site clearance facilities and is open to yachts up to 220 feet and a max draft of 8 feet at mean low tide. The marina is positioned within the Blue Haven Resort, surrounded by nearly 20 acres of waterfront land. Marina guests have full access to the Resort, including a hotel boasting a gym, private beach, an infinity-edge swimming pool with lounge decks for entertainment. Also on property will be several restaurants, bars and an array of watersport activities and day charters – both sail and sportfish. SALT, a casual bar and grill, is currently open and a high-end restaurant is expected to open by the year’s end. The fuel dock at the marina is set for completion in July 2013.
