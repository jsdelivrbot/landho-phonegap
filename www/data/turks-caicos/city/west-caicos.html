<div class="hello"><div><p>West Caicos is a prevously uninhabited island situated just south of the Sandbore Channel (the main gateway to the Caicos Banks) and is now being developed as an extremely upscale resort under the management of the Ritz Carlton Group. The hotel and Phase 1 of the residential development is due to open in early 2009.</p>
<p>West Caicos, an important sisal producing center near the turn of the last century, was uninhabited for a very long time, until now. Nelson captured a French sailing vessel off the island in 1777 when he commanded the sloop Little Lucy. </p>
<p>An English entrepreneur owns the only piece of West Caicos land that the government would ever have considered selling, and that includes a silted-up harbor ripe for development into a little yacht basin. Indeed, a three phase 10-year plan is now underway (November 2008) to develop a marina here with a harbour town (in 18th Century style) and a small 5 star hotel (Molasses Reef Hotel by Ritz Carlton Resorts), plus 3 seperate low-density coastal settlements nearby.</p>
<p>A future airport is also planned, however for now the only access to the Island is by boat. Transport around the Island will be by electric golf cart and bicycle.</p>
<p>To ensure that the island remains unspoiled, reports state that approx. 90% of the Island will be preserved as nature reserve.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a useful overnight "anchorage" on the west side of the island at approximately. 21.40.40N, 72.30.30W, where dive boat mooring balls may be used during the night time hours. Anchoring is prohibited.</p>
<p>The marina at the north west corner of West Caicos is scheduled to open in 2011, and although primarily for the use of condo and home owners on the island, it will be open to transient cruisers. Fuel, water and limited shopping are planned.</p>
<p>Marina construction at West Caicos is on hold until the Island Hotel project is finished. Marina channel and basin are dredged and bulk headed but there are no slips for berthing or cleats to tie to, and no water or fuel available. Cruisers have been welcome to anchor in the marina basin, but they must keep clear of the main commercial dock. </p>
