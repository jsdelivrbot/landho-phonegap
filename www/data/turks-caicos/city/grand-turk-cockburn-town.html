<div class="hello"><div><p>Cockburn Town (not to be confused with Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos) is the principal settlement on Grand Turk and is the Capital of the Turks and Caicos. It has many historic buildings and an attractive charm.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of the country see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TurksCaicos?rc=Formalities">Turks &amp; Caicos Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Customs and Immigration are at South Dock (the Government Wharf) and you must clear in here if arriving in the island for the first time, otherwise just show the Harbour Master your Cruising Permit.</p>
<p>Large yachts may be able to tie up to this commercial dock, however it is not advisable as the dock is very high with rusty bollards (widely spaced), overhangs and rough surface and dirty tyres. It is probably better to anchor close by (on the south side) and commute ashore by dinghy.</p>
<p>If the anchorage off Cockburn Town is untenable,  sail two miles south and anchor off the commercial dock at the southern extremity of the island.</p>
<p>To visit the town it is best to ask one of the officials to order a taxi.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor as detailed above. Note, that if you stay<span> anchored in the government harbour too long, your boat may be boarded by the "Police", who will do a brief inspection.</span></p>
<p><strong>Other Anchorages</strong></p>
<p>There is a hurricane hole in the vicinity of Cockburn Town, at North Creek or Columbus Sound, but access is restricted to shallow draft boats.</p>
<p>Hawk's Nest anchorage, south of Cockburn Town, provides good shelter but can only be accessed in good light as the entrance is encumbered with reefs.</p>
<p>South of Grand Turk, on the west side of an island called "The Creek:, is a good sandy anchorage sheltered from easterly winds. Get quite close in, in 3-4m. A very pleasant quiet deserted island.</p>
<p>Grand Turk is now visited regularly by cruise ships, who take preference at the main anchorage.</p>
