<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../solomon-islands-pics/solomon-islands_new-georgia_munda/@@images/image/preview"/>Munda is situated in the picturesque Roviana Lagoon. <span>There are no detailed charts for Roviana Lagoon, but Dirk Selling's guide has good mud maps for getting around. At the time of writing most of the reef markers were in place, but it is recommended to keep a good watch in good visibility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></span></p>
<p>A good anchorage can be found in front of Agnes Gateway Hotel in 8-10 meters, sandy mud, good holding. The hotel management welcomes yachts, has a restaurant and bar, and 24hr security.<br/><i>Photo courtesy of SY Yawana. </i></p>
