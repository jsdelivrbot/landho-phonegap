<div class="hello"><div><p>The Ngellas are situated about 25 NM North of Honiara, Guadalcanal. The chain is composed of the main island, Nggela Sule, as well as a number of smaller islands, including Tulagi, Gavutu and Tanambogo.</p>
<p><span>This island group have suffered in the past with a bad reputation of crime against cruising boats. Whilst it is true there are certain areas that should be avoided, there are a number of anchorages that are making efforts to welcome visiting yachts by installing secure moorings and providing an infrastructure ashore.</span></p>
<p><span><span>These islands offer a beautiful cruising ground and there are several safe all-weather anchorages.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Tulaghi Harbour</strong></p>
<p>The Sesape shipyard here has been undergoing a multi-million dollar refurbishment in recent years, that is now largely complete. It offers international-standard shipyard services, overseen by a NZ shipwright and engineer, including a 500 tonne slip, and a 65 tonne crane and hardstand area. As usual in the Solomons it is best to confirm pricing in writing before going too far out of your way. Email Kim Hamilton (<a href="mailto:kim.hamilton@sisl.com.sb" target="_blank">kim.hamilton@sisl.com.sb</a>) for further information. You can anchor in Tulaghi harbour safely if you speak to Kim first and follow his advice.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>

<p><strong>Roderick Bay</strong></p>
<p>The Roderick Bay yacht club, in Sandfly passage, has been resurrected. The inaugural week-long yacht festival at the end of June is now an annual affair and is a <span>genuine Solomon Islands' cultural experience</span>. Chief <span>John Ruka is trying to change the Islands' bad reputation and cruisers report that Roderick Bay now offers a very safe and secure place for yachts to travel to in these beautiful islands.</span> It is a complete all-weather anchorage and moorings with security are provided by the village. <span>The coral is very much alive and cruisers continue to report that they were made to feel extremely welcome here </span><span>by John and his Clan.</span></p>
<p><strong>Buena Vista Island</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Nugu Beach Resort is a well-managed locally-owned resort in the south-facing inlet of Buena Vista Island, on the north-west end of the Ngellas. Buena Vista is almost directly on a north-south axis with Honiara (take a 7 degree heading from Point Cruz) and is about 32 NM from Honiara. Yachts are welcome and can anchor in front of the resort in approx. 25m of clean sand, with a clear approach from the south straight towards the resort. This is a very well protected anchorage, especially from the north-west monsoon season. The resort provides accommodation, good meals and cold drinks, all at reasonable prices. Nugu Beach is already a popular refuge for long-term yacht stays during the cyclone season - l<span>ong-term stay is negotiable.</span></p>
<p>Email the resort owner Zac: <a href="mailto:zacsepo@gmail.com" target="_blank">zacsepo@gmail.com</a><a href="mailto:zsepo@Customs.gov.sb" target="_blank"><br/></a>Call Zac in Honiara on <a href="tel:%2B677%207477657" target="_blank">+677 7477657</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Security in the Nggelas</strong></p>
<p>Security is reported to be better in Buena Vista than elsewhere in the Nggelas, as it is further away from the more densely settled parts of Big Nggela. Assured higher-level security can be hired through the resort. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>

<p>Reliable information and advice about cruising the Nggelas can be had from Fred Douglas, the owner and manager of Extreme Adventures, in Honiara. Fred can also recommend a local to accompany the yacht as it moves around the Ngellas. It will only cost about US$10-12 per day, but it will provide peace of mind, and considerably lower risk.</p>
