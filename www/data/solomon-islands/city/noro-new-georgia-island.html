<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of these Islands see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SolomonIslands?rc=Formalities">Solomon Islands Formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p>This is a Port of Entry and the necessary officials for clearing in and out are based here (Customs, Immigration, Health and Quarantine).</p>
<p>It has been reported by cruisers that <span>Noro is now the preferred port of entry into the Western Province as Gizo has been experiencing reports of theft, and the Immigration officer is extremely uncooperative and rarely available. </span></p>
<p>The Immigration officer at Noro is the most senior in the Solomon Islands. He is called Billy and can be contacted on +6777495010. Cruisers recommend this is a good telephone number to have if you leave your yacht in the Solomons and have to return with only a single ticket. You won't be allowed on the flight, but a call to Billy will get you on.</p>
<p>Advice is to begin check in early as it takes most of the day and is a lengthy process. Clearance fees are charged according to the boat length and are quite high.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This port has several safe anchorages and is a very useful port for both clearing in and out.</p>
<p>The nearest repair facilities are at Liapari on the island of Vella Lavela.</p>
