<p><span>Only Customs and Quarantine clearance can be </span><span>completed here as there is no Immigration Officer. Immigration can be flown in, but at your own expense. If </span><span>you are lucky and a cruise ship is in port, Immigration will be present. </span></p>
<p><span>Once formalities with Customs and </span><span>Quarantine are completd you should report to the police station and inform them where you intend to </span><span>check-in with Immigration (Honiara is the closest). </span></p>
<p><span>They should notify the officials – make sure you ask for proof this has been </span><span>done as cruisers have encountered problems in the past.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p id="content"><strong>Lata Town</strong></p>
<p><span>There is a jetty at Lata (Approx. position: 10 43.239S 165 48.129E), but it is not </span><span>recommended to tie to this. </span></p>
<p><span>The anchorage is very deep, exposed, and the ground is reported as </span><span>fouled. </span></p>
<p><span>One option is to hold off and launch the dinghy and have someone go ashore to find the </span><span>officials. Friendly locals will help and show you the way. The officials will either come straight to your </span><span>boat or meet you later at the anchorage at Shaw Point. You will have to pay a small fee for their </span><span>transport.</span></p>
<p><span>Another option is to anchor at Shaw Point and then dinghy the 1.7NM to town. Your </span><span>decision will probably be dictated by the fact that the wind gets up later in the morning making for a bumpy dinghy ride. </span></p>
<p><strong>Shaw Point</strong></p>
<p>The anchorage at Shaw Point (Approx.: 10 44.23S 165 49.70E) is well sheltered but deep and the bottom is rock and coral.</p>
<p>A better anchorage is in the SE corner (Approx.: 10 45.58S 165 49.35E) which while still deep is near a river and has mud holding. This anchorage is further from town, so make sure you have checked in first. A man called Titus (Tel: +677 7732594) looks after yachties and will canoe to you. He enjoys the company of yachties and will happily show you around town and look after your needs. He doesn’t expect anything in return, but clothes or a gift are of course appreciated.</p>
