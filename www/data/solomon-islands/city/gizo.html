<div class="hello"><div><p>Gizo is the second largest city in the Solomons, but it is much smaller than Honiara. Motor traffic is so light that most drivers use the middle of the road! It is on the southern tip of the island of the same name and lies south of the island of Vella Lavella.</p>
<p>The Gizo area, including the many small islands southeast of the island of Ghizo, is laced with reefs. The waters have red and green navigation markers and occasionally various posts and sticks. However, a few markers are no longer in place.</p>
<p><span>Not all charts are accurate and the use of satellite images to </span><span>help with navigation is recommended.</span></p>
<p>Location: 08° 06' S, 156° 50' 34"E.</p></div></div>

<p>Gizo has Customs, Agriculture and Health and Immigration officers (supposedly) working seven days a week.</p>
<p>Customs will not check you out unless Immigration has also done so.</p>
<p><span>Latest reports from cruisers in the area is that Noro (New Georgia) is now the preferred port of entry into the Western Province of the Solomons, as Gizo has been experiencing reports of theft, and the Immigration officer is extremely unco-operative and rarely available.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at Gizo is exposed to the East and Southeast but the holding is generally good. <span>The waterfront bars are open until the early hours and play loud music, so you may wish to anchor in one of the bays further north if you like to sleep. Fatboys and Sanbis resorts welcome yachts.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The best anchorage is near the local market </span><span>where there is a jetty to which you can tie your dinghy (Approx. position: 08 06.19S 156 50.64E). From here you are </span><span>highly visible. Cruisers recommend not anchoring outside the PT109 restaurant as there have been </span><span>recent thefts here.</span></p>
<p>The nearby island of <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SolomonIslands/liapari">Liapari </a></strong>(14 miles away) has a secure anchorage where the yacht can be left. Liapari Ltd., a boatyard/docking facility r<span>un by Noel and Rose Hudson, </span>offers security and a number of services, improving all the time.</p>
