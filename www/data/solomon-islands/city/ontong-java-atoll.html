<div class="hello"><div><p>This remote atoll is one of the largest ones in the world, being boot-shaped and about 35 miles long from north to south and the same east to west. It lies 200 miles north of the nearest of the other Solomon Islands, but just 25 miles east of  the Papua New Guinea island of Nukumanu. Although made up of over 120 islets, the two largest are Luaniua at southern end and Pelau on the northeastern side.</p>
<p>The principle activities of the island are harvesting coconuts, producing copra and fishing.</p>
<p>Position 5° 31.4'S, 159°37.5'E. (entrance to the southern pass).</p>

<p>Report to the Chief in Luaniua. A gift, in either money or goods (or both) is expected.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The light ships are not in positions indicated by C-maps, but there are some there. </p>
<p>The southern pass into the lagoon is deep and very wide, but watch for two shallow-ish areas each side. It shallows to 50 feet once inside the lagoon. There is no noticable current through this pass.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage behind the island of Luaniua in 7 to 10m but it is necessary to search for a sandy patch among the coral and, perhaps to anchor fore and aft to prevent the chain wrapping round the coral heads.</p>
