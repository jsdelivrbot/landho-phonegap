<div class="hello"><div><p>Liapari Island borders the southern end of Vella Lavella Island in the Western Province. It is just 14 miles from<strong> <a class="external-link" href="http://noonsite.com/Countries/SolomonIslands/Gizo">Gizo</a></strong>, the second largest city in the Solomons.</p>
<p><span>There are dozens of sandy and coral island anchorages and diving spots close to Liapari including Kennedy Island (where the President swam to after being shipwrecked). Cruisers recommend this as a base for Cyclone season.</span></p>
<p><span>Noel and Rose Hudson of Liapari Ltd. have been operating a 200-ton slipway here for 26 years, and now have a <span>60-ton slipway for yachts and a</span> 100 foot dock. </span><span>Noel has been recommended by many cruisers and is well known for good </span><span>service at good prices. This is also an easy place to ship parts to and Noel will help arrange this.</span></p>
<p><span>The channel leading to this marine facility has a depth of 11 feet at high tide. </span></p>
<p><span>Position° <span>07° 56.8' S, </span><span>156°  42.8 E.</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The harbour at Liapari is created by the natural lee of Vella Levalla, Liapari Island and the fringing reef and islets to the East. </span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers recommend this as a safe Cyclone hole, with good holding and a comfortable anchorage. The shallow area for anchoring is </span><span>well inside the main reef next to</span><span> the man made cutting on the inner reef.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Entering the Lagoon</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The following from yacht Adina, who visited in 2015:</span><span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>You should ideally have satellite images to enter the lagoon which is actually a </span><span>double lagoon and is poorly charted. The outer entrance (Pos: 07 56.365S 156 43.298E) is marked by posts, </span><span>after which you need to head North West to (07 56.1888S 156 42.9385E) before turning south to the </span><span>second pass at (07 56.4137S 156 42.8788E). </span></p>
<p><span>The second pass is man-made and narrow/shallow, </span><span>although it is well posted - favour the left hand side. Best to enter 2 hours either side of HW. </span></p>
<p><span>Call </span><span>Liapari on VHF16 to check if it is ok to enter. Otherwise anchor near the pass until it is ok to go through.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mooring</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong></span><span>There is a choice of anchoring in the harbour or Mediterranean style mooring for a small fee on Noel's dock. This facility is very clean and tidy with beautiful lawns and grounds and a laundry right next to the dock. There is an open air bar at 'the round house' and plans for a new three story bar and restaurant with accommodation, which should be completed by 2018.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ashore</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is a remote island with a 14 mile journey to Gizo for banks, supplies and <span>connections to Honiara's international airport. </span><span>Transport/Transfers are available on request however at a daily rate and every Thursday is shopping day when the marina charge only a fare rate. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There are no bikes, taxis or buses on the island, but there is on Gizo Island, as well as an ANZ bank and Bank of South Pacific, good stores to resupply and a fresh food market. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Internet has been installed in Gizo but has been slow. WiFi is now available at Gizo Hotel with a password available from reception.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>There are a variety of markets and hardware stores in Liapari and Gizo.</span></p>
