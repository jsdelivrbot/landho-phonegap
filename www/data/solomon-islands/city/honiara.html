<div class="hello"><div><p>Honiara lies on the north east coast of the island of Guadalcanal. It is the capital of the Solomon Islands. During the last two decades it has suffered many riots and parts of the town have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Position 09° 25'37"E, 159° 57'22"E (harbour approach)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into and out of these Islands see </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SolomonIslands/Noro/Countries/SolomonIslands?rc=Formalities">Solomon Islands Formalities</a></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>Yachts entering the Solomon Islands should anchor near the Point Cruz Yacht Club and go ashore to contact the relevant officials. Ashore, customs can be found at the commercial wharf (to the left out of the yacht club) and immigration about 1/2 km past the Mendana Hotel opposite the Post Office. A phone number is posted at the Yacht Club dinghy dock for Quarantine.</p>
<p>Formalities - full range of officials - customs, immigration, health, quantantine.</p>
<p>This is one of two places (Noro being the other) where it's possible to clear in with all officials on the same day. However, cruisers advise you begin check in early as it takes most of the day (with officials being in 3 different places) and is a lengthy process.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Both entrance buoys into Mbokona Bay are now in place.</p>
<p>For safe passage into the bay. visitors need to line up either;<br/> a) the flagpole at the YC<br/> or<br/> b) the left hand side of the blue 6 story building behind the YC with the orange pole on top of the hill behind. It is about 10 feet high and 2 ft around and has a slow flashing light on top.</p>
<p><strong>Mooring Buoys</strong><br/> There is just one mooring ball available for hire. It is yellow and is on the west side of the bay (see <span> notice board at Point Cruz Yacht Club)</span>. Be careful when approaching it as the reef is not far behind.</p>
<p>There is another mooring which may be available for hire. Contact Henk, owner of SV Aurora, in Mbokona Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/>Most yachts now anchor swinging free near the yellow mooring ball on the West side of the bay.</p>
<p>Free anchorage is available at Point Cruz near the Yacht Club, however swinging room is limited by the reefs and the manoeuvring room required for the patrol boats at their wharf</p>
<p><span>Anchoring stern up to the sea wall seems harder than it used to be, as this space is currently taken up by local charter boats who have their own moorings laid off the seawall. There is also a new big dock in the middle that has recently been constructed and takes up a fair amount of space. Anchoring and stern tying to the sea wall still looks possible, but probably for only 2 or 3 boats.</span></p>
<p>The depth in the bay rises quickly to the reef. The bottom is a silty / sandy mix which, many times, has proved to be very poor holding ground.</p>
<p>Be aware if you choose to anchor on either the west side or in the middle of the bay.  Strong winds come up quickly, for no apparent reason, from the North or North East and cause total chaos. It is not advisable to leave the yacht unattended.</p>
<p>Anchoring is possible either side of the point, the most suitable depends on the wind direction.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong><br/> There is significant motor-canoe traffic in this area and security may be an issue at night. As with many anchorages, it is advisable to hoist one's dinghy out of the water and to lock it to the boat. The engine and fuel tank should be locked to the dinghy as well. Loose items should not be left on deck at any time. Burglaries from boats (dive gear) were reported from here in October 2011. It is advisable to return to your boat before dark. Hiring a local you know and trust for security may be advisable.</p>
