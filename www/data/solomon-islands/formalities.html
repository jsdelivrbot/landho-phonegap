<div><p><strong>Clearing - In</strong></p>
<p>Clear in at an official Port of Entry first. On arrival, immediately report to the authorities and request clearance.  This is usually staight forward, but obtaining a clearance pack before arrival  will speed up the process. See <a href="http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Divisions/Immigration/Forms/yacht.pdf"><strong>www.commerce.gov.sb</strong></a> to download the forms.</p>
<p>Stopping and going ashore at any island before clearing in is strictly  prohibited and boats that do this will pay a heavy fine. This is particularly  true of the eastern islands, such as Tikopia or Vanikolo, where yachts coming  from Vanuatu have stopped without first clearing into the Solomons at Ndende  (Nendo) Island.</p>
<p>Whilst Noonsite has received reports from cruisers who successfully anchored in  several places in the eastern and western Solomons before officially checking in  (not encountering enforcement boats), it is recommended to not take the risk of  being fined.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Lata%28GraciosaBay%29">Lata</a></strong> (Nendo/Ndende Island, Santa Cruz) only has C</span><span>ustoms and Quarantine. You will need to attend Immigration in Honiara.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clearing - Out</strong></p>
<p>Clearance out of the Solomons can be done from any Port of Entry.</p>
<p>Note that clearance fees and, for some places, anchorage fees are now being  collected. See "<strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong>" below for the latest details.</p>

<div><p>Passports are required by all visitors and must be valid for 6 months beyond your stay.</p>
<p>Visas are not required for up to a three month stay for U.S., British Commonwealth and most European citizens, but there is an extensive list of nationals from various countries who do require prior approval before visiting the islands.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Divisions/Immigration/Immigration_Requirements.htm"><strong>Updated list</strong></a></p>
<p>Nationals of countries who do require a visa must apply to the Director of Immigration (see details below).</p>
<p>A visitors permit will be issued for a period not exceeding three months in any period of twelve months. Extensions can be obtained for up to another 3 months if there are special circumstances, for which there is a fee of SBD$30 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Arriving by Plane</strong></p>
<p>Crew who plan to  arrive in the Solomon Islands by plane and to depart on a yacht should apply for a visitor’s permit to the Director of Immigration <strong>before</strong> their arrival.  The application should state the crew’s arrival date, vessel name and registration details, vessel’s arrival date, approximate length of time the crew member will spend in the Solomon Islands, and it should request entry on a one-way (arrival only) airline ticket.  The Director will issue a permit to be presented at airline check-in.  If the crew member does not have this permit, they may be denied boarding.</p>
<p>In Dec 2010, new visa requirements were being considered which will require <strong>ALL</strong> visitors to obtain a visa in advance of arrival. It is planned that such visas will be obtainable via the internet but as yet, there is no timetable for implementation.</p>

<div><p>Malaria is endemic in the Solomons and malarial prophylaxis is absolutely essential. Many cruising sailors have caught malaria in the Solomons recently, so the usual precautions should also be taken, such as having mosquito screens on all portholes and hatches, anchoring further offshore and possibly upwind from any village, trying to avoid going ashore in the late afternoon or early evening when mosquitoes are most active.</p>
<p>Tap water is not potable and should be treated everywhere including Honiara and Gizo.</p>
<p>The hospitals often run out of basic supplies such as antibiotics and blood supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Danger - Crocodiles</strong></p>
<p>Salt water crocodiles are native to parts of the Solomon Islands, and there have been sightings on beaches. <span>On arrival in any new place, ensure you ask locals whether there are any crocodiles. Local advice </span><span>should be sought before entering unfamiliar waters, including lakes.</span></p></div>
