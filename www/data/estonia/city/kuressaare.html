<div class="hello"><div><p>A convenient port at which to enter (or leave) Estonia. The port lies on the southern coast of the island of Saarema (Estonia's biggest island), which itself is situated at the head of the Gulf of Riga.</p>
<p><span>Saaremaa boasts a long maritime tradition. The Antarctica explorer - Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen - was born here and is probably the most prominent seafarer among the island’s sailors.</span></p>
<p><span>In the 20th century Saaremaa was a closed island for many decades with restricted access for even Estonians due to the Soviet military presence. It now has much to offer hosting an Opera Festival, Maritime Week and other summer events.</span></p>

<p>The berthing here on floating pontoons. The Harbour Master, Oskar, is very friendly and helpful.</p>
