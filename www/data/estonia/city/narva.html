<div class="hello"><div><p>Narva town yacht harbour is situated 14 km up river from the entrance. There are no official charts for Narva River, but it is safe if you keep to the middle and to the outside of the bends. The depth varies between 3.4 and 8.7 m. The frontier between Estonia and Russia is along the river, so it is wise to avoid approaching too closely to the eastern shore.</p>
<p>There is good, all-round shelter here.</p>
