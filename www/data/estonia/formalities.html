<div><p>All Estonian harbours are now open to foreign yachts, including the old Russian naval base at Paldiski.</p>
<p>There are no formalities required for yachts arriving from or departing to other countries within the Schengen area and all ports with clearance facilities are "Ports of Entry".</p>
<p>Yachts travelling between Estonia and Russia and from outside the Schengen Area are still subject to the usual formalities but check which Estonian ports have clearance facilities.</p>
