<p><span>Anchor near the jetty. The captain should go ashore for clearance (it is best to inform the port captain on your arrival by VHF). Yachts should inform the authorities of their intended route while in Chilean waters and make a daily report on VHF Ch 16.</span></p></div></div>

<p><span>There are technicians here that could help with repairs if required, knowledge of the language and time to do your research recommended. Nothing is central however and whilst supplies are available, again, they are not straightfoward to obtain. Reach out to the sailing community here for information.</span></p>
<p><span>There are 2 yards with travelifts (50T), o<span>ne north of town 8km and one south of town 8km. </span>It is very difficult in summer, better in winter as winds die out completely for long periods. There is also a marine railway, a syncrolift and a crane. Yachts seldom use these facilities. </span></p>
