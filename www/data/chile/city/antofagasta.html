<div class="hello"><div><p>The yacht club here is reported to be very welcoming. A good place to leave the boat if heading inland to explore, however <span>currently it's not possible to leave your boat unattended here. Repair</span><span> work is being done on the yacht club pontoons after a storm in the winter of 2014 caused alot of damage.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../chile-pics/chile_antofagasta_yacht-club-pontoon/@@images/image/preview"/>Currently it is possible to pick up a mooring buoy, fore and aft, off the yacht club, just inside the breakwater (<i>see photo courtesy of Michael Marshall 2015</i>). Good protection and very helpful staff in the yacht club.</p>
<p><span>It is worth trying to hail the yacht club on VHF Ch.16 if you speak Spanish, however yachts have reported having to shout to hail the "Lancha" for assistance, and getting no response on the VHF.</span></p>
<p>The yacht club has a launch, but your own dinghy would be better.</p>
<p><span>Non potable water available from long hose from yacht club. </span><span>Clean fuel available from stations in town using jerry can. Yacht club can assist with obtaining large quantities.</span></p>
<p><span>Laundry, excellent provisioning, and Sodimac Home Center in nearby mall.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a travelift here, however following the 2014 winter storms, it is currently not operational.</span></p>
