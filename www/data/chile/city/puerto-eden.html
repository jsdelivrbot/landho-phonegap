<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a good anchorage in the NE corner of the bay by the village. It is possible to use the wharf but depths are shallow (2.5m) and there is frequent traffic.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage can be found in the northern corner of Caleta Malacca but beware of the power cable at the entrance with a clearance of 14.5m at HW.</p>
