<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of Chile see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities">Chile Formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p>Contact the port captain on Channel 16 and follow berthing instructions. It's advisable to proceed directly to the Yacht Club and avoid the commercial port.</p>
<p>Check in here is reported to be friendly and the Armada most helpful. A sanitary inspection with the <span>Maritime Health Department</span> is required here, and costs charged seem to vary. Cruisers report being charged between USD 270 and USD 425 for boats clearing into Chile here. This appears to be the only port of entry going south that makes this charge.</p>
