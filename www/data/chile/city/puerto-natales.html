<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying on the eastern shore of Canal Senoret, the town is a useful stop for a visit to the Balmaceda and Serrano glaciers. It is only a few miles from the Argentinian border.</p>
<p>A new marina is in the planning, however no work has yet started. A new boatyard is due to open here in December 2016.</p>
<p>Position 51° 44'S, 72° 31'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The mooring options here are not very good. Most being exposed to winds from both N/NW and SW. The best option is Terminal Presquero, to the south of the town, even though this is very crowded with fishing boats.</p>
<p><span>There are other options to tie up to a variety of piers in Natales, but they are all commercial ones. However, with proper preparation and equipment it is possible if there is an emergency or a some kind of repair situation. Contact t</span><span>he Port Captain as he controls the movement of all vessels. </span></p>
<p>It is best to assume you will have to anchor here. There is a possible anchorage opposite the town, in the bay of Puerto Laforest. This is partly occupied by a salmon farm and it shoals rapidly, but the holding is good. It is a mile long dinghy ride across to the town and in the 25 to 30 knot winds which can whip up during the afternoon, it can be dangerous.</p>
<p>A new boatyard with a 50 ton travelift is due to open here in December 2016. Until then, the Fishing Co-Op will haul yachts.</p>
<p>See comments on hauling out here at bottom of page.</p>

      The best option is either to raft up to a fishing boat at the pier end or to anchor in the basin formed by pier and the shore, but beware of the many lines connecting the boats to their safety anchors. There are some water taps and a shower block by the office.
