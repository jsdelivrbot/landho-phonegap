<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a port of entry. <span>For full details on clearing into and out of Chile see </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities">Chile Formalities</a></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>After entering the Rio Valdivia at Corral, call the harbour authorities on VHF channel 16.</p>
<p>The town of Valdivia, where formalities are completed, lies about 11 miles up the river. It is usually possible to also clear in at Alwoplast, which is only halfway up the river, although occasionally the Navy will insist that a boat comes up river into Valdivia itself and moors on the dock in front of the port captain's office.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The main marina of Yacht Club Valdivia in the town can get very busy and may not have room, so it is best to contact them in advance. It is worth noting however that this marina is on a lee shore and larger boats (more than 35 feet) <span>are moored outside on a hammerhead, subject to waves and wind.</span></p>
<p><span></span>The Yacht Club have a second marina further away in Estancilla which might be a better alternative for larger yachts, or those with more than 2m draft. in 2015 this marina is being expanded.</p>
<p><span>There is a frequent bus service from Estancilla to town and takes 10 mintues. Both marinas have WiFi. </span></p>
<p>Another option for docking is Puerto Montt, some 150 nm further south.</p>
