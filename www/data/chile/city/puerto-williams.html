<div class="hello"><div><p>See full details on clearing into and out of Chile at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities">Chile Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Yachts entering the Beagle Channel area should contact the Chilean Navy on VHF Channel 16. Puerto Williams is a naval base, but yachts are welcomed there. Cruising boats are usually told to proceed directly into the small western basin, close to the airport, where there is a concrete dock. Shallow-drafted boats may come on its inside, or tie up alongside the Micalvi, a former supply ship, now used as a yacht club by the locals.</p>
<p><span>The port captain of Puerto William requires any yacht whose registration papers state their gross weight is in excess of 50 Tonnes, to use a harbour pilot. See comment below.</span></p>
<p>Recently "SAG" (the authorities responsible for avoiding alien flora and fauna arriving on Chilean soil) have started implementing a law that no fresh fruit, vegetables or meat can be brought into the country. Any on board will be confiscated and destroyed. Fines for not complying may be introduced. This law is enforced in the rest of Chile, however it has only been introduced in PW in 2016. This will cause problems for boats who visit Ushuaia for re-provisioning due to the unreliable supplies in Puerto Williams. See the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Clearance</a></strong> section for more details.</p>
<p>Officials will visit the boat here, after which the captain must go to the port captain's office to complete formalities. It is essential that those for whom this is the first port of entry into Chile insist on being given the compulsory Customs certificate. Those who leave without it will have serious problems when clearing out of Chile.</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>See main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> section for standard charges.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>Yachts should inform the authorities of their intended route while in Chilean waters and, when practical, make a daily report on VHF Ch 16. In an effort to "more closely control foreign vessels", further Clearance rules apply for local trips from Puerto Williams (for exampe to the Horn and the glaciers and up the Beagle Channel). See<strong> <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Chile?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Clearance</a></strong> departure section for more details.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-right" src="Countries/MiclaviYC_SerraLautaBay.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>There is an anchorage in Seno Lauta, with good holding, but exposed to both easterly and westerly winds. It is free, but requires permission from the Port Captain.</span></p>
<p><span></span>The most pleasant, and safest berths are at the <strong>Club Naval de Yates Micalvi</strong>. It is based in a small inlet at the western end of the harbour. Yachts <span style="text-align: justify; ">moor alongside an old Chilean Navy ship that is grounded at Seno Lauta to serve as a Pontoon. Yacht club facilities (such as WiFi, showers, bathroom, electricity and Club House) are located in this historical ship. </span></p>
<p>This port can be closed in really bad weather.</p>
<p><span>A new Fisherman’s Coop Port, meant to open by 2015, is still under construction. According to the Mayor of Puerto Williams the fishermen want yachts to use the facilities to offset the costs of the maintenance. The project however looks to be a long way from opening.</span></p>
