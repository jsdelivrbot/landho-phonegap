<div><p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p><strong>Foreign vessels arriving directly from a foreign port</strong> must immediately contact the port captain (Capitania del Puerto) on Channel 16. No one must disembark until this has been authorised by the maritime authority, whose representative will visit the boat accompanied by immigration (Policia de Investigaciones) and quarantine (Servicio de Salud). Once these formalities have been completed, the captain must visit Customs (see below).</p>
<p>Regulations state that foreign yachts must have a pilot on board, unless they are fully insured. Recently, requesting proof of insurance has generally been abandoned due to the difficulty of identifying genuine valid papers. Yachts requiring emergency help from the Chilean Navy or using the Chilean SAR may have to pay for these services.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign vessels arriving from another Chilean port</strong> must immediately contact the port captain on Channel 16, who will inform the captain of the vessel that within two hours he needs to visit the maritime authority office to report his arrival.</p>
<p><span>Chilean waters are not free to roam. The Armada de Chile (the Navy) controls all movement and they</span> keep a close watch on foreign yachts and insists on a detailed itinerary listing every overnight anchorage. Indicating which channels you intended to use is often sufficient. When listing ETAs at various ports/anchorages it is better to arrive earlier rather than later than the estimated date.</p>
<p>It is advisable to try to contact the naval authorities on HF radio (if you have one) before entering Chilean territorial waters, which both Chile and Peru consider as extending to 200 miles offshore. It may be better to report to the Chilean Navy (Armada) via email (instead of radio), to <a href="mailto:mrccchilr@directemar.cl"><strong>mrccchilr@directemar.cl</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Quarantine Regulations</strong></p>
<p><strong>From January 2016</strong>, "SAG" (the authority responsible for preventing the introduction of alien flora and fauna into Chile) has implemented the law requiring the declaration of any fresh fruit, vegetables, meat or other animal products on board. Any such item may be confiscated and destroyed. There is a fine for not declaring such items. Currently US$4500 (Jan 2016).<br/> 'Everyone' (and this appears to be the crew as well as the skipper) must make this declaration. The form, <a href="http://www.sag.cl/sites/default/files/f-iit-ing-001_declaracion_jurada_conjunta_aduana_sag_02.pdf"><strong>“Joint CUSTOMS-SAG sworn declaration”</strong></a> can also be given to you on arrival. <br/> This procedure may have to be repeated at every Chilean port visited.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>The exit permit (zarpe) for vessels leaving either for another Chilean port or a foreign destination must be requested by the captain, who must personally visit the port captain's office 24 hours before the intended departure time. On the day of departure, an official from the port captain's office will bring the permit to the boat. After this, the vessel must leave within one hour, otherwise the exit permit will be cancelled. In practice, the permit may be collected from the office on the day of departure.</p>
<p>In an effort to "more closely control foreign vessels", further Clearance rules apply which vary from port to port:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Puerto Williams, now, if leaving for local trips (The Horn and the glaciers), a maximum 10 day only zarpe will be issued. </li>
<li>Boats may get into trouble by not going through the correct procedure when leaving Puerto Williams for Ushuaia, in neighbouring Argentina, a routine trip which many boats do on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Those intending to cruise northwards through the Beagle Channel may not stop at Ushuaia, if they do, they must return to Puerto Williams to go through all the formalities again.</li>
<li>
<div>For cruising the Beagle Channel from Puerto Williams, no zarpe is required for trips to Lapataia and Islas Bridges, <span>but the Prefectura must be notified before you leave and given details of your trip. Any trip</span><span> further out into the Beagle Channel requires a zarpe.</span></div>
</li>
<li>In Puerto Montt zarpes will be issued all the way to Puerto Williams, however the Armada will request that a daily check-in is made to monitor movements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visas are normally granted for stays of 90 days, but it it possible to extend this for another 90 days for a cost of US$100.</p>
<p>As visa requirements may be changed, it is advisable to check with a Chilean embassy or consulate before arrival.</p>

<p>Any foreign yacht entering Chile gets a 90 day temporary import permit. This is renewable for a further 90 days and again up to one year without issue, and possibly beyond in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>If a vessel is left and the owner travels abroad, a nominated Chilean resident should have power of attorney notarized and this be lodged with the nearest Customs authority.</p>
<p>If the temporary import comes up for renewal, it can only be extended by the owner/Captain if he/she is in Chile at the time. Otherwise the nominated resident individual will have to apply for the extensions.</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared.</p>

<div><p>A cruising permit is issued to visiting yachts when clearing into Chile. The permit must be presented to officials at every port of call and is usually retained by the port captain until departure. A detailed itinerary must be submitted. Yachts cruising the southern archipelago have found the officials in Castro to be the most cooperative, not insisting on a precise cruising plan and issuing an open permit valid for two or three months provided a designated port was visited at the end of the proposed itinerary.</p>

<div><p><strong>Yachts up to 25 tons:</strong> Each time a yacht <strong>enters or leaves the country</strong> it must pay US$3.11.</p>
<p><strong>Yachts from 25 to 1000 tons:</strong> Each time a yacht <strong>enters or leaves a Chilean port or marina</strong> it must pay US$51.00.</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> A yacht less than 25 tons of TRG must pay this tax only when it enters or leaves the country. A yacht more than 25 tons of TRG must pay each time it enters or leaves a port of Chile, even when it sails in Chilean waters without leaving the country.</p>
<p>All foreign yachts must pay lighthouse and beacon fees (Faros y Balisas). These are: US$2.50 per year or US$0.98 per ton for one trip.</p>
<p><span>Overtime is also charged outside normal working hours. These are Monday to Friday 0700 - 1900 and Saturday 0700 - 1300. The charge is 50% more than the standard rate.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Fees clearing in at Arica:<br/>March 2016: US<span>$450</span><br/>April 2015: US$27<br/></i></span><i>July 2014: US$425 </i><i> (coming from Peru). <br/>While a French boat in Puerto Montt (arriving from New Caledonia) did not pay anything.

            </h2>
<div><p>Access to the Chilean channels without a permit is prohibited. Both the lighthouse keepers and Navy keep an eye on yacht movement.</p>
<p>CHILREP: Boats must report their position to the nearest radio station at 0800 and 2000 local time daily. The frequencies to be used should be ascertained locally. Usually one can report on SSB 4146 kHZ, VHF Ch 16 or by email <a href="mailto:mrccchilr@directemar.cl">mrccchilr@directemar.cl</a></p>
<p>The report must contain the following information: yacht name; call signal; date and time; position in lat and long; course and speed.</p>
<p>The Navy will monitor the progress of cruising boats and insists on being kept updated on one's progress, primarily for one's own safety.</p>
<p>There are restricted areas in Puerto Chacabuco and Puerto Williams. The port captain must be informed if a yacht wishes to move to another anchorage within those harbours. </p>
<p>Some parts of the Patagonian channels are prohibited to yachts.</p>
