<div><p>International dialing code for Chile is +56.</p>
<p>VHF is required by the Armada, and you are required to check in with position and ETA to next port where there is a Armada post, twice daily while underway or at anchor at 0800 and 2000 hrs.  Often you are out of VHF range, however you can speak with other ships and lighthouses to forward your position.  </p>
<p>You can also check in using the HI-FI radio on channel 4146.0 KHZ.  </p>
<p>It's likely if you try to check in via email these will be returned.  </p>
<p>It's recommended to keep a daily Radio Log of all attempts and contacts. </p>
<p>A Chile prepaid SIM card with a GSM international cell phone is the most convenient and economical solution. All incoming calls, while in Chile are FREE, regardless of where they originate. Pay the local rate for local calls. </p>
<p>A local cell phone with purchased phone cards is very useful while ashore.  There are also many call centers and internet cafes in the major ports for easy and cost effective communication abroad.</p>
