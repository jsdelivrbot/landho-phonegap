<p>Immigration requirements for Guam and the Northern Marianas are, in general, the same as for mainland USA. See <strong><a href="Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Noonsite/USA/Immigration</a>. </strong><strong>This, therefore, requires visitors arriving by yacht to have a US visa in advance of arrival. </strong></p>
<p>From 2015, t<span>he new Guam-CNMI VWP (Visa Waiver Program) will allow an authorized period of stay of up to 45 days when arriving by commercial carrier.</span></p>
<p><span>Possession </span><span>of a US visa will permit entry by citizens of most countries, <strong>except</strong> that people from the following countries, <strong>cannot enter</strong> the Northern Mariana Islands at all (so also no visa is granted whatsoever):-<br/>Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cuba, Egypt, Eritrea, Fujian Province of China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Myanmar, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. </span></p>
