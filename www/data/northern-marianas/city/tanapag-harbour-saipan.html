<div class="hello"><div><p>Avoid entering port for clearance on weekends as the overtime charges are fairly hefty. The approaches to the harbour are well marked.</p>
<p>Customs, Immigration and Quarantine can be done at the marina. <span>The main wharf (Charlie dock) attracts a US$30 fee, although Clearance is possible here. Contact the Port Captain on VHF Ch. 16 for directions on where to moor.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Smiling Cove Marina</b>, located north of the American Memorial Park in Garapan, is reasonably well protected, but is not safe in a typhoon. Services for transient yachts have ceased and cruisers report that the situation does not like it will improve.</p>
<p><b>Outer Cove Marina</b>, located on the east of the island in Tanapag harbour, almost due west of Monagaha Island, was built in 2008 and has fixed concrete docks. Fuel, ice and supplies from a mobile store are available.</p>
<p>The inner harbour does provide good shelter, but it is on a first come, first served basis and gets very crowded.</p>

      The entrance to the marina channel is fairly
tight and the deep water is found by keeping the wall at the entrance and along the channel close to Port. The high tide depth in the basin is 10 to 14 feet. Transient berth available, however no services.  Toilets (no showers) - often out of order. Rats can be a problem. US$8/day for a 38ft boat (2013).
