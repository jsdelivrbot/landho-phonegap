<ul>
<li>There is about 13 miles (21 km) of coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba, at the head of which is Aqaba, Jordan's only seaport. Most of Jordan is desert, with a dry raised plateau stretching down the centre of the country.</li>
<li>Cruising yachts have started visiting this interesting country and although the coastline itself has little to offer this is more than made up for by the attractions of the interior. </li>
<li>Most boats that visit Jordan do so at the end of a passage up the Red Sea and the detour into the Gulf of Aqaba, before transiting the Suez Canal, is more than justified by the chance to visit not only Jordan but possibly also neighbouring Eilat in Israel. However, for the time being those who wish to call at both countries would be wiser to visit Aqaba first and then Eilat, first sailing out into international waters. Up until now yachts coming from Eilat have been refused entry into Jordan.</li>

<div><p>Generally levels of crime are low in Jordan, but women should be careful to  avoid situations where they might become victims of sexual assault. Advice from  the Jordanian police is that, anyone who finds themselves stranded - even in  daytime - should call the police (191 or 192). The police will then take them to a place of safety.</p></div>
