<div><p>The authorities must be advised of the yacht's ETA and the vessel must proceed without stopping to an official port of entry. Boats coming from the south should keep well away from the Burmese coast after leaving Thai territorial waters and only head inshore when ready to enter Kawthaung (Victoria Point) harbour.</p>
<p>Stopping at any islands is prohibited and should be avoided.</p>
<p>A cruising permit must be obtained in advance: a personal visit must be made to Yangon to pay the fee for a two year permit that can cover three yachts. Alternatively permits can be obtained from yacht agents in Phuket. There are several agents in Phuket that can arrange entry permits. See the list of <a href="Countries/Myanmar%28Burma%29?showAllEntries=1&amp;rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Noonsite/Myanmar/ClearanceAgents</strong></a> below.</p>
<p>A copy of the yacht(s) registration must be given along with a photo each of the front, side and stern view of the yacht. The department handling yachts in Yangon is MTT and the email is <a href="mailto:mtt.mht@mptmail.net.mm">mtt.mht@mptmail.net.mm</a></p>
<p>Before arrival, email a full crew and passenger list to MTT in Yangon and a photocopy faxed to the agent at the port of entry in Kawthaung.</p>
<p><span>Also on arrival, you must produce 1 copy of the crew and passenger list, 2 passport size photos and 2 copies of the passport (the page with the photo is sufficient) plus the entry fees (see below). </span></p>
<p>It is compulsory to take a Burmese guide on board while the vessel is in Burmese waters.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be vaild for 6 months.</p>
<p>All nationals require visas.  The maximum length of stay being 28 days. Visas can be obtained from Myanmar embassies in <strong><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Thailand/?rc=GeneralInfo#DiplomaticMissions">Bangok</a>,</strong> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Malaysia/?rc=GeneralInfo#DiplomaticMissions"><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Singapore/?rc=GeneralInfo#DiplomaticMissions"><strong>Singapore</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Visas are valid from three months from the date of issue.</p>
<p>The<b> new e-visa</b> only permits entry to the country through <span>Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay international airports and also requires the visitor to stay in registered accommodation. It is not possible to use one when arriving by sea or staying on a yacht.</span></p>
<p>It is possible to obtain a Visa on arrival, but only on production of a pre-approval letter, which takes 2 weeks to obtain. Visas on arrival will not allow any crew or passenger to fly to Yangon or Mergui from Kawthaung. These visas are strictly for sailing the islands in the Mergui Archipelago.</p>
<p>Holders of North Korean passports are refused admission.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Visa regulations change frequently.</p>

<div><p>Cholera is a serious risk. Malaria, as well as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases are endemic in most parts of the country.</p>
<p>Medical facilities are inadequate for even routine medical care. There are few trained medical personnel. Avoid intrusive medical treatments, if possible.</p>
<p>Most foreign drugs on sale have been smuggled into the country, and are often counterfeit or adulterated and thus unsafe to use.</p>
<p>Bottled water should always be used.</p></div>
