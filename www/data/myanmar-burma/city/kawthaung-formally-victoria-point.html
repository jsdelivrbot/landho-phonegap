<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the principal port for the Mergui archipelago. Located just across the Pakchan river from Ranong, Thailand's most northerly port on the Andaman Sea. There is a longtail boat pier at the fishing port of Ranong, which connects the two ports. Not the most attractive town being very noisy and dusty but a photographers delight.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Foreign vessels need to have a license to sail the area </span><b>before </b><span>entering Kawthaung, which can be organized from the <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Myanmar%28Burma%29?showAllEntries=1&amp;rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><b>clearance agents</b></a> listed.  Call your local agent at least 1 hour prior to arrival.</span></p>
<p>Vessels should anchor off the navy and ferry Pier on the west shore of the harbour. The clearance agent will need to be picked up at the ferry pier with an Immigration officer to complete the paperwork, which is done without fuss in 10 minutes. Required documents and paperwork is a valid passport valid for 6 month after your cruise. 2 x passport size photographs, 2 passport copies (only the page with the photo on it) and the visa and entry fee in US$ cash, clean crisp bank notes. (Please make sure the bank notes have no marks on it, as there are no banks or exchange places nearby). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>The visa fee itself amounts to US$ 30.- per person. The BEF consists of a number of different fees and depends on the amount of days and the sailing area to be visited, but one has to add around US$ 250 – US$ 300 per person.</p>
