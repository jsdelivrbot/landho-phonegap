<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/f9c97cc5ad2141478ebf511c578ca165/@@images/image/preview"/>This amazing group of over 800 islands lies just off the coast of southern Myanmar. It is one of the few untouched, unlogged areas in Asia. Its people still clinging to their traditional way of life. Due to its spectacular underwater scenery, it is becoming a popular diving destination. There are hundreds of beaches, hidden fresh water springs, mountain tops to be climbed, Moken sea gypsy villages to be visited and mangrove rivers to be explored. One can spend a month in this area without getting bored.</p>
<p>Burma Boating (a charter company in the area) have some useful information and great photos about cruising the area - see <span>their <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.burmaboating.com/mergui-archipelago/">Mergui Archipelago article</a></b>.</span></p></div></div>

<p>It is compulsory to have a guide on board while cruising here. The guide, sometimes called a 'spy', is a totally wrong assumption. They are young guys working for the Ministry of Travel &amp; Tours (MTT) and earn very little money. Sailing on a yacht as guides, they are there to translate for you when you visit sea gypsy villages, trade for fish or have any meetings with local folks, who mostly do not speak a word of English.Also the guides know the area quite well and are more than happy to help with daily chores on board.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The islands themselves are very beautiful, with plenty of bird &amp; wildlife. Although there are practically no cruising boats, there are, at times, many fishing boats.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Sadly, it has been reported that there is a noticeable amount of plastic and other garbage on the beaches. The garbage is washed up at high tide and as these islands are unoccupied, there is no one to clear it away. However, you  will find untouched beaches without a single foot print and no sign of habitation.</p>
<p>For scuba diving, local knowledge of the dive sites is vital for locating the best sites. There are some really stunning places, but they are far apart and a lot of travelling is required to be able to dive them all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
