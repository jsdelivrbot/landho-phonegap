<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying immediately to the west of Cayman Brac, Little Cayman is the least developed of the Cayman Islands. With a resident population of less than 170, most of Little Cayman remains uninhabited.  It is only 10 miles long and a mile wide.</p>
<p>This quiet, restful island offers the best dive sites and some amazingly spectacular bird watching. It is home to colonies of Red Footed Boobys, frigate birds and herons, as well as a large population of Rock Iguanas.</p>
<p>Position 19<span>°</span> 39.25'N, 80<span>°</span> 04.47'W (entrance to Owen Sound)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>In normal trade wind conditions, there is an anchorage on the north west side of the island in about 4m but this can become rolly at night.</p>
<p>There is a safe anchorage at Owens Sound, approached via a marked channel through the reef, taking note of the leading marks. Anchor in 6 - 7ft, in sand, or use a white dive buoy. If anchoring near the entrance, ensure you do not obscure the leading marks. This anchorage offers protection from all wind  directions.</p>
<p>The settlement here, Blossom Village, has a small store, a fuel station, car rental and a nurse. Some basic repairs possible.</p>
<p>Snipe point offers deeper water but is a more remote location.</p>
<p>There are many mooring buoys around the island. All safe to use.</p>
