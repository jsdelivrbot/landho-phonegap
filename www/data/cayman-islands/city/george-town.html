<div class="hello"><div><p>Grand Cayman is the most visited of the Cayman Islands and the best for supplies (but these can be expensive) and services. Good for snorkelling as well as diving.</p>
<p>It is a popular stopover for yachts on passage between <span>Panama and Key West, Florida. </span></p>
<p><span>It is also a popular stop for cruise ships and the prices charged reflect that..</span></p>

<p>Boats are normally directed to one of the orange mooring buoys. Occasionally boats are asked to go directly to the commercial dock near Customs to complete formalities but it is possible to decline to do this if conditions are such that the concrete dock might damage the boat.</p>
<p>Boats must arrive with an outbound clearance from their last port of call.</p>
<p>Immigration will normally come out to the boat in a launch to deliver the necessary paperwork and then guide you to the jetty adjacent to the offices to complete formalities.</p>
<p>Officials are reported to be very polite, helpful and friendly.</p>
<p>Clearing out can be done on shore and all the crew must attend.</p>
<p>Cruisers have reported being fined for failing to fly the "Q" flag upon arrival, dropping an anchor on coral (you must anchor in sandy spots only), or failing to report directly and immediately to George Town (unless advised otherwise by George Town Security).</p>
<p>If there any cruise ships have recently arrived, yachts will need to wait until they have been cleared first.</p>
<p>If there is a strong north westerly wind, then the Authorities may direct you to anchor at Spotts Bay on the southern side of the island (be sure to avoid anchoring in coral!)</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Contact the Port Authority for information on the location of their 10 orange mooring buoys.</p>
<p>There are many moorings around the island and should be used in preference to anchoring if possible. Moorings at dive sites are identified by a white buoy with a blue strip and are available to the public at no charge. Normally they should only be used for an hour or two, but can be used overnight when diving for the day has finished.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/>There is very limited anchoring off George Town and it is generally uncomfortable due to the movement of the many cruise ships and ferries. North Sound is much calmer and quieter and from here it's possible to hire a car and explore the island.</p>
<p><span>Beware of the shallow depth (max. 7ft) in North Sound. </span>Inside North Sound there are several anchorages and marinas. Governor's Creek anchorage, on the west side, is both sheltered and convenient for shops. Max. draft 6ft.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be landed almost anywhere, <strong>execpt</strong> where cruise ship passengers are being landed (due to security concerns).</p>
<p><strong>Marinas</strong><br/> The marina, run by the Cayman Islands Yacht Club, in North Sound, has been extensively re-built and has visitor berthing.</p>
<p>Harbour House Marina and Boatyard is mid way along the South side of North Sound. <span>This is less of a marina and more a yard with tie ups along a channel. </span></p>
<p>Barcadere Marina is the newest facility in the SW corner of North Sound (opened 2010).</p>
<p>The restaurant, Kaibo, in the NE corner has some berthing, although it is rather remote from the town.</p>
