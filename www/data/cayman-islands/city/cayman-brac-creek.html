<div class="hello"><div><p>Cayman Brac is the most scenic island, with its high limestone cliffs. It lies just 5 NM east of Little Cayman and has excellent dive sites.</p>
<p>Creek is the settlement on the NW coast of the island.</p>
<p>Position 19° 44'48"N, 79° 46'05"W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Cayman Brac Customs should be contacted on VHF channel 16 on approach. If no reply try either calling by phone or "Cayman Shipping Adviser" on VHF ch. 16 who can then contact Customs.</p>
<p>Boats may be able to come alongside the Customs dock on the north side of the island (be advised - it is concrete), otherwise, moor to the white mooring buoy about 40m from the dock. (position 19°44.655N, 79°46.214W).</p>
<p>All the officials will require being transported out to the boat and back. The landing place for the pickup may seem at first sight, impossible, but there is a narrow cut which leads to a sheltered pool with a boat ramp.</p>
<p>If there is too much swell, you may be allowed to go to a buoy on the south side of the island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are over 100 mooring buoys around the island - all well maintained. Most villages have a dock where it is possible to land in a dinghy, many of which have a free toilet and shower facility.</p>
<p>Moorings at dive sites are identified by a white buoy with a blue strip and are available to the public at no charge.</p>
