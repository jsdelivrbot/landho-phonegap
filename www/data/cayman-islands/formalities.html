<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. The Cayman Islands are an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>The Cayman Islands have a particularly rich marine life and so strict regulations are in force to protect its beauty. Many indigenous species are protected including sea turtles, iguanas and orchids. In the Marine Parks and Environmental Zones no marine life at all may be taken, although one may fish outside protected areas. There are permanent moorings on the west coast of Grand Cayman which is a popular diving area.</p>
<p>Anchoring: Yachts are to use fixed moorings only. Boats of less than 60 feet may anchor in sand, as long as no grappling hook is used and no coral is touched. Anchoring is permitted in designated anchorage areas and in replenishment zones.</p>
<p>The main restrictions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damaging coral by anchor or chains is prohibited.</li>
<li>No marine life may be taken while scuba diving.</li>
<li>No corals or sponges may be removed.</li>
<li>A spear gun or seine net may not be used without a licence from the Cayman Marine Conservation Board, and then only in certain areas.</li>
<li>The export of live fish and other marine life is prohibited.</li>
<li>Fishing with gill nets or poison is prohibited.</li>
<li>Dumping anything at all in the sea is prohibited. All yachts need a holding tank.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lobster: The closed season is February 1 to July 31. Only spiny lobster may be taken and six-inch tail length is the minimum size. There is a catch limit of five per person or 15 per boat per day, whichever is less.</p>
<p>Conch: There is a catch limit of 15 per person or 20 per boat per day, whichever is less. No one may buy or receive more than 20 conch from Cayman waters per day.</p>
<p>Grouper: Certain areas off the east end of each of the islands are protected for grouper spawning.</p>
<p>Penalties: A maximum fine of $5000 and one year in jail can be applied for contravening the regulations. Confiscation of the boat and other equipment may also be ordered. The protected areas and marine parks are clearly marked while full-time officers enforce the rules and can arrest offenders.</p>
