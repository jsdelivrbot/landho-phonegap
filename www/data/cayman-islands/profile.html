<li>A British Overseas Territory en-route from Jamaica to Cuba or across to the islands of Honduras. </li>
<li>Grand Cayman, lying some 80 miles west of its smaller sisters, has several anchorages and well protected marinas inside a shallow lagoon. Grand Cayman's chief attraction is its underwater world, which can be described as a diver's paradise. The sea surrounding the island is a marine park and conservation area.</li>
<li>Marine supplies and all repair facilities are good in George Town.</li>
<li>Little Cayman and Cayman Brac are less developed and even less visited by cruising yachts than the main island. </li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>

<div><p>The islands are cooled by the prevailing north east trades, so the mean winter temperature is 75°F (24°C) and in the summer 79-84°F (26-29°C). The winter northerlies make most anchorages untenable, when shelter must be sought either off the south coast or inside North Sound. The hurricane season is June to November</p>
