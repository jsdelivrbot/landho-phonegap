<p><span>The annual Grindadráp whaling season in the Faroe Islands takes place between June and September. This event has attracted protesters and there will be an increased security presence during this time. </span></p>
<p>It must be noted that, although a dependency of Denmark, The Faroe Islands are <strong>not</strong> part of the European Union.</p>

<div><p>The Faeroes have a tradition of "prohibition" (i.e. no alcohol) although alcoholic drinks can now be purchased from special state shops (Rúsdrekkasøla Landsins). Since 1992 the licensing laws have been relaxed and there are now licensed restaurants and pubs.</p>
<p>Yachts are allowed small quantities on board for their own use (one bottle of spirits per person, slightly more of wine), but it is frowned upon to take alcohol ashore.</p>

<div><p>Navigation: The Faeroe courtesy flag should be flown, not the Danish. The flag shows a red cross with a small blue border (like the Danish white cross), on a white field.</p>
<p>Overhead cables cross the fjords and sounds between the islands and give a reading on radar similar to a ship.</p>
<p>Tidal streams run very strongly both around and between the islands, being significantly stronger at the equinox, when the tidal race may reach 11 knots in places. At the entrance to the fjords a combination of wind and tide can create a big sea, while inside the fjords if a strong tide is running one can navigate close to the steep-to sides where counter-eddies may be found. Information on dangerous overfalls and races as well as on the direction of the tides can be found in Tidal Current around the Faeroe Islands (Streymkort fyri Foroyar; ed. Fischer Heinesen) which has an English translation of essential information and is available at Jacobsen?s Bokhandil, Husagardur 2, Thorshavn.
