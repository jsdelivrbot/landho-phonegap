<li>The Faeroe Islands (Føroyar in Faeroese) are a small group of islands with a surface area of 540 square miles situated in the North Atlantic between Scotland and Iceland. They are a self-governing dependency of Denmark, although there is a move in the Faeroes towards independence from Denmark, and the latter has made it clear that it is ready to grant the Faeroes independence if that's what the islanders want.</li>
<li>The capital and main port is Thorshavn on the island of Streymoy, which is the largest of the group. The smaller islands are very distinctive with precipitous cliffs and steep hills. Some of the coasts are broken by fjords providing spectacular scenery.</li>
<li>Fuel and water are available in Thorshavn, Tvoroyri and Klaksvik and other fishing ports. There are no special facilities for yachts and any marine supplies available are those for fishing boats. However, basic repairs can be carried out using the extensive repair and shipbuilding facilities provided for the fishing fleets.</li>

The incidence of summer gales is similar to other places on the West European seaboard. Sudden squalls may be experienced inside the fjords. In the summer months the long daylight hours may be enjoyed, the weather is fairly mild due to the Gulf Stream and winds are often light.</p>
