<p>The main fishing harbour for smaller boats, on the west side, is one berthing option if space can be found. The boat harbour in the NE corner is not suitable for yachts. It might be possible to get permission to use one of the heavy fishing boat moorings or there is a good holding in the anchorage off the beach to the west of the small boat harbour.</p>
<p>The Harbour Office is the prominent modern building at the west harbour. Call on VHF channel 16, or 12 (working).</p>
<p>Showers are in the harbour office. Water and diesel on the quay.</p>
<p>Reasonable shops.</p>
<p>Repairs are possible at the shipyard.</p></div></div>
