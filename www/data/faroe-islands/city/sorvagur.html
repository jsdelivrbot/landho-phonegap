<div class="hello"><div><p>This village is approached via a long fjord, boardered by magnificient waterfalls. Beware of unlit fish farms in the fjord.</p>
<p>The best berth is on the semi-derelict quay at the entrance to the small boat harbour, by the salmon processing plant. This is a mile form the main village.</p>
<p>The Harbour Office is at the western end of the processing plant.</p>
<p>There is water on the quay. Reasonable shops and a bank in the village.</p>
<p>The airport is a mile and a half from the village - uphill.</p>
