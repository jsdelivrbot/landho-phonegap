<p>Mobile phones
The GSM system is the most commonly used mobile phone system in the Faroes and can be used throughout the islands. Føroya Tele (Faroese Telecom) and Vodafone have many cooperation agreements with other countries, so-called roaming agreements, so that foreign visitors can make use of their own mobile phones while they are in the Faroes, and Faroese mobile phones can be used in large parts of the world. Føroya Tele and Vodafone also provide prepaid telephone cards. Prepaid telephone cards can be purchased in the Teleshops, kiosks, petrol stations, post offices, hotels and tourist offices. </p>
<p>Internet
Internet cafés can be found in the Tourist Information Offices in Tórshavn, Sandoy and Runavík.</p>
