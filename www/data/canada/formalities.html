<div><p>On arrival at a port of entry, Customs (CBSA) should be contacted on <span>Tel: </span><b>1-888-226-7277</b><span> or </span><span>204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064 who will then advise the skipper on the correct course of action.</span></p>
<p>No person except the skipper may leave the boat until clearance has been granted.</p>
<p>For frequent cross-border boaters, there exists the NEXUS program which is available to low risk, pre-screened Canadian and US citizens and which simplifies the clearance procedures for them. For details of the NEXUS program, see the  <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/marine-maritime-eng.html"><strong>Canada Border Services/NEXUS</strong></a> program website.</p>

<div><p>All nationalities need a valid passport, including US citizens.</p>
<p>Most nationals do not require a visa, but for an updated list of those countries whose citizens do require one, see <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp"><strong>the Canadian Government </strong></a> web site.</p>
<p>The length of stay, up to six months, is decided by the Immigration officer at the port of entry.</p>
<p>Private Canadian and American citizens can apply to be included under the NEXUS program. This scheme is a joint US/Canadian Customs and Immigration program for frequent travellers between the two countries. It replaces the CANPASS permit. NEXUS is designed to simplify procedures for pre-approved, low-risk boaters who regularly cross the border. It allows such boaters to clear Customs and Immigration of either Canada or the U.S.A. by contacting the Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) within 30 minutes and up to 4 hours prior to arrival.</p>

<div><p>All firearms must be declared to Customs on arrival. There are no permit requirements for long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, when imported temporarily for hunting, sporting or competition use while in Canada, or for in-transit movement through Canada, or for personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada.</p>
<p>Generally, restricted firearms, such as pistols or revolvers, may only be imported for gun shows and shooting competitions. If travelling through Canada between mainland USA and Alaska, restricted firearms should be shipped directly by a commercial carrier as a permit to transport is generally not issued in such cases.</p>
<p>Other prohibited items include mace, pepper spray and stun guns.</p>
<p>Many souvenirs made of or containing animal or plant products may be controlled or, in the case of endangered species, prohibited entry into Canada.</p>
<p>Some examples of the types of souvenirs that are not allowed entry into Canada under CITES include: sperm whale teeth, suntan lotion from marine turtles, large spotted cat skins and fur articles, tortoiseshell jewellery, ivory and ivory products, stuffed crocodiles and crocodile leather products, all rhinoceros products, and carapaces from marine turtles.</p>
<p>All alcoholic beverages and tobacco products must be declared on arrival. If you meet the age requirements set by the province or territory where you enter Canada, you can bring in the free allowance.</p>
<p>Non-resident visitors may leave their boats in Canada during the off-season without payment of duties only if repair or maintenance work is to be undertaken by a bona fide marina or service outlet during that time. Before leaving a boat, the owner must advise the local Customs office of the details and produce a copy of the work order, identifying the unit and showing the name and address of the owner, the type of work to be done, and the location where the work will be carried out.</p>
<p>Canada has complex requirements, restrictions and limits that apply to importing meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables and other foodstuffs. Visitors can avoid problems by not bringing such goods into Canada.</p>
