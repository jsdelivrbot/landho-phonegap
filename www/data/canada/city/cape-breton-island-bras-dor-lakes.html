<div class="hello"><div><p>This much indented island lies immediately north east of the main part of Nova Scotia. Access to the popular inland sea cruising area of the Bras d'Or Lakes lies either through a narrow channel 5nm NW of the commercial port of Sydney or from the south via the St Peter's lock.</p>
<p>This attractive island is also known for its celtic heritage.</p>
<p>Location 46° 21'W, 60° 10'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are only one or two marinas in the lakes area but almost unlimited anchorages.</p>
<p>Port Hawkesbury, not on the lake, but on the SW side of the island, has a small marina with limited space for visitors.</p>
<p>If entering the Lakes from the south through St Peter's Canal, then the marina here is a useful stop. Call the lock on VHF channel 10 (NOT 16).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the marina at Dundee is now closed (2012).</p>
<p>Baddeck is another useful port of call. It lies north of the Bas d'Or lake, through the Grand Narrows at Iona.</p>
<p>If entering (or exiting) the Lakes from the north, then the marina at the Barra Straits will prove to be useful.</p>
