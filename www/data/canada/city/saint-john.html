<div class="hello"><div><p>Call Fundy Radio and monitor VHF channel 12 when approaching the harbour. Whatever the visibility, be aware of the heavy shipping movements in the area.</p>
<p>Tie to the floating dock at Market Slip, on the east side at the head of the harbour, just past the Coast Guard wharf. </p>
<p>This berth is only normally used to wait for the tide to pass up the river, or to Clear in as it is convenient for the Customs office. The eddies and tides make for an uncomfortable berth.</p>
<p>Once through Reversing Falls, the Saint John river has almost unlimited anchoring and berthing possiblities. The water is fresh and the tides are small.</p>
