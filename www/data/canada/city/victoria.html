<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Although the harbour is very busy, the entrance is wide and the current only runs at about 2 knots, so entering is straight forward. Beware of the float plane landing strip in the area of the harbour known as Inner Harbour. It is marked by yellow buoys.</span></p>
<p>There are several marinas within the harbour area. James Bay dock has visitors' berths and is right in the heart of the town. It is situated just across the street from the Empress Hotel, which is a significant landmark in Victoria. There are more visitors' berths at the Wharf Street government floats, 4 blocks to the west. Both docks are managed by the Wharf Manager whose office is midway between the two. Stays at these two docks are limited to 3 days in the summer months.</p>
<p>Local weather Tel: 001 250 656 2714/15</p>
<p>There are other visitors' berths, although they are further from the city centre. The principal one is in the marina at West Bay, which is to port when proceeding through the outer part of the main harbour. It is about 1.5 to 2 miles from downtown Victoria, although it is a very pleasant stroll along a boardwalk alongside the water, called the Westsong Walkway. Alternatively, you can catch the harbour ferry which whisks you into downtown in minutes. The approach is via a narrow dredged channel.</p>
