<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a government dock here which has been expanded with the addition of a breakwater. <span>The original dock has 20A power and water, while the new breakwater float does not. Moorage is on first-come basis. There is a toilet and a boat ramp. </span></p>
<p><span>There is also a restaurant and accommodation close by.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several suitable anchorages in the inlet depending on the wind direction.</span></p>
<p>One anchorages is just north of the government dock in 6-10 metres. Good holding in sand and mud, with shore access via the public wharf.</p>
<p>About 2nm north of the dock is <span>Penrose Bay. It is exposed to southerly winds, but has plenty of swinging room just south of boats on private moorings. Anchor in <span>in 10-14 metres.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the head of the inlet is </span></span><span>Freke Anchorage. This has reasonable protection from the south and good holding in 12-14 metres over firm mud and sand. </span></p>
