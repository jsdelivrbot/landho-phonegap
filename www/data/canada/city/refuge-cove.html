<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a public wharf here and two good anchorages. One anchorage is west of the public wharf in about 10-12m. The other, which is very sheltered, but shallower, is at the head on the cove in 2 to 6m over mud. Beware of the rocks at the entrance to this little bay.</p>
<p>There is a refuge barge based here during the high season.</p>
