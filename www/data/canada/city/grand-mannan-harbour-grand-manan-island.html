<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor to Fishermans Wharf in Flagg Cove. This is primarily for the fishing boats but transient boaters are also welcomed and <span>every effort is made to find safe, comfortable berthing whenever possible.</span> Some electricity is available. No pump-out.</p>
<p>The most convenient place to lie is inside the recently-dredged westerly part where there is more room and better access to a float for landing. The inner corner is reserved for large herring seiners.</p>
<p>Along the western portion of the wharf, you can probably find a boat about your size to tie alongside. Boats here usually moor heading westward. If there are fishermen around, they will help with your lines.</p>
<p>There is a CAN$30/day (plus tax) fee for dockage here, even when you are rafted to the fishing boats, and the harbormaster will come by to collect it. He might also shepherd you into his pickup and give you a lift if you need one!</p>
