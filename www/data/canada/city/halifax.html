<p><span>There are five major yacht clubs in town. The Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron is particularly welcoming to visiting yachts and has good facilities.</span></p>
<p>For those looking for a more sheltered location, consider going further into the Northwest Arm and either picking up a mooring or finding dockage at the Armdale YC, the Shearwater YC or anchoring out. This end of the Northwest Arm is much closer to town than the RNSYS and there are several large grocery stores within walking distance, as well as a bus service into town.</p>
