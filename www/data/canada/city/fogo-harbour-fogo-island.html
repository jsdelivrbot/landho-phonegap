<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour is located on the north west coast of Fogo Island, the largest of the many islands off the north east coast of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>It was originally settled as a fishing port serving the rich source of cod off the Newfoundland coast. With the decline in fish stocks and closure of the fishing grounds, the town now depends on crab and lobster.</p>
<p>Position 49° 43'48"N, 54° 15'42"W (eastern entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There are two entrances to Fogo Harbour and neither is safe in bad weather or if there is a heavy swell from the north. <span>The eastern entrance is easier and safer and is buoyed. It is not safe to enter at night.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There is a safe, alongside berth inside the outer arm of the government dock. This gives good protection in all winds but is adjacent to the fish processing plant with its associated smells.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>Anchorage</i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i></i><span>The recommended anchorage off Wigwam Point has a great deal of kelp over a bottom of gravel and sandy mud. Once through the kelp the holding is only fair and because of the kelp.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span><span> Water can be had by jerry can from the unloading dock. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There is no diesel available in the town</span> .</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There is a small supermarket with a liquor store attached, a clothing store, coffee shop with WiFi, post office and basic hardware store, but no laundry.</span></span></span></p>
