<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruisers report it is convenient to tie up to one of the floats by the front leading mark (47° 34'00"N, 52° 42'07"W),  near the large "Canada" building known as "Queens Wharf". There are no facilities, water or electricity, but the dock is very handy for downtown.</p>
<p>An alternative berth can be found further into the harbour at <span> Piers 6-9. This is more convenient for downtown, but is noisier and berthing is among the day tripper boats. There is water here and sometimes electricity.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Dockage here is inexpensive and payment is made at the Harbour Master's office in the blue building north on Water St.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Anchoring is prohibited in the harbour. </span></p>
<p>Showers can be found at the YMCA on Kingsbridge Road, a 15 minute walk from the floats.</p>
