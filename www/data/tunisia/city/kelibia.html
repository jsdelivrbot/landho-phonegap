<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Police and Customs are pleasant and accommodating. They will come to your boat for an inspection and may ask for “souvenirs/cadeaux” (whisky and/or cigarettes) and will complete all documentation while on your boat, taking your passports to their office and returning them a short while later. If you have prepared a list of all electronics on board, including computers, tablets, cell phones, navigation equipment, radio’s TV’s etc., it will speed up the process.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Entrance is straight forward and the port offers good shelter in almost all conditions although space is tight as this is a working fishing port.</span></p>
<p>There is only a small section of dock for visitors and most of the space is taken up by local boats or seemingly abandoned ones. No water or electricity. The north side of this pontoon is reserved for Guarde National and even though you might be encouraged to tie up there, do not. When the Guarde National boat returns (at any hour) you will have to move.</p>
<p>Be prepared for rafting up next to other boats and have plenty of fenders ready. The dockmasters do try hard to find a place for you to berth, and usually they try to assist with docking, including moving other boats to make room.</p>
<p>Alternatively it might be possible to dock along the south breakwater/quay just east of the fuel station. Be mindful that the wall is rough and can do damage to your boat, not the best place in strong northerlies.</p>
<p>There is big travel lift, which might be available for emergency repairs. Because of the many fishing boats some common parts might be available or can be made.</p>
<p>This is not a “marina” by any stretch of the imagination, however is reported to be a clean port with friendly officials and of course, is cheap. Hammamet and Monastir both have marinas, and if attainable may be better choices if you are planning to stay for longer periods of time. Costs however are much higher.</p>
