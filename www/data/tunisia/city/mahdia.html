<p>This is a Port of Entry and there is a Customs post here. Note however that Customs are not based at the port, they have a large building within the town limits.</p>
<p><span>It is likely you will be asked to moor alongside the police dock - <span>the port-hand pier in the inner harbour</span>. </span></p>
<p><span>They will alert Customs of your arrival who will</span><span> come and visit the boat.</span></p>
<p><span> Officials reported to be polite and efficient.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Extensive work on the construction of the new Marina Mahdia has been on-going here since 2013, with no end in sight. It is being built in a lagoon just outside the town and will be an impressive facility if/when finished.</span></p>
<p>Currently the only berthing option here is alongside the police dock.</p>
