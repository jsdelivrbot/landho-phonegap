<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on the Northern coast of Tunisia, Bizerte is its oldest city, but sadly rather run down and in need of some cosmetic work. It is defended from the sea by a double kasbah (fort) that is in perfect shape despite it being 400 years old (the original structure dates back to Byzantine times).</p>
<p>If on a Med passage Westwards and facing SW-NW winds having rounded Cape Bon, this port is a welcome haven which offers good shelter now that the marina has re-opened.</p>
<p>Bizerte is 45 minutes by fast motorway from Tunis airport.</p>
<p>Position: <span>37°16'31"N,  09°53'38"’E (harbour entrance)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As a port of entry, there are Customs and Immigration offices on the main marina quay. Customs and Immigration officials however usually visit the yacht and are reported to be friendly and helpful. Sometimes they ask for a "gift" (ie. money), which can increase the cost of an overnight stay dramatically and cruisers recommend employing an agent (100 Euros approx.) to avoid these problems.</p>
<p>Immigration charges are approx. 30 Euros a person.</p>
<p>If stopping here just for fuel, bear in mind that the fuel station only takes local currency and that clearance is still required. This makes it an expensive fuel stop.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Marina</strong></p>
<p><span>The marina here was badly damaged in a storm in February 2006. Since then, a major redevelopment of the marina and surrounding area has been in the planning, expanding the size of the marina and services on offer. The marina is now open, with the official opening ceremony at the end of May 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>Yachts must notify the marina prior to arrival. <span>The entrance to the marina is marked with red and green lights at night – the green light on the head of N breakwater while the red light is on the head of Jetty 4. Keep clear of Jetty 4 (outer side) due to shallow waters (marked with orange buoys).</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></p>
<p>Anchoring off the marina here is not advisable in an onshore wind, as the long fetch between the breakwater and shore can create a large, dangerous swell.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing Harbour</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can also berth in the old fishing harbour outside the main entrance on the port hand side (alongside a fishing boat most likely). This is very sheltered. Fuel and water are available here through a local agent (who can also arrange Customs and Immigration - fee Euro 100). <span>It is possible to walk from here to the old town, albeit through some rather "unsavoury" neighbourhoods. Not an ideal place to re-provision.</span></p>
<p>The Port Captain should be asked for advice on spare parts etc.</p>

      The marina is located in the outer harbour and has been completely re-developed. It is now a five star fully-serviced facility, part of a villa, shopping and entertainment complex. Berths are spread over 2 basins, depending on the size of yacht, however all sizes can be accommodated up to 110m. Med mooring with lazy lines. <br>
All facilities, tax &amp; duty-free fuel, pumpout facility, WiFi, yacht club, security. Exclusive superyacht quay.<br>
A fully serviced shipyard is being developed half a mile from the marina with a 50 &amp; 400 ton hoist, suitable for catamarans as well.
