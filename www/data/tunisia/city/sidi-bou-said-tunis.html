<div class="hello"><div><p>Sidi Bou Said lies about 5nm north east of the entrance to the commercial port of Tunis. It is a convenient base from which to explore the ruins at Carthage and the capital Tunis. The old town is worth the climb up from the marina, but keep to the main streets to see the best of it.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Mooring</strong><br/> The marina is usually full from November to June and even in summer advance reservations are necessary. Details of the boat and ETA etc. (in French) are required <strong>by fax</strong> in advance of arrival.</p>
<p>Boats over 20 m LOA must contact the marina at least one week before arrival.</p>
<p>Facilities at the marina are very poor, no security (open to the public) and the water filthy.</p>
<p>The weather forecast is only available if you pay a <code>gift</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> If you must visit this port, then anchoring off the marina (where it is free), is a better option. Here the water is clean and the sand offers good holding. Somewhere around 3651.5N/01021E would be good.</p>

      This marina has 360 berths, but often there is not much room. This is due to the space taken up by large boats which cannont leave until the entrance has been dredged (it is prone to silting). There is water and electricity. Nominally a shower and toilets(very poor), fuel quay. 20-ton travelift. Very limited repair facilities.<br>
Reported as having very unhelpful staff who demand 'gifts'.<br>
It is very expensive (79 euro/night for 14.5m in 2010) with no discount for longer stays.<br>
Close by there are hotels, shops and restaurants.
