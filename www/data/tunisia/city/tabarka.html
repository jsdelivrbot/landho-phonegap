<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is on the north coast, close to the Algerian border and is usually the first landfall for yachts coming from the north. It is classified as a C yachting harbour, and borders the Montazah/Tabarka resort area. It is a useful stop if wishing to visit the underground Roman Villas at Bulla Regia, about 30 miles south of the port.</p>
