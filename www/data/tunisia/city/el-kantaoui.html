<div class="hello"><div><p>Access to the marina is via a canal.</p>
<p>The arrival quay is to port of the entrance and the Port Captain's office is in the white building on that quay. Customs and immigration are on the opposite side, by the travel lift.</p>
<p>Docking fees for longer stays are quite reasonable but advance bookings are essential for winter stays (2 or 3 months in advance and advance payment of 50% required). The marina is full in winter.</p>
<p>A pleasant marina with a limited range of repair service. In onshore winds a swell makes itself felt inside the marina especially on the western quay (reception dock) by the Capitainerie.</p>
<p>Pharmacy, banks and supermarkets all close by.</p>
