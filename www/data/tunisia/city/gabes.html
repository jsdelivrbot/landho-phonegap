<div class="hello"><div><p>Gabes is a mixture of old and new, its main appeal being the historic old quarters of Jara, Boulbala and especially Mensel where there are maze-like alleys, mosques and lively markets.</p>
<p>This town is where the Sahara desert begins. The architecture and landscape change and there are not as many historical sites as further north, but, there are many places of interest.</p>
