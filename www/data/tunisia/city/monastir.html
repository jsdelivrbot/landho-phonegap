<div class="hello"><div><p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Monastir is one of the principal towns in the eastern part of Tunisia, and is 160 Km from the capital, Tunis.</span></p>
<p>The "monastery" after which the town was named, was built by an Islamic religious order in 797 to defend the town from roaming nomadic tribes and Byzantine warships. The fortress houses a lovely museum of Islamic art and artefacts.</p>
<p><span>Monastir is 187 nm from Malta and Malta is 54 nm from Ragusa, Sicily. It is a useful place to visit if you need to reset your Schengen or VAT clock.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a good marina and boatyard here, however space on the hard is limited so advance booking is recomended. Prices are moderate and quality reported to be good. See comments at bottom of page. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Customs and Immigration officials are resident at the marina, just a few doors down from the marina office.  Check-in is reported to be straightforward however cruisers do warn of the <span>"baksheesh" culture (see comments at bottom of page).</span></p>
<p>The offices are in the white building on the starboard side past the yard and reception dock.</p>

Good and secure for wintering. Almost full in winter but spaces available in summer. Contact in May to book space for the winter. Laying up afloat a better option as limited storage space ashore, but make sure someone is looking after the boat as inexperienced marina staff are likely to move un-occupied boats. <br>
