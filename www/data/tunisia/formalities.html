            </h2>
<div><p>On arrival at a port of entry, report to the Harbour Master and all persons must remain on board until the formalities are completed. Formalities on arrival are usually simplified by the fact that the various officials will visit the boat, or are often waiting on the quay, on arrival.</p>
<p>Customs require a list of dutiable goods and often wish to see the yacht's insurance papers. They will issue a cruising permit (valid for 6 months). Then clear with Immigration and the Harbour Master (marine marchande) to whom harbour dues have to be paid. In subsequent ports officials may retain the permit during one's visit and will request crew lists.</p>
<p>When leaving each port, pay the harbour fees and check out with the port police, who will want to know the yacht's next destination.</p>
<p>On departure from Tunisia, the permit must be surrendered to Customs and Immigration must also be visited.</p>
<p>Anchoring between ports is discouraged.</p>

<div><p>A cruising permit (triptique) is issued on arrival when clearing in, free of charge. The period of validity will be stated on the permit and is usually three months (six months in Monastir). It is renewable up to one year. If leaving the yacht in Tunisia, but departing the country by other means, the permit must be returned and customs will put the yacht in containment, during which time one cannot cruise, although crew can remain on board. When wishing to cruise again, one must obtain a new permit. If a yacht is left in Tunisia in the care of a marina or boatyard while the owner is abroad, the validity of the permit can be extended.</p>
<p>Unattended boats may remain in Tunisia for any length of time provided Customs is informed.</p></div>
