<div><ul>
<li><span><strong><span>July 2016: The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises <span> against all but essential travel to Tunisia.</span> T<span><span>he Tunisian Government's ‘State of Emergency’ is still in place.</span></span></span></strong></span></li>
<li>Of all the North African countries, Tunisia has approached yachting in the most systematic way. Realising the considerable revenue that can be generated by cruising yachts, the Tunisian government has encouraged the setting up of a chain of marinas and yacht harbours conveniently spaced along Tunisia's entire coast, from Zarzis in the south-east to Tabarka in the west.</li>
<li>All ports are within reach of colourful towns and the boat can be left in safety to visit the interior. All this, plus the relatively low prices of the marinas, has turned Tunisia into a popular cruising destination, especially for wintering. For those wishing to get a taste of Africa, without actually leaving the Mediterranean, Tunisia is undoubtedly the best choice.</li>
<li>Yachting facilities are the best in North Africa and as good as in many other parts of the Mediterranean. There are marinas at Sidi Bou Said (Tunis), Hammamet, Port Kantaoui and Monastir, and one due for completion in Bizerte. Facilities in fishing ports are often basic.</li>
<li>There are haul-out facilities at Sidi Bou Said (Tunis), Kantaoui, Hammamet, Monastir, Bizerte, Kelibia and Sfax.</li>
<li>Marine supplies are not widely available although there are chandleries attached to some marinas. Provisioning is good everywhere.</li>
<li>Because of its good facilities, security and attractive prices, Tunisia has become a popular wintering place, especially with owners of boats who wish to avoid spending too long in the EU. Three marinas are most suitable for wintering: Yasmine Hammamet, El Kantaoui and Monastir. They have similar amenities and long term fees are negotiable. Sidi Bou Said is usually full and is much more expensive than the other marinas. Equipment or spares from abroad should be addressed to the marina, which will assist in clearing it through customs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If cruising the waters bordered by southern Sicily, Malta, Tunisia and Libya, be aware that because of an influx of migrants attempting to leave from Northern Africa there is an increase in Navy patrols in this area and the danger of small unlit craft carrying passengers. </li>

<div><p><span>A terrorist attack took place at Port El Kantaoui near Sousse on 26 June 2015. A number of foreign tourists were killed. <span>Further terrorist attacks in Tunisia, including in tourist resorts, are possible.</span></span></p>
<p>Check the current security situation using a website such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia"><strong>UK FCO</strong></a>. They advise that th<span>ere is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping and currently advise against all but essential travel to the country.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, Tunisians are polite and helpful to all and since tourism is one of the biggest industries, they have grown accustomed to foreigners of all nationalities.</span></p>

<div><p>Inland the climate can be very hot in summer, but the winters are mild. Spring and autumn are the best times. Westerly winds prevail along the north coast, but in summer they are usually interrupted by the daily alternating land and sea breezes. Along the east coast the prevailing winds of summer are SE. The occasional sirocco arrives with gale force winds from the south, but is usually short lived.</p>
