<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/>Anyone cruising using Digicel should be aware that if you purchase a SIM card in one country, it cannot be topped up in different one, as previously possible. So if you wish to use the sim bought here while cruising in other countries, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or set up an account and do it online.<br/>You can top-up Digicel at <a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p></div>

<div><p>AIRPORT The main international airport is located less than an hour away from Bahia del Sol by car. A taxi will cost you approximately $30 each way. TACA is the name of the El Salvadorian airline. Continental, as well as other airlines, fly out of El Salvador. It is recommended that you contact a travel agent to make plans or else go to the airport personally to arrange your travel plans. You can get to the airport by bus, but it involves taking at least 3 different buses. Take a bus to Arco, go up the path, cross the highway, and take a bus toward San Salvador. Tell the driver’s assistant who takes your money that you want to go to the airport. They will tell you when to get off. Cross the highway and catch another bus going toward the airport. Remember—When you leave the country you will pay an exit tax of about $28,cash. There is an ATM at the airport.</p>
<p>If you plan to take a rental car out of the country, say to Guatemala, you must inform the rental company in order to obtain a necessary official form that specifies the days you will be in the other country, and this form is obtained for an additional fee (amount varies with each rental agency).</p></div>
