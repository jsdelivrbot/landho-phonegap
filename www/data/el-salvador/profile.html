            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>El Salvador lies on the west coast of central America, bordering the Pacific Ocean. It is surrounded by Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.</li>
<li>Cruising boats are welcome to stop in El Salvador. There are 3 ports where recreational boats can visit: Bahia del Sol; Barillas; and Gulf of Fonseca, however the first 2 are the best options. La Union, located in the Gulf of Fonseca, is an industrial port and has little to offer cruising boats. </li>
<li>Boats travelling in the Gulf of Fonseca are likely to be intercepted, and possibly boarded, by Navy patrol boats who check for proper zarpes. Be aware that 3 different countries border the Gulf. </li>
<li>Cruising boats are discouraged by the port officials to arrive in Acajulta because it is a shipping port. Both Bahia del Sol and Barillias have convenient access to major supplies if you can spend a few days to travel to nearby large cities where you can find almost everything you need.</li>

            </h2>
<div><p>Currently the only security issue for cruisers in El Salvador, like in all places, is dinghy theft.  It is recommend that motors are locked to the dinghy and the dinghy lifted out of the water at night. If the dinghy has to stay in the water, lock it to the boat with a substantial chain.</p>
