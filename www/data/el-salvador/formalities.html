<div><p>Contact should be maintained with the Salvadorean Navy on Channel 16, who will advise on the correct procedure.</p>
<p>Request an international zarpe before departing El Salvador for your next country of visit. If you plan to cruise within El Salvadoran waters, request a national zarpe.</p>
<p>Fees for Clearance into El Salvador were changed in March 2010 but then not enforced due to opposition by the tourist industry (see news report<strong> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Members/sue/R2010-06-23-1">here</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Visiting yachts now pay a minimal charge of $30 for the first 30 days and $30 for each subsequient 30 day period.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/ElSalvador/?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a> below, for further details.</p>
<p>All visiting "tourist boats" are given a 60 day vessel permit by Customs on arrival (temporary import), as long as the skipper/owner has a valid immigration visa. See Customs below for more details.</p>

<div><p>The Customs Office will grant a 60 day permit for tourist boats, regardless of the 90 day permits that Immigration and the Maritime Port Authority grant. If you wish to stay longer than 60 days, you should inform Customs on arrival and they may give you an extension up to 90 days. This is however not automatic.</p>
<p>Permits can however be extended (renewed) once the immigration visa has been extended. This is done by leaving the country and flying  back in (note, it is important you leave all of the 4 countries of CA-4). For further renewal details see report <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Members/sue/R2010-08-22-1"><strong>Renewal of 90 Day Visa</strong></a> ).</p>
<p>The following phone number belongs to the Customer Service Desk in the Customs Office, where you can make an appointment and let them know that you are coming to renew your permit. They speak English and are happy to answer questions. The phone number is: (503) 2244 5041. Be sure to contact them before the 60 days have expired.</p>
<p>It is recommended to check in advance about customs duty for foreign flagged boats, and do not assume anything when dealing with El Salvador officials. The laws change frequently in Latin America.</p>
<p>An authorisation for firearms must be obtained from the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>Fruit is inspected and may be destroyed. Leather products may be subject to disinfection.</p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. El Salvador is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
