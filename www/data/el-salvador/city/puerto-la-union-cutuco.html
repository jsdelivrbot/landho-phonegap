<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The town surrounding the port is also called La Unión, all within the Gulf of Fonseca waters.</span></p>
<p>Few yachts visit La Union, as it and nearby Meanguera are reportedly quite dangerous places. Theft is common in La Union, even under the nose of the navy, and we have received reports of boats at anchor having deck gear stolen at night.</p>
<p>The situation has improved recently and it is now regarded as safe to walk around during the day. The development of a new, but small, marina facility 14nm south of La Union has also improved berthing options here.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The port lies 2 miles from the town of La Union.</p>
<p><span>The Autoridad Maritima Portuaria handle all the clearance procedures for yachts. The</span><span> AMP representative in La Union city must be contacted by phone to receive an arriving vessel in La Unión. See details below.</span></p>
<p>Anchor near the navy dock and the port captain will come out on a small boat. The officers are reported to be very professional and friendly. They will advise you to only come ashore through their base for safety.</p>
<p>A departure certificate (zarpe) will be issued by the port captain and this must be shown at subsequent ports.</p>
