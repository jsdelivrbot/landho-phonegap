<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can anchor in the inner harbour and then the captain must go ashore to clear with Immigration and Port Captain.</p>
<p>The Immigration office is located at the entrance to the dock. The officials here are friendly and used to dealing with yachts.</p>
<p>The Port Captain’s office is located in the town of Acajutla, 1.2 miles to the west. A taxi is likely to cost about $2 and a red mini-motos a quarter of that.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor in the inner harbour in about 7m. There is good shelter here.</p>
<p>There is no safe place ashore to land a dinghy. The only place to tie up to in order to get ashore, is on cement stairs on the west side of the outer commercial dock.</p>
