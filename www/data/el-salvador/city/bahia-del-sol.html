<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a sandbar at the entrance which can be dangerous and can only be navigated at high tide. Entry should not be attempted without a pilot, hail the Bahia Del Sol Hotel on VHF Ch.16 to organise one. Try to time your arrival one or two hours before high tide.</p>
<p>If entry is not possible, you can anchor in 45-50 feet seaward of the entrance. Holding is good in sand, however it can be somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can find shelter in Barillias (32 miles) or the Gulf of Fonseca (60 miles).</p>
<p><span>The hotel here has a small marina. Call the marina on VHF Ch.16 (Call “BAHIA DEL SOL”) for tidal information and a swell report and to arrange a pilot boat. The radio is usually only manned between 0800 and 1800. It is best to e-mail the hotel in advance of your arrival to ensure availability of the pilot (gerente@bahiadelsolelsalvador.com).</span></p>
<p>This is an ideal port to safely leave your boat for an extended period of time. There are 2 mooring fields available with plenty of moorings. They each offer similar services.</p>
<p>There are good anchorages in the Bahia in 4 to 7m in sand/mud.</p>
<p>For boats at anchor or on moorings, the hotel offers a weekly charge for use of all its facilities. <span>For US$14 a week cruisers can use the hotel swimming pool, dinghy dock, WiFi and get 30 % off all restaurant and bar bills. Personnel are reported to be very friendly.</span></p>
