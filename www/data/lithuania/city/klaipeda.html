<div class="hello"><div><p>The Sea Canal, which links the port with the Baltic, is well marked. Yachts are directed to the Customs pier (berth 42) in the commercial harbour, where Customs and Immigration formalities are completed. See <strong><a href="Countries/Lithuania/?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Lithuania Clearance</a> </strong><strong>for full details.</strong></p>
<p>Afterwards yachts are allowed to move to the yacht club, which is located further along the channel on the opposite bank from the town.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach channel constantly moves, so it is advisable to call the Yacht Club or marina in advance. Care should be taken to keep to the marked channel to avoid the mud banks and unmarked fishing nets. Yachts with a draught of up to 2 metres are usually o.k.</p>
<p>Klaipeda Yacht Club has good docking and repair facilities. A club launch makes occasional trips to Klaipeda itself, which is situated on the opposite bank of the river. There is also a ferry crossing. There are good train connections to the capital Vilnius.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts may also find a berth at the Castle Yacht Harbour (Klaipedos Pilies Uostas), on the Dane Canal (Danes Upe), just south of the Immigration office. The harbour is reached via an opening bridge and is more convenient for visiting the town. See this <a href="http://www.yacht.lt/assets/krantines.pdf"><strong>useful map</strong></a> of the yacht harbour.</p>
