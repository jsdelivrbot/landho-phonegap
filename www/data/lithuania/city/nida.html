<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is Lithuania's southernmost port. It is situated on the eastern coast of the Curonian Spit, a sandy spit separating the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea, and it is one of the most beautiful and extraordinary sights in Lithuania. Nida is an old, attractive fishing village, whose, old houses, decorated in typical Lithuanian folk fashion, have survived. It is surrounded by huge sand dunes, on the tallest of which is a lighthouse.</span></p>
