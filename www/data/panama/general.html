<p><span>Local gas (Tropigas &amp; Panagas) is a variable mixture of propane and butane, but works well for most purposes. Be advised that each has its own unique regulator and neither is compatible with US (or other country's) tanks. You CAN get US style tanks filled, but you will need to ask around and it will be alot more expensive (approx. $30 as opposed to $6.40 for local 30# tank). Some cruisers have successfully transferred gas from local tanks to US style tanks with a pigtail-type connection.</span></p></div>

<p><strong>Cell Phones</strong><br/> Both Cable &amp; Wireless Panama and Telefonica Moviles Panama, S.A. (Movistar) use GSM 850 cell phone frequencies. Use a GSM phone with GSM 850 - either pay roaming charges on your current cell phone service provider or buy a prepaid SIM card in Panama assuming your cell phone is not locked to a specific network</p>
<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/><span>Anyone cruising using Digicel should be aware that if you purchase a SIM card in one country, it cannot be topped up in different one, as previously possible. So if you wish to use the sim bought here while cruising in other countries, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or set up an account and do it online.</span><br/><span>You can top-up Digicel at </span><a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p>
<p>Another option is to rent a GSM phone from a local company while you are in Panama</p></div>

<div><p><strong>Airports</strong><br/> <i>Panama City – Aeropuerto Internacional de Tocumen (PTY)</i> <br/>(238-2700) <br/>Located in the eastern part of the city. You will get there faster if you take Corridur Sur expressway. The tolls add up but it is extremely fast. Make sure you are clear with the taxi driver on the fee (are tolls included?) and which way you are going.<br/> <i></i></p>
<p><i>Aeropuerto Marcos A. Gelabert (PAC)</i> <br/>Also known as Albrook airport, is located in the western part of the city, known as Albrook. There are daily flights to all parts of Panama, including the San Blas, David, Bocas, Conatadora and other locations.</p>
<p><i><strong>Note: </strong><span>AIR PANAMA has cancelled flight destination to Corazon de Jesus and El Porvenir (Nov. 2015). These destinations will be reviewed in 2016.</span></i></p>
<p><span></span>These airlines also have a great economical courier service to remote areas of the country. If you have extra suitcases you can air ship them cheaper than checking them with your flight. Just go to the domestic shipping end of the Albrook airport and ship your heavy stuff. The trip between airports by taxi will take at least 45 minutes or longer depending on traffic (allow 1 ½ hours).</p>
<p><i>From Cruisers Network Online - If flying from Panama to Quito, be sure to go armed with copies of your Panama cruising permit and boat documentation, as you will not be allowed to return to Panama without it.</i></p>
<p><strong>Buses</strong><br/> Panama City - The Gran Terminal de Transportes is located adjacent to the Albrook Mall. Bus travel is very economical with numerous and frequent bus service between cities. Within Panama City taxis are better and very economical. Find out the rate before you hire a taxi as like everywhere there are sometimes higher prices for tourists.</p>
<p><strong>Car Rental</strong><br/> Cruisers rent cars in Colon, Panama City and David. Rental cars can not be taken across the border into Costa Rica. The new 4 lane interstate is open between Colon (Sabinitas) and Panama City. In general the roads throughout Panama are good. You can get a better rate if you reserve a car online. You can also rent a GPS with digitized road maps.<br/> <i>Colon</i> – Hertz (442-3272) and Budget (441-2126) are located at Colon 2000.<br/> <i>Panama City</i> – Budget (Tocumen Airport PTY - 263-8777), Hertz (PTY - 301-2611), Dollar (270-0355), Thrifty (204-9555), National (PTY – 265-2222), Avis (PTY – 278-9444), Barriga Rent A Car (PTY – 269-0056), Arrendadora Economica (Nuevo Reparto El Carmen &amp; Calle 50 – (229-5257), and Continental Rent a Car (213-0177).</p>
<p><strong>Train</strong><br/> <i>The Panama Canal Railway</i> (317-6070) <a href="http://www.panarail.com">www.panarail.com</a><br/> Runs one roundtrip per day between Panama City and Colon. From Panama City the train leaves at 7:15 AM from the station which is located in the Albrook area. The train leaves Colon at 5:15 PM. The train ride is about one hour, in modern coaches, air-conditioning and modeled after the railway first built in 1855. To be recommended.</p>
<p><b>Getting to the San Blas from Panama City</b><br/><span>This is easily done by taxi/car. There are lots of companies that do 4wd trips to Carti and they usually can also arrange a small boat from there to take you out to the Islands. </span></p></div>
