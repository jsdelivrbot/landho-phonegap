<div><p><strong>Formalities with the Panamanian Authorities (clearing in and out, immigration etc.) are completely separate from formalities with the Panama Canal Authority for <a href="Members/sue/R2012-03-14-3/">Canal Transit</a>.</strong></p>
<p><i>Noonsite always states the official laws and regulations for clearance formalities. However, in practice many port authorities in Panama operate differently from each other and cruisers may well find they obtain different clearance conditions to those stated. See the adjacent reports and news for the latest info. from cruisers.</i></p>
<p><strong>PANAMA ARRIVAL FORMALITIES</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Important: Be sure to check-in with all authorities as soon as you land in Panama. Cruisers have reported fines of US$1000 each for not having an arrival stamp in their passports.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Advance Notification to the Panamanian </span><span>Maritime Authority</span></strong></p>
<p>There is a law concerning the pre-registration of visiting vessels. This requires details about the yacht and its crew to be sent to the Authorities (AMP) <strong>at least 48 hours</strong> before arrival at any Panamanian port. This information may be sent by email or by filling in the on-line form. <span>The on-line form is available at </span><a href="http://www.amp.gob.pa/atraque/CaptaCartaAtraqueYates.aspx"><strong>AMP website</strong></a></p>
<p>However, the AMP understand that this may not be possible for all yachts, and in such cases, the information will need to be provided on arrival.</p>
<p><strong><i>In practice many authorities are not aware of the advance notification mandate and therefore it is not enforced in all ports. There does not appear to be problems for any boats that have not done so. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Yachts arriving from the Caribbean/South America</strong> <br/>Can no longer clear Immigration at the Panama Canal Yacht Club as it has now been demolished, but must visit the office in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Cristobal%28Colon%29">Colon</a></strong> (or at Shelter Bay Marina). <span>Be sure to arrive with the proper port clearance paper (zarpe). If you arrive without the correct papers you will be fined.</span></p>
<p><strong>Yachts clearing in first at the San Blas Islands</strong> <br/>Clearing into Panama in the San Blas Islands is currently in a state of flux. There is an on-going disagreement between the Kuna Congress and the Central Government, who in turn have suspended the Port Captain and Immigration services in the San Blas pending further developments.</p>
<p><strong>The Immigration and Port Captain offices in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Porvenir">Porvenir</a> </strong>(now called Gaigirgordub) - at the western end of the San Blas - and Puerto Obaldia at the far eastern end, are both closed until further notice.</strong></p>
<p>Vessels entering or leaving Panama on the Caribbean side will need to do so in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Panamamarina">Puerto Lindo</a></strong> (where the Porvenir Port Captain has relocated to) <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Cristobal%28Colon%29">Colon</a></strong> or <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Portobelo">Portobelo</a></strong>. <span>Note that if you check in at Portobelo you will need to go to Colon to buy your Cruising Permit - and - if you check in at Puerto Lindo you will need to go to Portobelo to get your visa from Immigration (short bus ride).</span></p>
<p>If arriving in the San Blas first, it is not advisable to take the SUV's from Carti in the San Blas Islands to Panama City or to Colon to clear in, as you will pass through police check points who will give you a hefty fine (or even arrest you) if you have not already visited an immigration office and had your passport stamped.</p>
<p><span>It is recommended to have the San Blas listed on your exit zarpe from your previous port (e.g. Colon via San Blas). </span></p>
<p><strong>Yachts arriving from the Pacific</strong> <br/>Should be aware that the Immigration offices at the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Balboa">Balboa</a></strong> Yacht Club and Flamenco Island are also classed as "Branch Offices". Officially that means they are not always manned and they can only administer entry to the country stamps, which are valid for 72 hours only.</p>
<p><strong>Yachts going to Panama simply to transit the Panama Canal<br/></strong><span>Regulations are somewhat "cloudy" with reference to the </span><span>72 hour rule mainly being applied to commercial vessels transiting the Panama </span><span>Canal, which most do within 72 hours, and for which no navigation </span><span>permit is required and no crew visa. For yachts however it is a different story and a cruising permit and visa is required. <span>According to regulations a domestic Zarpe is </span><span>also required by yachts transiting the Canal (either Colon-Balboa or Balboa-</span><span>Colon).</span></span></p>
<p><i><span></span><strong>Note:</strong> Some yachts using <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">agents</a></strong> have been able to pass the Canal handled the same way as commercial vessels, however this is only possible if the yacht in question has transited previously and registered with the Canal and is ready to transit on arrival in Panama.</i></p>
<p><strong>The process for clearance is:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Present your passport at the closest Immigration office to obtain a 72 hour visa. <span>You will also need to provide copies of your </span><span>International Zarpe, crew list and passports.</span></p>
<p>(2) Go to the Port Captain's Office to obtain your "Declaration General" and <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>"</strong><strong>Permiso de Navegacion"</strong></a> (Cruising Permit). You will need to surrender the original International Zarpe from your previous port of call and provide copies of crew list, crew passports and vessel documentation.</p>
<p>(3) Go to the central Immigration office to get your Mariners Visa (see <strong><a href="Countries/Panama/?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Immigration</a> </strong>below). This will be dated to last as long as your <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities#Documents">cruising permit</a></strong>. You will need copies of the cruising permit as well as passports.</p>
<p>After Immigration, yachts must clear with <a href="Countries/Panama/?rc=Formalities#Customs"><strong>Customs</strong></a> and the Port Authority.</p>
<p>At both Balboa and Cristobal (Colon), arriving yachts may be boarded by Panamanian officials. At Cristobal they may complete all the initial clearance formalities. When the captain goes ashore to complete clearance procedures,  all others must remain on board until clearance is complete. Cruisers report that the Colon Authorities are by far the most strict and "by the book" in all of Panama. <strong>If possible, it is recommended that clearance and obtaining a cruising permit is carried out elsewhere, before arrival in Colon.</strong></p>
<p>Often in Panama clearance can be a lengthy process due to the amount of paperwork that has to be copied and processed and the number of different offices (and the bank) that have to be visited. Allow 4-5 hours over a 2 day period to be on the safe side.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/> A Permiso de Navegacion (Cruising Permit) is required by all foreign vessels sailing in Panamanian waters. These can only be issued against a valid ship (yacht) registration. See <a href="Countries/Panama/?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents and Fees</strong></a> for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic Clearance</strong></p>
<p>When sailing from one district to another in Panama (e.g. San Blas to Colon or Colon to Balboa - via the Canal - etc.) it is necessary to clear in and out between Panamanian ports where there is a Port Captain's office. You will need to check out with the Port Captain and obtain a Domestic Zarpe for the next port. On arrival, report in to the Port Captain's Office at no cost. Take with you a copy of your Cruising Permit, a printed crew list and a copy of the boat’s registration document - just in case this is asked for. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for charges.</p>
<p>If employing an <a href="Countries/Panama/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Agent</strong></a>, it is helpful for them to be present during any inspection or official visit.</p>
<p><strong>International Clearance</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>(1) Take your original Cruising Permit, </span><span>with a Crew List and crew passport copies to the Port Captain office. Here you will pay for your international Zarpe.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>(2) Have your passports stamped for exit by the local </span><span>immigration office. No fee. Immigration will require a copy of all passports, the crew list and Zarpe.</span></p>
<p><span>Officially, the day you check out of Panama for another country is the day you should depart. It is however common practice for boats on the Pacific side of Panama for example, to stop in Las Perlas for a day or two on their way westward with no problems reported to date. Whilst boardings by officials</span><span> are rare you may incur a fine of up to $500 if you linger and are boarded</span></p>
<p><span>Details of all charges can be found under "Fees" beow.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div><p>In March 2012, Panamanian Immigration Authorities introduced a new, highly  inflated immigration fee. The official statement reads:-</p>
<p><i>"The Servicio Nacional de Migracion is currently enforcing an <strong>entry permit of US$ 105,00</strong> for sea travellers piloting their own boat or yacht and arriving as a tourist. This fee permits entry into Panama for a period of three months, which can be extended for up to two years subject to an application to the Immigration authorities".</i></p>
<p><strong>The Mariners Visa</strong> can only be issued to persons arriving with the  vessel and tends to be issued for one year (or the same amount of time as the <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities#Documents">cruising permit</a></b>).</p>
<p>This visa is cancelled when you leave Panama, so another will have to be purchased if you return by yacht. If  however you are arriving/returning by other means of transport, a regular 6 Months entry  VISA will be issued at the border/airport.</p>
<p>Therefore if arriving by boat and departing by plane, you will have to surrender your Mariners Visa. On return to Panama to re-join the boat, a regular entry visa will be issued and with this you can obtain an exit zarpe.</p>
<p>This new <strong>Mariners Visa</strong> appears to be applied more consistently now throughout the various Panamanian ports.</p>
<p><i>It is important to remember that each Immigration office in Panama <strong><i>interprets</i></strong> the rules and regulations their own way. It's therefore advisable to read latest reports from cruisers and check out the various Panama nets before arrival to find the best port for entry. <span>See the report </span><a href="Members/sue/R2012-05-31-3"><strong>here</strong></a><span> for the latest updates from cruisers as to how and where different fees are being charged.</span></i></p>
<p>Apart from some eastern European, Asian and African countries who require a visa  in advance, most other nationalities can enter Panama and buy a visa on arrival.</p>
<p>If checking in or out during the weekend or outside business hours, immigration charge  an overtime fee of US$30.00 per yacht.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration at Branch Offices</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that the Immigration Offices at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Porvenir">Porvenir</a></strong> and <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Portobelo">Portobelo</a></strong> (on the Caribbean side of Panama) and <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Balboa">Balboa</a></strong> Yacht Club and Flamenco Island (on the Pacific side), are only Branch Offices. This means that  officially, they are unable to issue visas and can only issue "entry to the  country" stamps. <span>Legally, the "entry to the country" stamp permits crew 72 hrs to obtain a visa  (as per the government regulations), either in Colon or Balboa or at your next Panama port of call.</span></p>
<p><span>That said, it appers that <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Porvenir"><strong>Porvenir</strong></a> Immigration are issuing Mariner Visas. Cruisers MUST be sure however to get a receipt, as some authorities on the mainland do not recognise this stamp as an official visa so proof of payment will be required. </span></p>
<p><strong>The "72 hour rule"</strong></p>
<p>This "72 hour rule" was apparently established primarily for commercial  shipping passing the Panama Canal so that the crew do not have to appear at Immigration. Immigration officials are now applying this rule to yacht  crew, however as always, its application is inconsistent throughout Panama and its use is somewhat "murky". In actual fact, many yachts cruise the San Blas and even leave their boats  in the San Blas and fly home, and do not experience any problems re. lack of  Mariners visa at the airport (<i>See report <a href="Members/sue/R2012-05-31-3"><strong>here</strong></a></i>). Some officials at the  Immigration office in Porvenir apparently do not tell cruisers about the 72 hour  rule.</p>
<p>Be warned though, yachts are subject to being stopped and immigration papers  checked. Therefore if you have been in the country for more than 72 hours and  don't have a Mariners visa, you risk being penalized.</p>
<p>Remember also that the 72 hour rule means that if you have a flight booked within 3 days of your arrival in Panama, you will not have to buy a Mariners Visa. Be sure to show your airline ticket at check-in. When you return to Panama you will be given 30 days on arrival in Panama, enough time to gain an exit Zarpe and depart Panama, saving you the cost of the Mariners Visa.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Stay in Panama for yacht crew</strong></p>
<p>Three days (72 hours) is permitted, after which time a Mariners Visa must be purchased which permits entry into Panama for a period of three months, which can be extended for up to two years subject to an application to the Immigration authorities. However, as noted above, most offices tend to issue this visa for the same amount of time as your cruising permit (i.e. 1 calendar year).</p>
<p>Be sure to apply for an extension well in advance of your visa expiry date.</p>
<p><!--Info from 20 july 2010 which is probably not relevant now. Visas are required  but issued without charge to nationals of Colombia, Denmark, Mexico,  Netherlands, Norway and the USA. Visas are valid 30 days from the date of entry,  to be used within three months of issue. Extensions are possible for another 60  days. In the USA, visas can be obtained from: Panamanian Consulate, 201 E  Kennedy Boulevard, Suite 1400, Tampa, FL 33602, USA. Tel. 813-229-6860.--></p>

<p><strong>Bringing in Spare Parts to Panama by Air</strong></p>
<p>All arriving passengers by air to Panama, residents or visitors, have to complete a Custom Declaration upon arrival. This declaration clearly states that you do not have to declare items you are bringing in as long as the total value does not exceed US$2000.</p>
<p>If you are bringing spares or equipment with a value below US$2000, generally there is no problem and it is recommended that you have invoices covering the items you are bringing in. If you pack the items amongst your luggage (not in boxes) you should have no problems.</p>
<p>If you are bringing in items with a value exceeding US$2000, duty is payable, or for a boat in transit a transit clearance must be arranged (to avoid paying duty). Part of the transit clearance is that an inspector must accompany the items on board the boat. Normally the cost of the transit clearance is based on the value of the items and in addition you have to pay for the inspector and his transportation to and from the boat. It is difficult to advise the total cost involved as it also depends on where the boat is moored.</p>
<p>Cruisers recommend that by far the easiest way to source spare parts and even large items is to use the services of Marine Warehouse in the USA who can deliver directly to Panama with no extra taxes and reasonable freight costs (if not express).

<div><p><strong>Vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>An international yellow fever vaccination certificate may be required if you have been to a yellow fever endemic country. This includes much of South America.</p>
<p>If such a vaccination is needed, then a public health clinic in Panama City or Colon can vaccinate for as little as $5. Some other countries will require such a certificate if your passport shows that you have been to Panama.</p>
<p>There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in the provinces of Darien, San Blas, or east Panama. This does not include Panama City and the Canal Zone. Visitors should seek specialist advice about the need to receive Yellow Fever vaccine if travelling to these areas. Travellers planning to visit these provinces should obtain a yellow fever vaccine ten days prior to travel.</p>
<p>If just transiting the Canal, it is not necessary to take anti-malarial precautions, but is recommended outside the Canal Area.</p>
<p><strong>Animals</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><i>Portuguese Man 'o War </i></strong></span><br/><span>If you are stung by one (also applies to a lion fish, coral, stingrays etc.), the best remedy is HOT seawater. </span><span>Any chemical agent, or change in PH, or Salinity, or chemical composition, will trigger the stinging cells to fire more venom. For many millions of years, these things have evolved to exist in a narrow temperature band, but by increasing the temperature, it simply turns the cells into protoplasm, like soup. </span><span>Target temperature is about 50 C or 122 F, but just try to get as hot as you can tolerate.</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, noonsite has received a report from a cruising sailor who was bitten by a bat while sleeping. They were anchored in Bahia Benao near Punta Mala. It may not be a bad idea to get prophylactic rabies inoculation prior to going into areas where one might be attacked by a rabid animal.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Panama is an area of interest due to mosquito transmission risk. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p>

<div><p><strong>Cruising Permits, "Permiso de Navegacion"</strong></p>
<p>These are required by all foreign vessels sailing in Panamanian waters. As from 1st July 2010, cruising permits are now issued for one year, renewable for 1 additional year and then 1 further additional year, so 3 years in total are permitted.</p>
<p>The cruising permit is cancelled when the yacht leaves the country and a new one will have to be purchased on re-entry.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span>Cruising Permits can only be issued against a valid ship (yacht) registration and should this registration expire within the 1 year normally covered by the Cruising Permit, the permit will only be valid to the date the registration is valid (however the full amount must be paid). This really only applies to US boats (and other nationalities), whose vessel documentation shows an annual expiration date. </span><span>Upon presentation of a renewed registration a NEW permit will be issued valid for 1 year. There is some confusion amongst Panama Port Captain's about the application of this law (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/panama-tightening-up-of-how-cruising-permits-are-issued">news item</a></strong> for further details).</span></p>
<p><b>The law states that Cruising Permits must be issued by calendar year (meaning if you arrive January or June,  you still only get a permit valid to December 31st the same year). However, more and more ports are issuing the permits for one year (365 days from date of issue).</b></p>
<p>It is therefore important to note that the local authorities in each port in Panama may interpret the law in their own way.</p>
<p>See Fees for permits below.</p>
<p>Yachts clearing in Cristobal, who do not intend to stop in Balboa at all, can clear out of Panama in Cristobal, but they must do this one working day before transiting the Canal. Apparently the clearance is free in Cristobal, but costs $25 in Balboa. If intending to stop at Las Perlas or the San Blas Islands, this should be mentioned on the clearance paper by the relevant officer.</p>
<p>If a <strong>Fumigation certificate</strong> is required (i.e. if visiting the Galapagos islands) ensure that it is one issued by the Ministerio de Sanidad.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A dinghy Licence is <strong>not</strong> required by visiting yachtsmen.</p>

<div><p>Full details about the Panama Canal Transit, including fees, can be found <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Members/sue/R2012-03-14-3/">in this report.</a></strong></p>
<p>Panama is not a cheap country to visit. There are substantial fees for clearing in and cruising. Even if you are only intending to visit the San Blas Islands (for example), it will cost in the region of US$500 to clear in and cruise here, even for a short time!</p>
<p><span>Fees continue to be charged inconsistently throughout Panama's ports of entry. </span><span>It is is strongly recommended to find out in advance of your visit from cruisers that are there (via forums, Nets, reports on noonsite etc.) the best port for clearing-into the country where you can incur minimum fees.</span></p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong></p>
<p>The Servicio Nacional de Migracion is currently enforcing an entry permit (Mariner's Visa) of <strong>US$ 105,00</strong> per person for sea travellers piloting their own boat or yacht (and crew) and arriving as a tourist. This is NOT the same as a Tourist Visa. It is required for any stay longer than 72 hours and permits entry into Panama for a period of three months, which can be extended for up to two years subject to a application to the Immigration authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Cruising Permit</strong></p>
<p>Article 71 of Panama’s fiscal code now defines a one-year sailing and navigation license (cruising permit) that costs $5 and is renewable for another year.</p>
<p>Article 72 defines a temporary registration fee for private yachts: $45 for boats up to 6 meters (19.7 feet) in length, $90 for boats up to 10 meters (32.8 feet) and $180 for larger boats. The new registration is annual, but it is renewable for the same period.</p>
<p>Therefore approximate overall cost for 1 year cruising permit (depending on size of yacht) plus admin fees, is <strong>about US$205</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Fees on Checking-in</strong></p>
<p>Port Captain Declaration General: US$20</p>
<p>There may be a charge if officials have to visit your yacht to "inspect" it (approx. $60). Overtime fees are charged as well.</p>
<p><span>The Quarantine fee is US$35.</span></p>
<p>The Health Ministry fee is US$122.</p>
<p>Mandatory boat fumigation: US$53 (be sure to get a quote as charges for this can be as high as US$300).</p>
<p><span>It costs approximately $20 to take a taxi to the bank to pay all the fees.</span></p>
<p><strong>Fees on Checking-out</strong></p>
<p><span>The check-out fees are less than the entry fees.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Domestic Zarpe:</i></strong> <span>US$ 15.00 plus stamp fees.<br/>There should not be any charges on clearing into a subsequent domestic port. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>International Zarpe:</i></strong> Fees for this can vary widely and as much as US$53 charge has been reported. It seems to be wholly dependent on which office you use and who sees you.</p>
<p><span><strong>San Blas - Kuna Yala Fees</strong></span></p>
<p>If checking in at the San Blas Islands, there is a US$20 fee per 30 days for a Kuna Congress cruising permit for the islands for the boat, plus a further US$20 charge per person on board per 30 days. The only other charges appear to be for the Panama Cruising Permit and for Immigration - although latest reports are that the Kuna Yala are not enforcing this. <span>It must also be mentioned that some yachts have reported that on </span><span>several Islands, but not all, they have been asked to pay an "anchoring </span><span>fee" of approx. US$ 10.00.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:<i> </i></strong><i>Following the on-going dispute during 2015 between the  Panamanian Central Govt. and the Kuna Yala "Authorities" (KYA), whereby the KYA were trying to drastically increase the fee to visiting yachts, the </i><i>Kuna Yala Congress advise that they have </i><i>apparently cancelled the new fees published in August 2015 (see below) - however we are still </i><i>lacking some kind of official notification! Currently no yachts arriving in the San Blas have reported being charged the</i><i>increased fees!!</i></li>
<li><i>KYA fees proposed (but now cancelled) as of 1 January 2016 were: for 30 days $5.00 per square foot (length x width) plus $20.00 per person on board.</i></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Fees</strong></p>
<p><span>Yachts over 65ft must have an AIS transponder. One can be hired from the canal authorities.</span></p>
<p>For information on the latest Panama Canal transit fees (including deposits etc.), see the Panama Canal Authority Customer Form "Procedures for securing a handline transit of the Panama Canal" from their website<strong> <a href="http://www.pancanal.com">www.pancanal.com</a> </strong>(go to Maritime Operations and then to Customer Forms).</p>
<p>Fees for the National Park Area (around Isla Coiba, Isla Canal de Afuera, Isla Brincanco, Granito de Oro and Isla Rancheria) in northern Panama, have substantially increased. In 2012 they were $20 per day, per person, and a daily anchoring fee. For a 10m boat this was $30.</p>
<p>Panama has a sales tax of 7% which also includes the Banks, meaning that you pay a 7% tax on what the Bank charges for the transaction not on the whole amount of the transaction. This Tax also applies to Service Fees such as Agency fees etc.</p>
