<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE APRIL 23, 2016</strong></p>
<p>Clearing into Panama in the San Blas Islands is currently in a state of flux. There is an on-going disagreement between the Kuna Congress and the Central Government, who in turn have suspended the Port Captain and Immigration services in the San Blas pending further developments.</p>
<p><strong>The Immigration and Port Captain offices in <strong>Porvenir </strong>and Puerto Obaldia (at the far eastern end of the San Blas), are both closed until further notice.</strong></p>
<p>Vessels entering or leaving Panama on the Caribbean side will need to do so in <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/Panamamarina">Puerto Lindo</a></b><span> (which is where the Porvenir Port Captain has relocated to)</span><strong> <a class="external-link" href="../Countries/Panama/Cristobal%28Colon%29">Colon</a></strong> or <strong><a class="external-link" href="../Countries/Panama/Portobelo">Portobelo</a></strong>. Note that if you check in at Portobelo you will need to go to Colon to buy your Cruising Permit.</p>
<p>If arriving in the San Blas first, it is not advisable to take the SUV's from Carti in the San Blas Islands to Panama City or to Colon to clear in, as you will pass through police check points who will give you a hefty fine (or even arrest you) if you have not already visited an immigration office and had your passport stamped.</p>
<p>It is recommended to have the San Blas listed on your exit zarpe from your previous port (e.g. Colon via San Blas).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach through the San Blas channel could be difficult in northerly winds. In such a situation, go right round outside the reef to the southern side.</p>
<p>Approach at night, in poor visibility and without the proper waypoints can be dangerous here. Yachts have been wrecked on the reefs off Porvenir, so be extra cautious.</p>
<p>The anchorage, off the small airport, has limited space and is encumbered by reefs. It is likely to be subject to swell but does have good holding.</p>
<p>Limited provisions are available.</p>
