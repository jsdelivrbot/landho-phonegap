<div class="hello"><div><p>Located on the eastern side of the long peninsula close to the border with Costa Rica. This port is about 70 NM west of Boca Chica.</p>
<p><span>This is a commercial port </span><span>for banana export and tankers transferring crude oil etc. to the </span><span>Caribbean via the Transpanama oil pipeline. There are no </span><span>facilities for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span>As this is a not a Port of Entry frequented by yachts, in the main clearance charges are higher than those found elsewhere.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Read <b><a class="external-link" href="../GreenTurtleCayMarina/Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></b> for detailed information on procedures for clearing into and out of Panama.</i></p>
<p><b>Clearing In</b></p>
<p>If you stop here overnight having not yet cleared into Panama, the authorities will insist you check in here. As mentioned above, fees are high and it is reported to be a very slow process. Be sure to arrive early as anything after 15h30 is overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some cruisers clearing in here have reported that they were not able to get the Mariners visa here, and had to go to Panama City to get it.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing Out</strong><br/>Clearing out of Panama here however is reported to be simple and straightforward. <span>The port captain, Aduana and health will come out in a panga. They will then bring you in to process paperwork and immigration as well (cost $15 payable to the panga driver).</span></p>
<p><span>It is not recommended to take your own dinghy ashore as the pier is rough with surge and will wreck your inflatable.</span></p>
