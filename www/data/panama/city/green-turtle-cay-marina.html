<div class="hello"><div><p>Located approx. 35 miles west of the San Blas Islands and 6 miles east of Isla Grande, position 09.35.86 North / 79-26.33 West, at Punta Macolla, Playa Damas and Nombre de Dios.</p>
<p>Green Turtle Cay Marina has been under construction for some years. After partly opening in September 2011, cruisers report that much of the site has been put on hold and what has been finished has started to fall into disrepair.</p>
<p>The marina is accessed via a short canal with a depth of 10 feet, however one of the 2 orange balls to guide you in is reported to be missing. In strong easterlies this entrance can be challenging, however, once inside the marina is extremely sheltered from all directions.</p>
