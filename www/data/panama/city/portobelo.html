<div class="hello"><div><p>The national Park of Portobelo is half a day’s sail away from either the San-Blas islands or Colón, at the northern entrance of the Panama canal.</p>
<p>Portobelo is a small historical city, part of the Spanish Main (Cartagena/Portobello/San Lorenzo) and quite interesting, being visited by most yachts passing Panama. Portobelo was discoreverd by Christopher Columbus in 1502 and the city was established in 1586 as a Caribbean transhipment center for the South American riches the Spaniards took back to Spain. Several ruins can still be seen to day.</p>
<p>The City is located in the southwest corner of Bahia de Portobelo.</p>
<p>It is also the burial place of Sir Frances Drake, the 16th century English explorer.</p>
<p>Position 09° 33'N, 79° 41'W (entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Read <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/GreenTurtleCayMarina/Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></strong> for detailed information on procedures for clearing into and out of Panama.</i></p>
<p>Due to the large numbers of yachts visiting here, the Panamanian Maritime Authorities established a Port Captain and Immigration offices at Portobelo - which can now be considered a port of entry.</p>
<p><strong>Note however that the Immigration Office here is only a Branch Office</strong> under the Immigration Office in Colon. This means that officially they are unable to issue visas, and can only issue "entry to the country" stamps. Entry to the country stamps for yachts at marinas and islands, allow you 72 hrs to obtain a visa (as per the government regulations) at your next port of call (Cristobal/Bocas del Toro/Panama City).</p>
<p>In reality, if the office has visas available, they will issue them. See <a href="Countries/Panama/panama-san-blas-islands-a-report-on-the-current-situation/"><strong>this latest report</strong></a>. <span>Immigration are said to be tightening up on this rule, however this can very much depend on which immigration official you encounter.</span></p>
<p>In addition, the Port Captain is <b>not authorised to issue cruising permits</b> here, however skippers can take <span>a bus from Portobelo to Colon (2 hours - costs less than US$2) to obtain a cruising permit and visa at the same time - or </span><span>alternatively to Puerto Lindo.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Important Note: </strong><span>There is no bank in Portobelo, but there are banks and ATMs in Sabanitas, which is on the way to Colon or Panama city.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the latest updates from cruisers on immigration fees charged here, see the following <a href="Members/sue/R2012-05-31-3"><strong>Noonsite report</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Canal Transit</span><br/> If using an Agent for your canal transit, it is a strong possibility that your agent can now do all of the paperwork and payment for the canal transit in Portobelo. This means paying for your canal transit via the agent, avoiding the dangers of travelling to Colon and carrying around large amounts of cash. Whilst a day-visit to the flats in Colon is necessary to get the boat measured, the remainder of the time the boat can stay anchored in Portobelo waiting for the transit date. Do your research carefully to find a reputable agent that can do this, if it is your preferred option.<br/> See this Noonsite report, <a href="Members/sue/R2012-03-14-3/"><strong>PROCEDURES FOR TRANSITING THE PANAMA CANAL</strong></a></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to the Bahia is near 09-33N and 79-41W and yachts can anchor close to the City, except during periods of westerly winds when the northern area of the Bahia is more protected. Yachts must use their own dinghies for landing.</p>
<p>For yachts looking for a full marina berth, Panamamarina is the closest, further up the coast towards Isla Grande and San Blas near Isla Palina.</p>
<p><span>New moorings available from the Portobelo Yacht Club.</span></p>
