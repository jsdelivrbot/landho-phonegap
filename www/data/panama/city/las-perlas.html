<div class="hello"><div><p>There are plenty of anchorages to choose from, mostly deserted, though one should watch out for the 5 metre tidal range especially when landing the dinghy on the beach.</p>
<p>Contadora Island is one of the larger islands and is home to a small, elegant resort, with a small airport, hotels, restaurants, a couple of shops and a service station.</p>
<p><b>Security Note:</b> Be vigilant, an outboard motor was stolen from a dinghy on davits whilst the owners were on board here in February 2013.</p></div></div>
