<div class="hello"><div><p>Pedregal is approx. 26 miles up an estuary/river from Boca Chica. It is the port for the large city of David. You will need to enter the river on a rising tide because of the shallow water and should plan on a 2 day trip up river to Pedregal because of that. </p>
<p>Known as "The Lost Coast” of The Republic of Panama, the Chiriqui Lowlands near the city of David are famous for dozens of little islands, world class fishing, scuba diving and boating. It is among the most picturesque regions of Panama.</p>
<p>The Chiriqui gulf region encompasses Coiba Island to the East, home to some of the best sport fishing in the Pacific, and stretches West to the Costa Rican border in the Province of Chiriqui. This area includes the 14,600 acre National Wildlife Reserve-La Barqueta Beach, the 36,400 acre Gulf of Chiriqui National Marine Park and the 667,000 acre Coiba Island National Park - which is only 20% terrestrial. </p>
<p>This is the closest place to refuel if coming from Costa Rica, however it is also possible to refuel at Boca Chica with advance warning.</p>
