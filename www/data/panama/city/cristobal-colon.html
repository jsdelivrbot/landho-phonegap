<div class="hello"><div><p>Colon lies on the eastern shore of Limon Bay at the northern entrance to the Panama canal. Unfortunately the city has become an unsafe place to visit with its high crime rate and drugs problems.</p>
<p>Shelter Bay lies 2 miles away on the opposite side of Limon Bay and is a quieter, more remote place but a long way from most services.</p>
<p><strong>Shelter Bay Approach - Navigation Warning</strong><br/> When entering Shelter Bay Marina you are advised to keep at least 300 feet off the headland to your port side. It is important to follow the green channel markers as there is a reef just off the entrance. This is especially important if coming from 'the Flats' or arriving at night. Although the channel markers have flashing lights, the marina itself is only dimly lit and if arriving at night it is advisable to anchor in the 'Flats' until daylight before approaching the marina. <span>The channel can accommodate vessels with 25 feet draft.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Read <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></b> for detailed information on procedures for clearing into and out of Panama.</i></p>
<p>Cristobal Signal Station should be contacted on VHF Channels 12 or 16 and the yacht will be directed to anchor at the designated yacht anchorage in the Flats (free), or proceed directly to Shelter Bay Marina (VHF channel 74). (Note: advance reservation is recommended for Shelter Bay Marina).</p>
<p>Whether you are at Shelter Bay Marina or anchored at the Flats, the service of agents are available for both clearance and/or canal transits if yachts are prepared to pay for the service and don't want to do the paperwork etc. themselves. See Clearance Agents for listings.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong></p>
<p>The captain should go ashore and clear Immigration first (see "getting ashore" below under "Docking"). The office is open 07:00-15:00 Monday to Friday. After hours clearance can be obtained from the Immigration office in Cristobal.</p>
<p><strong>Port Captain</strong></p>
<p>Next the captain should go to the Autoridad Portuaria (port authority) to clear into Panama and obtain a cruising permit. A new computer system means that this can take anything up to 10 days! The Port Captain's office is in the Panama Canal Commission building 1105, 3rd floor.</p>
<p>Clearance is completed at the Port Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Shelter Bay Marina</strong></p>
<p>There are now Port Authority and Immigration based at Shelter Bay Marina, <b>however a trip into Colon will be required</b> in order to get the cruising permit (approx. taxi cost from Shelter Bay $60). Officials are present approx. 10.00-13.00 (until 15.00 for the Port Captain) and the process can be slow with long queues.</p>
<p><span>To speed up the process, you can get photocopies in the Dock Shop for 50c each.</span></p>
<p><strong>Yachts already cleared-into Panama</strong></p>
<p>If you have already cleared into Panama, you will still need to visit the Port Captain's office with a <span>copy of your Cruising Permit, </span><span>a printed crew list (they have forms available if you don’t already have one), a</span><span> copy of all crew passports, y</span><span>our Zarpe from the last Panamanian port and a</span><span> copy of the boat’s registration document. Immigration</span><span> will also want a copy of your crew list and passports. There should be no charge.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the latest updates from cruisers on immigration fees charged here, see the following <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2012-05-31-3">report</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canal Transit</strong></p>
<p>If intending to transit the Canal, see<b> <a href="Members/sue/R2012-03-14-3/">here</a></b> for the correct procedure to follow once clearing-in to Panama has been completed.</p>
<p>It is considered dangerous to walk anywhere at any time, day or night, so a taxi should be used at all times to visit the various offices.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts have a choice of staying at the marina at Shelter Bay (advisable to book in advance) or  anchoring out in the Flats "Anchorage Area F" (for small boats and vessels) next to pier 16 (Cristobal Muelle H-16), which is free. Pier 16 is a busy commercial pier, there is no club house or fuel. Drinking water can be taken at the dock.</p>
<p>It is not possible to anchor off Shelter Bay Marina, the only yachts that anchor here are those waiting a few hours for a slip to become available. <span>Shelter Bay Marina is situated in a more picturesque place than the anchorage, albeit rather isolated: great hiking, birding, tropical flora and fauna all within a five minute walk.  There is a regular bus service to both Panama City and the big shopping centers in Quatros altos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Other Anchorages<br/></strong><span>For a detailed guide to Panama City anchorages see </span><a href="http://dominocatamaran.blogspot.com/2013/09/panama-city-anchorages.html" target="_blank"><strong>http://dominocatamaran.blogspot.com/2013/09/panama-city-anchorages.html</strong></a><br/> There is a very small (unofficial) anchorage area off the Club Nautico Colon, on the east side of Colon at Manzanillo Bay. This Club was generally not considered by visiting yachts when the Panama Canal Yacht Club existed, but is now seen as an alternative. If you want to anchor off the club for a day or two and pay to use their landing, ask permission first on VHF or call 507-441-2220. If they have a tournament coming up, they may say no. They are a private club, not a marina.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that boats use the Club Nautico anchorage as it is not patrolled by the Panama Canal Police boats and a cruising boat was boarded and robbed at night here in March 2012. It offers easy access with a small boat, there are frequent wakes, and the anchorage is exposed to the north - consequently it encounters severe swells in certain conditions. For boats who wish to anchor while provisioning, arrange for canal transit or conduct other business, anchorage F remains the safest, if more inconvenient, option.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that Largo Remo Island just a couple miles east from Colon breakwaters, has a sheltered anchoring corner (avoid shipping lanes into Las Minas), and someone is attempting to install inexpensive moorings and make a little marina out of it.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the Rio Chagres (about 6 miles south of Shelter Bay). This has fresh/brackish water and is reported to have fewer bugs than the mangrove-lined Shelter Bay complex. To access Colon for provisioning one can meet taxis at the dam (also referred to as the Tarpon Club - an old nightclub nearby) at the head of the river (about $15 with 4 persons and bags).</p>
<p>Portobello is also easy access to Colon and a nice place to anchor, although bringing large loads from the shopping centers is not so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong><br/> If anchored in the Flats, there is no longer any official dinghy landing area here. It is possible to use the official launch service which services the commercial vessels. This brings you ashore in the commercial Port of Cristobal, however this service is very expensive. Some locals, like Tito, offer an unofficial shore service, landing around dock 16 Cristobal or dock 5 in Colon, the latter not being in a safe area of Colon!</p>
<p>Unofficially, you can land at the small beach at the head of Pier 16 and walk 300 ft. to the port gate. There is a big dumpster where you land. This Pier is just east of the Flats and is a very short run. You can land here but there are no facilities to leave the dinghy. Show passports and ship's crew list to the guard at the gate and you can take a taxi to the shopping mall or to clear in.</p>
<p><b>Cruisers VHF Net - Caribbean side of Panama<br/></b><span><b>Shelter Bay Marina</b><br/></span><span>VHF Channel 77 every morning at 7.30am</span></p>
<p><strong>Wildlife</strong><br/> Alligators are present here (up to approx. 4ft long). Alligators (Caimanes) are a common feature of the Panama coastline, and you may be fortunate enough to see a 13 footer in Gatun lake while crossing the canal, but these are rare. It's also important to be aware that there are manantees, should you be carrying out any underwater jobs.</p>
