<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Read <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/GreenTurtleCayMarina/Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></b> for detailed information on procedures for clearing into and out of Panama.</i></p>
<p>There is Immigration in the port as well as the Port Authority (Autoridad Maritima), where you can do all the other paperwork and get the cruising permit or a national or international zarpe.</p>
<p>If the Immigration office is closed, just wait for the next day or go to the "Migration" office in Santiago to get your passports stamped. Just take the bus (1.30$) and then a taxi to "Migration" (1$).</p>
<p>It is reported to be very straightforward and only minimal fees are charged.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a place near the public floating dock, where you can leave the dinghy. Here, there is also a gas station with diesel and gasoline and free water.</p>
<p>Close by are a few restaurants and a Chinese grocery store. The owners of the store are very helpful and will order in any product that you may need.</p>
<p>If you wish for a bigger selection, go to Santiago by bus.<br/> Opposite the bus station is the big supermarket "Super Carnes". You can also get off the bus by the supermarket "Super 99" in the town centre. There is an even bigger "Super Carnes" at Avenida Central. When you're finished, you can get a taxi back to Puerto Mutis with all your shopping for around 15$.</p>
<p>If needing something from the Allbrock Mall in Panama, just take the first bus in the morning and return with an afternoon bus.</p>
