<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a good anchorage but there are no yacht pontoons in place at the proposed marina site.</p>
<p>There is a small yard which launches and recovers small motorboats past the town around the north point. This is owned by Carlos Spragge, a well known diver master who also runs a dive operation. <span>Carlos is a very hospitable and fun man who offers his dinghy dock and friendly atmosphere. <span>There are only a few spots for anchoring here and a few mooring buoys, so it's advisable to make arrangements in advance by calling on Channel 16.</span></span> It is possible to get fuel here with advance warning, come alonside the pontoon at slack tide. Call 507-775-3185.</p>
<p>If heading up to Carlos' place, b<span>e aware that there is an unmarked reef in front of the town, not mentioned in several guide books. T</span><span>he current runs very fast in the narrow channel in front of the town at peak periods and yachts should stay to the far starboard side to avoid the reef. There are also unmarked overhead power lines across the channel just before the reef, so the transit in front of the town needs to be done at low(ish) tides to avoid the power lines for boats with high masts. Call Carlos on VHF Ch.16 and he will guide you through the channel. </span></p>
<p>The three hotels here all have restaurants and bars, and are cruiser friendly places. The village has a small provision store.</p>
<p>There is a bus to David, the nearest large town, for more serious shopping.</p>
