<div class="hello"><div><p>Cebaco Bay Sports Fishing Club is located at the southern end of Isla Cebaco (07deg 29.3'N, 81deg 13.3W).</p>
<p>A 110ft mothership "Cebaco Bay" is moored in the southern cove <span>Ensendada del Naranjo (Caleta Cayman)</span><span style="text-align: justify; "> year round and supports fly-in fishing charters. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "></span><span style="text-align: justify; ">They provide fuel (March 2014: $6.50 per gallon (no tax)), have fresh spring water piped in from a deep water spring on the island (potable), </span><span>supplies, moorings, a restaurant and accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>This is a well run operation with very friendly staff, although of course t</span></span><span>here is quite a premium for this service.</span><span style="text-align: justify; "> </span><span>They monitor VHF Channel 6 and it's e</span><span style="text-align: justify; ">asy to pull alongside.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">As well as the moorings for rent, you can <span style="text-align: justify; ">drop your anchor anywhere outside the mooring area. It can be a bit rolly, especially during the night.</span></span></p>
