<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a convienient port of entry for Panama if coming from Colombia.</p>
<p>Note that as of of May 2016 it is now closed to <span>Colombians, Africans and Cubans, </span>in an attempt to stem the migrant flow from Colombia. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://news.trust.org/item/20160509171039-znpup">news article</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p><span>The anchorage here is often untenable and should not be relied upon. </span></p>
<p>Puerto Obaldia has a large military/police presence because inland, the Darien border between Colombia and Panama is a major drug smuggling highway.</p>
<p><span>A convenient place from which to visit the memorable town of Sapzurro Colombia and the southern, very unspoiled portion of Guna Yala.</span></p>
<p>Position 08° 40'N, 77° 24'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></strong> for full details on clearing into Panama.</p>
<p>There are Immigration and Customs offices here.</p>
<p><span>The next nearest port for clearance is Porvenir, Portobelo, or Colon.</span></p>
<!-- Original clearance info To clear in, row ashore and secure the dinghy to a tree. Show your passport at the police stop and then proceed past an army post and over a footbridge to the immigration and customs offices. Officials are said to be courteous and efficient. A Panama cruising permit may be optional here, but eventually you will have to get one because you cannot get a zarpe to leave the country without one. Be sure to check that the end date on your cruising permit is for a whole 365 days and not just for the remainder of the calendar year - the mistake can be corrected in Colon but it is a nuisance. If your Colombian Zarpe lists your destination as Puerto Obaldia and weather prevents you entering there, avoid Porvenir and make your Panama entry in Portobelo, where your situation will be treated with sympathy. You will also be required to pay for a Zarpe to be in the jurisdiction of Puerto Obaldia ($1.50) and a Zarpe to transit from Puerto Obaldia to your next port in Panama ($20). There is also an anchoring fee ($3) plus a lights and buoys charge ($3). Cruisers have reported that immigration officials here cannot issue maritime visas and prefer that you obtain these at Porvenir. Later reports indicate that in fact clearing into Panama here is no longer possible either, only clearing out. -->

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at (08°39.84N, 77°25.33W) is a bay offering no protection when waves are from the NW. Your boat needs to be under constant watch because of the swell. The holding is poor. It is recommended to talk and listen to the locals, they have seen some boats stranded.</p>
