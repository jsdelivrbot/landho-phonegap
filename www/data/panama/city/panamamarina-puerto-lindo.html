<p><span>El Porvenir AMP (Port Captain from the San Blas) has relocated to</span><span> Linton Bay Marina and is open every day, included Saturday and Sunday. Saturday, Sundays and Holidays there is an extra $ 20,00 Charge. Hours are 8am to 4pm. <span>The office is in the same building as the marina office, just before the entrance to the docks.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Costs are $ 12,00 for a Zarpe to exit Panama and $ 195,00 to enter, including a Cruising Permit (payable in cash).</span></p>
<p><span><b>Important Note: </b>There is no bank in Linton Bay (Puerto Lindo) or in Portobelo, but there are banks and ATMs in Sabanitas, which is on the way to Colon or Panama city.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>There is currently no Immigration here - however there should be very soon. The closest is in Portobelo (a short inexpensive bus ride away) or Colon/Panama City.</span></p>
<p>The stamp given on arrival is good for 72 hours, giving you enough time to visit Immigration for your visa.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance channel to the Panamarina <i>(see photo above)</i><span> is equipped with green (starboard) and red (port) buoys and the first 4 are fitted with a flag for better visibility from offshore.</span></p>
<p>Once inside the anchorage, two stand-by mooring buoys (painted white) can be found in the middle. Call the marina on VHF 69 and a tender will come and assist. Whilst this is called a marina, there are no docks, just mooring buoys.</p>
