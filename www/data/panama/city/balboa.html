<div class="hello"><div><p>Balboa has been said by many to be "cruiser-unfriendly" with regards to safe moorings. For those transiting the Canal from Colon and arriving in Balboa at 0300, this may well be true. Finding a mooring field or safe place to anchor in the dark is difficult here and the marinas are very expensive. If planning a canal transit, be sure to talk to cruisers about the best place to stop on the other side beforehand.</p>
<p><b>Cruisers VHF Net:</b> <span>This runs Monday through Saturday 0800 local time (1300 UTC). Currently VHF 74, however this does change due to quantity of local traffic. E</span>ach season cruisers establish a weekly get together, always announced on the local VHF Net.</p>
<p><strong>Security Warning:</strong> <span>Nowhere in Panama should yachts anchor at night in remote areas without being accompanied by other yachts. </span><span>The latest incident occured south of Taboga Island (7nm south of Balboa), a yacht anchored there alone was boarded by three armed men. See report <a class="external-link" href="General/Piracy/panama-balboa-taboga-island-south-cruising-yacht-at-anchor-attacked-by-armed-gunmen-2013-march-2014/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Read <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/GreenTurtleCayMarina/Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></strong> for detailed information on procedures for clearing into and out of Panama.</i></p>
<p><span>On the Pacific side of the canal, Flamenco Signal Sation should be contacted on VHF Channels 12 </span><span>or 16 when moving across or through the marked canal channel. Flamenco Signal may or may not </span><span>respond.</span></p>
<p><strong>Immigration &amp; Port Captain: Panama City</strong></p>
<p>The Immigration offices at the Balboa Yacht Club and Flamenco Island are classed as "Branch Offices". This means they can stamp your passport with Entry to the Country stamps (valid for 72 hours), but Mariners visas must be obtained<span> </span><span>if you are intending on staying longer than 72 hours.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>(1) Present your passport at either one of these Immigration offices (Balboa Yacht </span><span>Club or Flamenco Island - on the second floor of the building which houses the Duty Free </span><span>Store) to obtain your 72 hour visa. You will need to also provide copies of your </span><span>International Zarpe, crew list and passports. </span></p>
<p><span>(2) </span><span>Go to the Port Captain's office on Flamenco Island (above the Duty Free Store). There you will </span><span>receive a “Declaration General” and your Cruising Permit. You will need to surrender the </span><span>original International Zarpe from your previous port of call and provide copies of the crew list, </span><span>crew passports and vessel documentation.</span></p>
<p><i><span> </span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Obtaining the Cruising Permit may take two days (one day to request it, returning the </span><span>next day to get it).</span></i></p>
<p><span>(3) </span><span>Go to the Immigration office in Albrook District (NOT Albrook Mall) to obtain the </span><span>Mariner's Visas. </span><span>The Mariner Visa will be dated to last as long as your Cruising Permit. </span><span>You will need copies of your Cruising Permit as well as passport copies. </span></p>
<p><span>The office is </span><span>located on Calle Diego Dominguez on the 3</span><span>rd </span><span>floor of the Albrook Office Center building. </span><span>Take the road just to the east of the Rey grocery store. Make the first right onto Calle </span><span>Diego Dominquez and proceed about 1/4 mile.</span></p>

<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Departing from Panama City on an International Zarpe: </span></p>
<p><span>(1) Take your original Cruising Permit, </span><span>with a Crew List and crew passport copies to the Port Captain's office on Flamenco Island (see </span><span>above). Cost approx. US$12.20. </span></p>
<p><span>(2) Have your passports stamped for exit by either of the satellite </span><span>immigration offices (Balboa Yacht Club or Flamenco Island). No fee. Immigration will require a </span><span>copy of all passports, the Crew List and Zarpe.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p id="content"><span>The Pacific Ocean entrance channel to the Canal is protected on the east by a breakwater called </span><span>"The Causeway" (also “La Calzada de Amador” and “ Avenida Amador”) that extends south two </span><span>miles from Balboa on the mainland to four interconnected islands (listed in order from Balboa to </span><span>the outer extreme): Naos, Culebra, Perico, and Flamenco.</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Anchorages</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Las Brisas Anchorage<br/>North west of Isla Perico, on The Causeway.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong><span>This anchorage tends to be used during the rainy </span><span>season (April­December) due to prevailing S/SE winds. It can be quite rough during the dry season </span><span>due to N/NE gap winds. During the rainy seaon expect frequent, sudden and violent storm squalls.</span></p>
<p>That said, holding in the main is excellent as long as you follow a few simple rules:<br/><span>1) Back-up strongly on the anchor</span><span> </span><span>to test the hold;<br/></span><span>2) Put out at least 150' of chain (not just rode) at the</span><span> </span><span>bottom; and<br/></span><span>3) Give the boats around you ample swinging room.</span></p>
<p><span> There are a couple of places where the bottom is gravel/construction debris with bad holding, however the rest<span> </span>of the anchorage is mostly mud and shell. </span></p>
<p><span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></span></p>
<p><span>Access to the shore is via a non-maintained dinghy dock, currently free to yachtsmen. This landing is closer to the anchorage than the one at Flamenco Marina, however getting ashore can be a problem as the dock's access ladder to shore has sunk. </span><span>Currently you have to dinghy to the steps, or </span><span>rocks (low tide) to drop off your crew, return to the floating dock to secure the dinghy, then get </span><span>ashore via a small rubber plastic dingy attached to the shore.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Use of the docks at Flamenco Marina for dinghy landing is limited; check in advance for costs and availability (see listing below).</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Sunken sailboat at N 08 55.309 and W 079 32.107</span></p>
<p><span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></span></p>
<p><strong>La Playita Anchorage<br/>Located outside the breakwater of the La Playita Marina, on the south side of The Causeway. </strong></p>
<p><span>The anchorage here is protected from strong winds and waves from the north and east, yet you are continuously exposed to the wake of transiting canal vessels and their related work boats which speed through the anchorage. Holding is poor with a hard bottom.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Access to shore is via the Marina's dinghy dock - available to cruisers for a fee of <span>$57 per week - no daily fees anymore. </span></span><span>(Note: there is a chance that if you arrive on a Sunday you pay $57, and then $57 again on the Monday for the following week! Try asking nicely and they might prorate the fees).</span></p>

There are also showers, laundry, WiFi and haul out facilities, using a railway.<br>
You can get diesel at the dock but call ahead (it is not always available). If you purchase fuel you can fill your water tanks at no additional charge. This is a working dock with much commercial traffic, you will not be allowed to tarry and may have to wait for traffic to clear before approaching. You may also be charged an hourly rate to be at the dock.<br>
Fees Feb. 2015:<br>
The fee for obtaining a temporary mooring ball is $0.85 per foot per day for monohulls and $1.00 per foot per day for multihulls, with a 7% sales tax.<br>
A fee is required to drop off advisers, fenders and lines here after a canal transit. The fee is based on the number of fenders and persons: $1 per fender, $4 per person.
