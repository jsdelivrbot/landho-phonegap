<div class="hello"><div><p>Bocas del Toro is on the north eastern coast of Panama, about 20nm from the border with Costa Rica, outside the hurricane zone. This is a beautiful, un-crowded cruising ground, with many unspoilt anchoarges and three good marinas to choose from.</p>
<p>Position 9°20'N, 82°14.5'W.</p>
<p>The old commercial channel is located between Isla Bastimentos and Isla Carenero. Charts show buoys marking this channel. HOWEVER, this channel is no longer used by commercial traffic and there are NO BUOYS marking this channel now. It remains navigable and is still the primary channel used by non-commercial traffic.</p>
<p>The new commercial channel is now located northwest of the above channel, between the mainland and Bocas del Drago. It is well marked and well lit.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i>For full details on clearing into and out of Panama see the noonsite page <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama?rc=Formalities">Panama Formalities</a></strong>. </i></p>
<p>Port Captain, Customs and Immigration are located in Bocas Town.</p>
<p>If you have already cleared into Panama with Immigration, Customs and a Port Captain, and you have a zarpe, then you only need to give the zarpe to the Bocas Port Captain when you go to town (closes at 3pm, Monday to Friday).</p>
<p>A zarpe is required in Panama when leaving the country of Panama, or when leaving the waters controlled by one Port Captain and entering waters controlled by another Port Captain (i.e., moving between different jurisdictions).  Bocas del Toro has a different Port Captain from the one that controls the Shelter Bay area.</p>
<p>If you are arriving from outside of Panama, then the Port Captain will come to your boat with the Customs, Immigration and Health officers and clear you in (around 6 officials).</p>
<p>Non-overtime costs to clear in here: <br/>Boarding Services					$170.00 <br/>Cruising Permit (Valid one year/12 Months)		$193.00 <br/>Panama VISA per person (Valid one year/12 Months)	$105.00</p>
<p>Non-overtime costs to clear out here:<br/>Exit Zarpe - approx. US$5<br/>Customs and Immigration charge - US$40 per person</p>
<p>Note however that overtime charges (arriving at the weekend and after 3pm week days) have been reported as being as much as US$60.</p>
<p>Payment must be made ashore at the port office.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are three marina choices in Bocas, plus over 50 unspoiled anchorages in the area.</p>
<p>Bocas Marina has been popular for over a decade and still receives glowing reports from cruisers. It is a short dinghy ride from Bocas town.</p>
<p>Marina Carenero sits on an island that looks across to Bocas Town.  It is the least expensive of the local marinas.</p>
<p>Red Frog Marina is quite a distance from town, <span>located on </span><span>Isla Bastimentos and </span><span>is now part of the Island Global Yachting (IGY) network of marinas. </span><span>It is only a few years old and nicely maintained.  Aside from cruising boats, they are also trying to attract mega-yachts. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Take care at night as many of the water taxis do not display running lights in the evening and travel at speed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The boatyard here - Bocas Yacht Services - has haulout facilities up to 60 tons and is located next to Almirante on the mainland. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Panama/BocasdelToro?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyards</a></strong> for more information.</span></p>
<p><span>Bocas town is a relaxed, fun place, with easy provisioning, hardware stores, repair shops, restaurants and bars.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Every morning at 0745 there is a Cruisers and Expats Net on VHF channel 68.  There is also a 24/7 emergency radio network if anyone is in difficulty or injured.</span></span></p>
