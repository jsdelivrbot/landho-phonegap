<div class="hello"><div><p>The quay is visible as you come through the narrow entrance to the harbor and only the east side is suitable for mooring a yacht due to tidal range. Other local boats may well raft alongside.</p>
<p>There is a small market in Augpilagtoq with limited supplies. Showers and laundry are available. There are no refueling facilities.</p>
