<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../greenland-pics/nuuk-harbour_jimmy-cornell/@@images/image/preview"/>Nuuk is the capital, the largest city of Greenland, and the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. It is however probably one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population <i>(photo by Jimmy Cornell, Midsummers Day 2014)</i>.</p>
<p>It is located at the mouth of the Nuup Kangerlua (Danish: Godthåbsfjorden) inlet on the west coast of Greenland, about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>The old city name was Godthåb ("Good Hope") in Danish, although since 1979, when home rule was granted to Greenland, the official name of the city has been Nuuk, its Greenlandic name.</p>
<p>The town centre is a 20 minute walk up the hill from the harbour and left at the roundabout. Everything is available in Nuuk, 3 different supermarkets, even a mall with everything you can dream of at European quality.</p>
<p>As of 2014, a new harbour is under construction for  large to medium sized ships, which will release a lot of space in the old  harbour. It is s expected to be completed by 2016.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Nuuk has a very safe, protected harbour, however it's very busy and there is alot of traffic all year long</p>
<p>As of summer 2014, the port authority have cleared up  the main docking facility for yachts (Lystbådehavnen) which was cluttered with abandoned  boats or long term liveaboards. Some  electric access points have been installed and as a result a fee will be charged for docking here. It is unclear how much for now.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to moor at any of the commercial docks: while no one will complain (very peaceful society)  movements around the clock forbid you to leave the boat alone or just  for a few hours.</p>
<p>Anchoring is possible inside the harbour but not very  practical.</p>
<p>Right at the centre of the harbour, there are two strong moorings normally with abandoned boats attached. It is possible to berth alongside these boats and use the moorings.</p>
<p>The Nuuk shipyard side of the harbour is very busy as well and movements are constant. Whilst haulout and all repairs are possible here, prices are very high.</p>
