<div class="hello"><div><p>Narsaq is a town in the Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland. The name Narsaq is Greenlandic for "plain", referring to the beautiful plain on the shore of Tunulliarfik Fjord where the town is located.</p>
<p>With 1,613 inhabitants as of 2010, it is the ninth-largest town in Greenland.</p>
<p>This is a useful Port of Entry for Greenland if coming from Southeast Labrador. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The downside of this harbour is that it is a 25 NM motor up the Skovfiord from the sea. However, this does mean it is very well protected from winds in any quarter.</p>
<p>On the trip up from the Davis strait there will undoubtedly be numerous bergy bits and small icebergs to contend with. It is advisable to contact Ice Central in advance to determine current conditions. If planning on anchoring outside the harbour, these bergy bits could be a problem should the wind get up.</p>
<p>Inside the L shaped, but rather small commercial pier, there is complete protection. There is no charge for dockage.</p>
<p>There are two supermarkets with good quality provisions and fuel is available at a floating dock just outside the commercial dock. Internet is available at the very helpful tourist information center. No laundry facilities other than machines at a hostel followed by air drying.</p>
