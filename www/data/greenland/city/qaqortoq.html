<div class="hello"><div><p>With double the population of Narsaq, Qaqortoq is reported to be the most populous town in southern Greenland and the fourth largest in all of Greenland. </p>
<p>While exposed to the south, cruisers have reported that during July and August there was little ice in the passage leading to the harbour so the approach is straightforward. This harbour would however offer poor protection if the wind is blowing freshly from the south.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts need to find a suitable berth at the commercial dock, which may take some juggling and several moves until the right spot is found. There is no charge for dockage.</p>
<p>Qaqortoq has four well stocked supermarkets (which sell alcohol). The Seaman’s Home provides showers (at a healthy charge), laundry and inexpensive meals. There is also a floating fuel dock. </p>
