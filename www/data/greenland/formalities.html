<div><p>In spite of its association with Denmark, Greenland is not a member of the EU and therefore all arriving boats must follow the usual clearance procedure and make their first stop at a port of entry.</p>
<p>Contact the port authorities well in advance of arrival for special permission to enter the ports, if possible 24 hours beforehand on VHF Channels 12 or 16.</p>
