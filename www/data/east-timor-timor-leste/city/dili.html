<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is very well protected from south easterlies but slightly exposed to the north westerlies during the monsoon season (November - late March).</p>
<p>The yacht anchorage is on the port side of the main wharf, located at approximately S8° 33.10’ and E125° 34.5’.  Take particular note of the small reef in the centre of the yacht anchorage area. <span>Beware of a poorly marked drying patch and an unmarked wrecks in the harbour. The holding is good in the soft mud once the anchor is dug in. The inadequate ground tackle and long floating lines of some local boats can also cause a hazard in bad weather.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dili Bay Moorings<br/></strong>In the order of 20-25 permanent moorings are located in Dili Bay for use by visiting yachts at times when they are not being used by Darwin Dili Rally yachts (some fees may apply). These moorings were installed in 2012 and are inspected and refurbished annually. Sail Timor-Leste makes no warranty as to their fitness for purpose and yachts which use the moorings do so at their own risk.</p>
<p><b>Dili Beach Security<br/></b><span>The anchorage is located directly in front of the Maritime Police Offices, which oversees security.  Dinghies should be beached as close as possible to Maritime Police Offices.</span></p>
<p><span>Local guides are very helpful and can be trusted to look after the boat is leaving to explore ashore fo a few days. Jim, who runs a charter business here, can advise.</span></p>
<p>Although Dilli is the best harbour, Atauro Island and Com are also very attractive.</p>
