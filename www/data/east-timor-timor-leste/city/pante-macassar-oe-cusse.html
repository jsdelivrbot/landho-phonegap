<div class="hello"><div><p>This small town lies 100nm west of Dili, on the north coast of Timor. It is in the small enclave of Timor Leste, which is separated from the main part of the country. Its main link with the rest of the country is the weekly ferry from Dili.</p>
<p>Currently the area is undergoing significant upgrades to its infastructure. A very welcoming community and an interesting place to visit.</p>
<p>Position 09° 11'53"S, 124° 22'10"E (anchorage)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are few facilities for cruisers, but the holding in the sand at the anchorage off the town is excellent.</p>
