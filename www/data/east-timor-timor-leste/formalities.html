<div><p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/EastTimor/Dili">Dili</a></strong>, the capital, is the official entry/exit port for yachts visiting Timor-Leste.</p>
<p>On arrival, the following flags should be hoisted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code flag Q </li>
<li>Yacht National Flag </li>
<li>Timor-Leste courtesy flag (if available). </li>
</ul>
<p>You may then proceed to the yacht anchorage on the port side of the main wharf. The yacht anchorage is located at approximately S8° 33.10’ and E125° 34.5’. Take particular note of the small reef in the centre of the yacht anchorage area. After entering the harbour you will notice 2 yellow quarantine buoys on your port side.  These are NOT to be used by vessels as they have shifted during heavy weather and now sit on top of reef.</p>
<p><strong>Inwards Clearance Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Papers for clearance into Timor-Leste: <span>Yacht Registration Certificate, a</span><span> crew list, all passports and USD$30 per crew member for Visa fees, t</span><span>he </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Port Clearance</span><span> from your last port of call.</span></p>
<p><span>After anchoring, the captain and all crew should come ashore and report to the Maritime Police on the foreshore of Dili Bay. They are open <span>between the hours of 0900-1600 (with normally a long break for lunch). </span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span>Follow the directions of the Maritime Police, which will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">generally</span> be to proceed to the Dili Port Authority for inwards Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, Health and Port clearance.  All CIQP officials have offices at the Dili Port Authority. The Customs office is by the gate to the Post, in front of the Hotel Timor.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Quarantine officials will interview the captain of yacht and decide whether they will be making an inspection of the vessel.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>On completing inwards clearance, you will be provided with a </span><span>Clearance Form stamped by Customs, &amp; Quarantine, plus a</span><span> formal receipt for visa fees &amp; a visa stamped in each passport.</span></p>
<p>A crew member must return to the yacht and take down the yellow “Q” flag and hoist the courtesy flag if you had to purchase it in Dili.</p>
<p>Latest report is that clearance is quick and hassle-free. Ensure you submit copies of the various documents as they may not be returned.</p>
<p>A useful place to land the dinghy while clearing in, is just to the left of the ramp to the car ferry.</p>
<p><strong>Outwards Clearance Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Go to the Dili Port Authority with all passports for outward processing. An Outward Crew List should also be provided. You will be processed through Immigration and Customs and provided with a Port Clearance from Dili.  This Port Clearance will be needed at your next port of entry.</p>
<p>You will also be provided with a Sailing Authorisation for Timor-Leste waters. The Sailing Authorisation allows yachts (which have already cleared from Timor-Leste) to visit all waters and ports of Timor-Leste including Atauro Island and the enclave of Oecusse.  The Port Authority/Harbour Master will issues Sailing Authorisations as yachts clear from Dili (and Timor-Leste). Sailing Authorisations are valid for a maximum stay of 3 months in Timor-Leste provided all crew have valid visa extensions for the period of the Sailing Authorisation.</p>
<p>For yachts travelling onwards to Indonesia, yachts are welcome to stopover at the Timor-Leste enclave, Oecusse, which is located on the north coast of West Timor (approximate co-ordinates S09° 10' E124° 20').  Oecusse (also known as Pante Makassar) is almost equidistant from Dili and Kupang (approximately 90 NM from Dili and from Kupang).  Oecusse will be automatically included on your Timor-Leste Sailing Authorisation so there is no need to decide about this destination in advance.</p>

<div><p>Timorese traditions of clothing are modest. Garments above the knee (for both men and woman) are rarely acceptable in a professional or traditional social occasion.</p>
<p>Dress standards mean a lot in Timor-Leste. Smart casual clothes are ideal especially when dealing with officials and it is best not to wear expensive jewellery when you are out and about.</p>
<p>When visiting remote islands or villages, basic protocols and respect for local customs and people should be adopted.</p>
<p>It is polite to wait until your host invites you to sit down, or to eat and drink.</p></div>
