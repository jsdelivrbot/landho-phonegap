<div><ul>
<li>The latest country to join the community of independent nations, East Timor (Timor-Leste) has only recently shaken off its colonial past. While hardly a cruising destination in its own right, westbound boats from Australia can make at least a short stop in this small country which, for the last three decades, has been the focus of international news.</li>
<li>In 1999, in a UN-supervised referendum, the people of East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an independent state. Up-to-date confirmation concerning entry formalities is best obtained from one of the East Timorese missions in the neighbouring countries, such as the one in Darwin.</li>
<li>Reports are that basic repair facilities in Dili are good, but provisions tend to be more expensive than elsewhere due to most having to be imported. It is also reported that checking in procedures are very straightforward here.</li>
