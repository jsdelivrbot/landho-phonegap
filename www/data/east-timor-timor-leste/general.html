<p>Note - A UN correspondent reports "power is poor in the country with frequent brownouts and blackouts.  I suspect that surges are frequent as we go through a lot of surge-protecting power bars."  Further he reports than Type I is common as much construction is done by Australians; type C is common in building built during Indonesian occupation; type E is less common; type F is common in offices but not hotels.</p>
