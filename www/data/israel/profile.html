            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>The Israeli coast is low with no natural harbours or anchorages and visiting yachts have the choice of only a few marinas and ports. An unexciting coastline, stringent security controls and recurring internal problems have kept most cruising yachts away from this interesting country. </li>
<li>The few foreign yachts that make the detour to reach Israel during a cruise of the Eastern Mediterranean are rewarded with the opportunity to visit many of the well-known ancient sites. A sojourn in Israel also provides a unique opportunity to experience and perhaps understand some of the reasons for the continuing tension in the Middle East.</li>
<li>Although not a prime cruising destination, Israel's yachting facilities have been steadily improving to cater for an expanding resident boating community. </li>
<li>The Haifa-Kishon marina inside Haifa Harbour has meant a significant improvement to facilities in the north of the country. </li>
<li>Limited facilities are available at Eilat, Israel's port on the Red Sea, where the new marina has expanded into the nearby lagoon. </li>
<li>Note: there is no public transport during "Shabat". (Friday evening until Saturday evening).</li>
<li>If planning a passage that passes close to Israel, best advice is to stand well outside 12nm off the Israel coast unless visas, and boat permissions, have already been negotiated.</li>

<div><p>The<strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel"> FCO</a></strong> and other organisations advise against all but essential travel to areas of Israel within 40km of the border with Gaza (including Sderot, Netivot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Be’er Sheva, and Kiryat HaMalachi). Be sure to check the<b> <a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel">FCO</a></b> website for the latest security information.</p>
<p><span>Since July 2014 hundreds of rockets have been fired into southern Israel from Gaza, landing in cities including Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beer Sheva. Rockets have also been fired at central Israel, including Tel Aviv, and further north towards Haifa. </span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers in <span>Herzliya Marina, near Tel Aviv (further north than expected attacks), have reported that periodically they have been asked to use the marina bomb shelter.</span></span></p>
