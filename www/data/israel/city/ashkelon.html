<div class="hello"><div><p>Ashkelon Marina is a full service modern marina, providing 600 berths, 100 ton travel lift and docking services. Favorite among cruising sailors especially those coming from the South, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, a good spot for wintering afloat or ashore and a favourite starting point towards the Med. The marina entrance is tricky in strong winds or swell and it is recommended to confirm with the marina in advance if it is safe for you particular vessel.</p>
<p>On arrival tie up at the guest dock which is conveniently near the marina offices and the fuel station.</p>
<p>Israel does not levy charges for visas or cruising permits though there is a NIS70 departure tax.</p>
