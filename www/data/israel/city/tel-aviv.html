<div class="hello"><div><p>Tel Aviv Marina offers a good range of services including fuel and water on the dock. There are two chandleries with a good selection close by and marine charts are also available locally. There are various workshops in the area, including haul-out by crane (20 tons). A whole range of repairs can be undertaken, such as engine, electronic, fibreglass or sail repair.</p>
<p>There is a small marina at Jaffa, situated close to Tel Aviv. The entrances to both Tel Aviv and Jaffa Marina are difficult and should not be used in strong onshore winds.</p>
