<li>This Polynesian kingdom, situated in the heart of the South Pacific, consists of over 160 coral and volcanic islands, of which only 36 are inhabited.</li>
<li>Best known among sailors is the northern group of Vava'u, whose maze of islets and reefs provides one of the best cruising grounds in the South Pacific. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of boats in the South Pacific, in particular in Tonga’s Vava’u Group, and facilities for yachts are improving all the time.</li>
<li><strong><i>Getting work done: </i></strong>In spite of Tonga's remoteness, facilities are surprisingly good and the setting up of a small industrial centre near the capital Nuku'alofa has encouraged several boating-related foreign companies to start operations in Tonga. There is also a Moorings charter <span>base in Vava’u</span>. In 2015, a new boatyard (the only one in Tonga) opened in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Tonga/Neiafu">Vava'u</a></strong> <span>capable of handling monohulls and multihulls up to 30 metric tonnes and 60ft.</span></li>
<li><strong><i>Provisioning:</i></strong> There are several supermarkets which stock local staples and produce and fresh produce markets. Be sure to arrive early.</li>
<li>A dangerous area to avoid by boats on passage to Fiji is Metis Shoal (19°11.4'S 174°51'W), where there has been intense volcanic activity.</li>
<li>The Ha’apai group, while requiring careful navigation, have some of the most beautiful isolated islands in the Pacific.</li>
<li><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cruisingworld.com/photos-tongas-new-island"><b>Tonga has a new </b><b>island,</b></a> about 65 kilometres south-west of Tongatapu, which started forming in January 2016 after a volcano began erupting. Tonga's lands and natural resources ministry has examined the island and stated that the newly formed landmass is around 800m wide and 1.3km long.</li>
