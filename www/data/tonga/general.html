<p><strong>Tonga-Samoa Handbook</strong><br/> By David Stanley<br/> Publisher: Avalon Travel Publishing; illustrated edition (6 Oct 1999)<br/> ISBN-13: 978-1566911740 <br/> Tonga-Samoa Handbook covers the two Samoas, Tonga, and Niue, a stimulating touring region now easily accessible on direct flights from Auckland, Honolulu, and Los Angeles. All four countries included in the guide are closely linked by air, and you can also get around much of the region by ferry. This book presents all the varied transportation, tour, and accommodation options at your disposal, letting you select those best suited to your budget or taste while avoiding expensive miscalculations. The main sporting activities here are outlined in detail: snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, sailing, and hiking. Tonga-Samoa Handbook grew out of my South Pacific Handbook, presently in its 7th edition. South Pacific was the first practical guide to Tonga and the Samoas, and for the many years it has been the only travel guide to Niue</p>
