<div><p>The Q flag must be flown. The captain should contact the Harbour Master or Customs on arrival (prior to docking/mooring), who will give instructions where to berth for clearing in and may or may not board the yacht. One must present the outward clearance from the last port.</p>
<p><span>You will be boarded by Immigration, Customs, Quarantine, and Health.</span></p>
<p><span>You must clear in and out of each island group if you plan to travel within Tonga – this is known as a domestic check in/check out and you will need a Local Movement Report (Small Craft) issued by customs for each island group. See each island group for details.</span></p>
<p>See the chosen Port of Entry for specific clearance information for that port.</p>
<p>In general in Tonga, clearance will take quite some time, so be patient and polite.</p>

<div><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016)</b> There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Tonga is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to the CDC’s dedicated website if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<div><p><b>Local Movement Report for cruising within Tonga</b></p>
<p><span>Day sailing within the island groups is not restricted, but a Local Movement Report (Small Craft) known locally as a ‘domestic check-in, check-out’ is required when moving between groups served by customs offices. </span></p>
<p><span>Any harbour dues should be paid prior to visiting customs, as the receipt needs to be shown to obtain the Local Movement Report. </span></p>
<p><span>On arrival at the next island group, one must contact customs on arrival. </span></p>
<p><span>When travelling between Nuku'alofa and Vava'u, or vice versa, one can request that the Local Movement Report includes Ha'apai if intending to stop in that island group.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div><p><i><b>Social Customs:</b></i> <br/>Anyone appearing in public without a shirt (and ladies covered from shoulder to below the knee) will risk being fined. <br/>Dress code is very strict, as is Sunday observance, when no work (even on your own boat), sporting or other strenuous activities are allowed. Neither should laundry be hung out to dry. <br/>Hats should never be worn either in church, or in the presence of a person in authority or someone to whom you wish to show respect. <br/>Displaying anger or frustration is considered very bad form in Tonga.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Swimming with whales is ILLEGAL from a private yacht!</p>
<p>Any swimming with whales is illegal UNLESS with a licenced operator. Fines are becoming larger and your Visa may be cancelled or your vessel could be detained. <span>This has happened and visas have been cancelled with a yacht having to leave immediately. Rather go with a professional who knows how to approach whales. Don’t let yachties get a bad reputation.</span></p>
<p>Don’t harass whales: a collision at sea WILL ruin your entire day!</p>
<p><b><i>Marine Reserves:</i> </b>There are some underwater sites of particular beauty and these have been designated as marine reserves. These reserves are for viewing only, collection of shells or marine life is prohibited and anchoring is not permitted near or in the giant clam reserves.</p>
<p>There are seven marine and coastal reserves around Tongatapu: Hakaumamato Reef, Pangaimotu Reef, Malinoa Island and Reef, Ha'atafu Beach, Monuafe Island and Reef, Mounu Reef Giant Clam Reserve (northwest of the yacht harbour) and Muihopohoponga Coastal Reserve on Niutoua.</p>
<p>Three reserves are proposed for Vava'u: the wreck of Clan McWilliam in Neiafu harbour, the coral gardens between Nuapapu and Vaketeitu, the Giant Clam Reserves in Hunga Lagoon, Neiafu Harbour and off Ano Beach. Giant clams are an endangered species and those tagged with a number printed on the shell or an aluminium tag should not be disturbed even outside of the reserves. Visitors are requested to show restraint in collecting other shells, by taking dead shells or buying them and limiting the number taken to one or two of each species. Over-collection of Triton shells has led to an increase in crown of thorns starfish which in abundance can destroy the reef; and visitors are urged not to buy or collect tritons.</p>
<p><i><strong>Waste Disposal:</strong> </i>Throwing rubbish into the harbour or waters of Tonga is forbidden. As there are no refuse containers on the out islands, visitors are expected to carry all rubbish with them on board and dispose of it in one of the refuse containers in Faua harbour, on the wharf at Neiafu, or at the Moorings Base.</p>
