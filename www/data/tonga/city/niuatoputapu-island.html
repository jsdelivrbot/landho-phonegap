<div class="hello"><div><p>This small island lying some 175 miles north of the main Tongan island group is a convenient port of entry into the Kingdom of Tonga for yachts arriving from the north.</p>
<p>Niuatoputapu Island suffered extensive damage following the 2009 Samoa earthquake and subsequent Tsunami. Approximately 192 families were left homeless. Visiting Cruisers can help greatly with clothing and bedding donations.</p>
<p>A small pass on the NW side of the island with a minimum depth of 12 ft leads through the reef. It is essential to line up the marks as the pass is very narrow. More markers lead to the anchorage area off the wharf.</p>
<p>Location 15°55'29"S<span>, 173°45'40"W (entrance to the pass)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival contact the local authorities for clearance. </p>
<p>Except for the plant quarantine officer (located in the village at the anchorage), the other three officials (Customs, Immigration &amp; Health) are located in the 3rd village (about 1 hour walking or 15 min biking). Often, someone will inform them of your arrival and a white van may honk at you from the dock. You need to transport them to/from your yacht.</p>
