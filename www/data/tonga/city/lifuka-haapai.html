<p>Lifuka is the capital of Ha'apai group of islands and is on the island of Pangai. Of the many small islands in this group, only about 15 to 20 are inhabited.</p>
<p>Location 19°48'09"S, 174°21′11"W.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Islands in the Ha'apai group</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ha'ano Island</strong><br/> This island is about 8 miles north of Lifuka.</p>
<p>Location 19° 40′ 26.4″ S, 174° 16′ 40.8″ W.</p>
<p><strong>Uoleva Island<br/></strong><span>Just 5 miles south of Pangai with a large bay and long sandy beach providing excellent shelter against prevailing trade winds. Newly opened in 2014 is Uovela Yacht club run by Craig Airey and Kristen Duirs located in the middle of the bay. A welcoming place for yachties including cruiser information for Ha’api/Tongatapu. More details below.</span></p>
<p>Location 19° 50′ 56″ S, 174° 24′ 16″ W.</p>
<p><strong><i><img class="image-right" src="resolveuid/18fb63d97763444cb06ce17785c554fd/@@images/image/mini"/></i>Kelefesia</strong><br/> Kelefesia is the southern most island in the Ha'apai group, and it is only 35 miles north of Nuku'alofa <i>(see photo right courtesy of SY Adina)</i>. It is a dramatically beautiful island. These combined characteristics make it an ideal stop between the Ha'apai and Tongatapu groups. The tiny anchorage at Kelefesia cannot handle more than three boats at any one time and is also prone to being very rolly. The island is privately owned, but they welcome boaters to anchor here year-round and to land on the shore.</p>
<p>Location 20° 30' 00" S, 174° 44' 00" W.</p>
<p><strong>Ha'afeva</strong><br/> A very small island which is keen to encourage visitors. It is located 30nm southwest of Pangai.</p>
<p>Location 20° 2′ 30.12″ S, 174° 39′ 21.6″ W.</p>

<p>If you stop anywhere in Foa, Lifuka or Uolanga, you are requested to check in. If you come from Vava'u or Nuku'Alofa, you only need to show your <i><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Tonga?rc=Formalities#Documents">Local Movement Report (Small Craft)</a></strong>.</i> If you are intending to explore the Ha’aipi Islands request a domestic check-in and out as a trip back to check out can incur some significant mileage and in 2014 Customs were happy to do this.
