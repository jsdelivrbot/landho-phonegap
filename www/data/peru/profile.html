<div><ul>
<li>With its Inca ruins, old Spanish colonial cities and the magnificent Andes dominating the centre of the country, Peru has always been one of the most fascinating countries to visit in South America.</li>
<li>In the last few years the activity of guerrilla groups, whose attacks in various parts of the country have affected foreign tourists as well as Peruvians, has made Peru much less of an attractive destination.</li>
<li>Even before this, Peru was a difficult cruising destination, as there are few ports along its arid coast on the Pacific Ocean. The few yachts that call normally make their base at Callao, where the yacht club is a secure place to leave the boat while touring the interior of this intriguing country.</li>
<li>Note: Formalities in Peru are very expensive.</li>

<div><p>Due to the general poverty here, theft, pickpocketing and bag snatching are generally the crimes to be aware of. Distraction theft being a common technique.</p>
<p>A high number of robberies have been reported. Paita is a particularly dangerous port. The use or purchase of drugs is severely punished and can lead to 15 years' imprisonment. There have been reports of the planting of drugs on foreigners by police followed by demands for high sums of money for the charges to be dropped. Guerilla activities still continue, and police and army searches are common.</p>
<p>Political protests can close even main highways for days, even weeks at a time.</p>
<p>If planning a wilderness trip, go with a group and take advice on the safe areas in which to hike.</p>

<div><p>The climate of coastal Peru is greatly influenced by the cold Humboldt current, which keeps temperatures cool throughout the year and often produces coastal fog. There is very little rain along the coast which is arid and desert-like. The prevailing winds are south or southeasterly and usually light.</p>
