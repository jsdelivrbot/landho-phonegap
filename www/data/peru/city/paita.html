<p><b>Due to the high crime rate here, this is not a recommended port of call. If however you have to stop here due to emergency, be sure clear all items from deck, including life raft, life buoys, boathooks, sail sheets, anchors not in use. Hoist the dinghy and secure with lock and chain. If possible, maintain a 24-hour deck watch.</b></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Finding space to anchor among the hundreds of fishing boats in this anchorage might be a little difficult.</p>
<p>Due to these same fishing boats, the state of the harbour is very unpleasant. Take great care when anchoring as much of the bottom is foul.</p>
