<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Peru?rc=Formalities">Peru Formalities</a></strong> page for full details on clearing into Peru. Also note the comments at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>It is advisable to contact Yacht Club Peruano in advance for help and advice.  Advise YCP of your expected arrival before leaving your previous port. Advise again 72 hours before arrival so they can organise an agent and make the appropriate appointments for your clearance. Alternatively inform them of the agent you are using for clearance.</p>
<p>Once at the yacht club, contact YCP on Channel 68. They answer to "La Punta" (Yacht club office hours are 9am-6pm). No English is spoken. They will assign you a mooring and arrange check-in for you. Avoid arriving on the weekend to keep overtime costs down. Remain on the boat until you have received official clearance to leave.</p>
<p><span>There are four offices to visit; Health Department (Sanidad Maritima), National Port Authority (civilian), Port Captain (Navy),  Immigration. and Customs (although this is not supposed to be required for pleasure yachts).</span></p>
<p>Shore passes will be issued, but these are not valid for travel outside Callao and Lima, so a proper visa should be requested if intending to travel inland.</p>
<p>Cruisers have reported that it can take more than a few days to complete clearance here, depending on the agent used (see reports adjacent).</p>
<p>On clearing out, Port Authority, Port Captain and Immigration must be visited. There will be an agency charge (negotiable) and a fee for the exit Zarpe.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The moorings here are a little rolly, but the area is safe and the people are reported to be friendly. It is advisable to check the mooring buoy for strength.</p>
<p>That yacht club has recently been remodelled and now has a new restaurant and showers.</p>
