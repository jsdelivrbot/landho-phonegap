                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><strong>Clearing into Peru is very expensive. See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Peru?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a> for more details.</strong></p>
<p><i>See comments from cruisers at the bottom of the page about how complicated, time consuming and expensive clearance is here.</i></p>
<p>Boats that have entered territorial waters (both Peru and Chile insist on 200 miles), must proceed directly to an official port of entry.</p>
<p>The authorities must be advised in advance of a vessel's arrival. Call TRAMAR (Transportes Maritima) on VHF Channel 16, day or night, as soon as you are within 20 miles of the intended port of entry to announce that you have entered into their jurisdiction and to ask permission to proceed into the harbour.</p>
<p>Instructions will be given at that time. All communications with TRAMAR are in English. They will ask you the name of your agent, who are supposed to take care of your arrival and do all the paperwork.</p>
<p>Clearing in at Callao has now been much simplified for pleasure yachts due to work done by the Yacht Club Peruano, who can organise an agent (see Clearance Agents below). Go to <a href="Countries/Peru/LaPuntaCallao%28Lima%29"><strong>Callao</strong></a> for more information.</p>
<p>Clearing in at any other port has been reported to be almost impossible.</p>
<p>Avoid arriving on the weekend to keep overtime costs down. Remain on the boat until you have received official clearance to leave.</p>
<p>It is necessary to employ an agent.</p>
<p>There are four offices to visit; Health Department (Sanidad Maritima), National Port Authority (civilian), Port Captain (Navy),  Immigration. and Customs (although this is not supposed to be required for pleasure yachts).</p>
<p>It is important to ensure you have a Health Booklet. You will be fined if you do not.</p>
<p>Shore passes will be issued, however a proper visa should be requested if intending to travel inland.</p>
<p>On clearing out, Port Authority, Port Captain and Immigration must be visited. There will be a charge for the exit Zarpe.</p>
<p><strong>En-Route Reporting Requirements - Twice Daily</strong></p>
<p>These change frequently, but the latest information is as follows:-</p>
<p>Position reports (PR) are required twice daily at 08:00 and 20:00 and may be sent via radio or e-mail (you will probably not get an answer).</p>
<p>Additionally, a report must be sent:-<br/> 1) upon entering Peruvian waters (EPW)<br/> 2) documenting any stoppage at sea (DR)<br/> 3) a final report one hour before arrival at final destination (FR).</p>
<p>The yacht should retain a log of reports sent as there is a stiff fine for non-compliance. All reports may be in English. The report should be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:costeracallao@marina.mil.pe">costeracallao@marina.mil.pe</a> or if no on-board email is available, radio the closest port with the information.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months on entry.</p>
<p>No visa is required for citizens of Western Europe, Asia, North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa.</p>
<p>Travellers from Fiji and India do need visas.</p>
<p>The crew of foreign yachts who wish to visit the interior should insist on being given a tourist card on arrival, particularly if intending to leave Peru for one of the neighbouring countries before returning to the yacht.</p>
<p>Visas or tourist cards cannot now be extended. If wishing to stay longer than 90 days, request a 183 day visa/tourist card on entry.</p>
<p>Some identification should always be carried, either passports or a photocopy that has been witnessed by a notary.</p>
<p>Ensure your passport is stamped on entry.</p>

<p>If visiting the interior, yellow fever inoculation and malaria prophylaxis are recommended.</p>
<p>Cholera, Hepatitis A and Dengue fever are also prevalent and sensible precautions should be taken.</p>
<p>If travelling to Machu Picchu, Puno or Lake Titicaca, take altitude sickness seriously and follow local advice on the appropriate remedies.</p>
<p>Tap water in Peru is not safe to drink.</p>
<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Peru is an area of interest due to mosquito transmission risk. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
