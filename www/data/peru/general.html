<p>Outside Lima and Cuzco, changing travellers cheques is difficult.</p>
<p>ATMs distribute primarily $100solas - a unit which most stores are hesitant to take for both fear of counterfeiting and the fact that they rarely carry enough small change. Take the notes to a bank and get them chaged into $10 and $5 solas.</p>
<p>Many ATMs dispense both local currency (nuevos soles) and US dollars.</p>
<p>Credit cards attract a significant surcharge.</p>

10/06/2015 CP checked Publication
