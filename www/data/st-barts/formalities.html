<div><p>Clear in at Gustavia at the Port Captain's office. Immigration is also dealt with here.</p>
<p><span>When going from the French side of St. Martin to St. Barts, no outgoing clearance is necessary (the St. Martin clearance software doesn't even have an entry for St. Barts as a destination) or possible. Boats must clear in to St. Barts as normal, but this is more a way for them to control boat traffic. </span></p>
<p><span>When leaving St. Barts an outgoing clearance is always necessary, even when departing for St. Martin.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Saint Barts is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

            </h2>
<div><p>Cats and dogs may be admitted temporarily with a certificate of good health issued not more than 5 days prior to arrival on the island, and proof of an anti-rabies vaccination given at least 30 days (but not more than 12 months) prior to arrival. Documents must be issued by a licensed veterinarian. Dogs are now required to be micro-chipped for entry.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You may find that officials do not ask to see any documentation for your pet. However cruisers who have visited the French Islands with pets advise the following:</p>
<p>Make sure your dog's vaccinations and rabies documentation are current, get an International Health Certificate from your local vet prior to traveling, have an international microchip and keep invoices for products such as flea/tick/heartworm treatments. It is quite possible the officials in the French Islands will not question you or care about your pet. However, if they do, you can have a local vet provide the documentation required if something is missing from your records.</p>
