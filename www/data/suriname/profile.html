<ul>
<li>Suriname <span>is a country on the NE </span>Atlantic<span> coast of South America. </span>It is bordered<span> by </span>French Guiana<span> to the east, </span>Guyana<span> to the west and </span>Brazil<span> to the south. <span>A member of </span>CARICOM<span>, it is considered to be a culturally </span>Caribbean<span> country.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suriname is a worthwhile place to stop when en route to the Caribbean from either Europe, Africa or Brazil, as well as an alternative place to spend hurricane season.</li>
<li>In 2016 however Suriname is suffering an economic crisis and prices for services have doubled. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suriname has a flat coast, where most of the population live. Uplands rise up from the coastal plain and contain mineral reserves, while the coast is indented with six rivers. Some of the wide rivers are navigable for a considerable distance inland. See <a href="Countries/Suriname?rc=GeneralInfo#Publications"><strong>Publications</strong></a> page for a very useful cruising pilot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Suriname River is the place to enter the country as both Paramaribo (the capital) and Domburg lie on this river. </li>
<li>Travel in the the country is generally trouble-free, and exploring the unspoiled interior is a major reason for visiting this friendly country.</li>
<li>This is a multi-cultural country made up of <span>Amerindians (the only original inhabitants), Maroons, Indians, Creoles, Indonesians, <span>Dutch, Libanese, a Jewish community, and Chinese. <span>Dutch and Sranang-Tongo, (a mixed language of all) are mostly spoken, however English is understood everywhere.</span></span></span></li>
<li>Tourism is well developed in Suriname, and Domburg has become quite a haven for yachts waiting out the hurricane season. Facilities and services for yachts in Domburg have improved greatly in recent years, however since the new Government further development does not appear to be happening.</li>

<div><p><span>Currently (August 2014) fishermen in and around the </span><span>Corentyne River (which is the border between Guyana and Suriname) are being violently attacked by pirates and losing anchors and fishing gear. This area should be avoided.</span></p>
<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>) gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have information about a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>
