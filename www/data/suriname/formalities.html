            </h2>
<div><p><span>Enter Suriname through the Suriname river as both </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/Suriname/Paramaribo"><strong>Paramaribo</strong></a><span> and </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/Suriname/Domburg"><strong>Domburg</strong></a><span> (upstream) lie on this river.</span></p>
<p>Enter preferably during daylight, as it can be confusing during the night with the numerous lights.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a dangerous wreck at the entrance which was reported May 2016. <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Suriname/Paramaribo/port_view#1462969749409133">See details here</a></b>.</p>
<p>Fly <span>the 'Q' flag, lower the sails and motor in with the tide.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If waiting for daylight and/or the tide, you can safely anchor at the river mouth, OUT of the shipping lane in 5m of water, and wait.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Whilst all formalities must be completed in the city of </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/Suriname/Paramaribo"><strong>Paramaribo</strong></a><span>, a new government rule does not allow yachts to anchor near the town (unless special permission has been granted), so all visiting yachts must proceed directly up stream to </span><span> </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/Suriname/Domburg">Domburg</a> </strong><span>and travel to Paramaribo from there (only 10nm away). </span></p>
<p><span>Approx. 8 miles in, call MAS (Maritime Authority Suriname) on VHF channel 12 or 16, to advise them of your arrival. </span><span>If nothing heard just proceed to Domburg, past the </span><span>bridge over the river (height 90 mtr).</span></p>
<p><span>Clearance is not required immediately. Once settled in at Domburg, the skipper and crew should attend to clearance formalities in Paramaribo, easily reached by a direct bus link from Domburg. </span><span>See </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Suriname?rc=GeneralInfo#Transport"><strong>transport</strong></a><span> for details on buses between Domburg and Paramaribo.</span></p>
<p>The skipper and all crew must attend all offices for clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is sensible to dress reasonably smartly as cruisers have been refused access to the Foreign Police office because they were wearing shorts. Being polite and always <span>greeting an official or person before asking a question will serve you well.</span></p>
<p><strong>Clearing In from Domburg</strong></p>
<p>The day before you plan to head into Paramaribo to clear in, go to Domburg internet shop and make 3 copies of your crew list. Remember, all crew (with their passports) must complete clearance.</p>
<p>Minibuses into town run from 6am to 4pm and it is strongly advised to start early (around 7am). The bus ends up at the Heiligenweg bus stop. Whilst it is possible to take buses to the various offices (see cruiser's <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Suriname/useful-pilotage-notes-for-a-visit-to-domburg-and-a-trip-up-river">report</a></strong> ), it is much simpler to take a taxi from Heiligenweg bus stop to all the various offices you need to visit. Arrange a set price for two hours (cost approx. <span>SDR 40/hour)</span>.</p>
<p><span>Arriving yachts must first check in with the Foreigners Police (Vreemdelingen Politie (VP)), located on </span><span>Jaggernath Lachmon street # 167. <span>Go around the right side of the building into the VP office, the officer who deals with the yacht arrivals is in a separate office on the left. </span>Here you will get your first stamp on your crew lists and one will be kept by the official.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, to the Immigration Office </span><span>on the corner of Lim A Po and Watermolenstreet to</span><span> obtain a tourist pass. </span><span>They will keep one of the stamped crew lists as well. Pay at the office directly for a tourist pass, </span><span>no passport photos needed.</span></p>
<p>If however you require a visa, <span>you will need to go and pay for this at the bank and bring the receipt back to </span><span>the Immigration office before the visa will be issued.</span></p>
<p>Lastly, return to the VP who will stamp your passports, you keep the other crew list.</p>
<p><span>You will need to check in with the VP every thirty days of your stay. They will give you a free extension stamp with a maximum stay of 3 months permitted on a tourist visa.</span></p>
<p><strong>Clearing Out</strong></p>
<p>When leaving the country, just an exit stamp on your crew list is needed at the foreign Police (vreemdelingen polite).</p>
<p><span>Cruisers have reported; "They will ask you when you are leaving. It cannot be further away than "tomorrow" otherwise they will tell you to come back. In practice nobody checks to see that you have actually left".</span></p>

<div><p>All passports must be valid for at least 6 months from arrival.</p>
<p><span>There is no need for a visa in advance, a stamp on your crew list and passport, and a tourist pass is obtained on arrival which allows you a stay of three months.</span></p>
<p>The following nationalities can now purchase a tourist card (visa) on arrival which is valid for three months (see Fees below):<br/>Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Netherlands, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, USA, Venezuela.</p>
<p>Even though the visa is valid for 3 months, you still have to visit the <span>"vreemdelingen politie" every month to get your visa stamped.</span></p>
<p><span>Nationalities not on the above list will require a visa. This can be obtained on arrival, however does require payment at the bank </span><span>and the receipt brought back to </span><span>the Foreign Affairs office before the visa will be issued.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If in St Laurent, French Guiana before coming to Suriname, it's possible to get a<span> Tourist Pass for Suriname there (at the Suriname office) which eliminates having to do it here. This makes things easier with just one stop at MAS, and one stop at the Military Police required.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Suriname is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p>
