<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/HarbourResortDomburgMoorings.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>This small village lies about 6 miles up river from Paramaribo and is where most cruisers stay after clearing in.</p>
<p>Facilities for yachts improved greatly here during 2013, with new moorings (part of Harbour Resort Domburg - see photo) installed off the village in the river, new services ashore plus a marina further upstream. Sadly however it appears that over the last 12 months no further investment has been made and facilities are falling into disrepair somewhat.</p>
<p>At weekends, the normally sleepy Domburg livens up a little with many locals<span> enjoying the water</span><span>front, eating out in the many small restaurants.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Suriname?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Suriname Clearance</strong></a> page for full details of how to complete clearance from Domburg.</p>
<p>Paramaribo can be reached by bus from Domburg,  mornings only (approx. SDR 2.50). Start the process early in the morning as it can take up to 4 hours to complete all the stages and all government offices close at 14:00.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take note of the tides in the river. See <a href="Members/sue/R2010-10-07-6"><strong>Pilotage &amp; Local Info</strong></a> for advice on timing.</p>
<p><span>The best anchorage is off the village in about 10m, but allow plenty of scope and swinging room. Take care as this anchorage is reported to be littered with debris (nets, ropes and small logs). The dinghy can be left at the wooden steps in the stone wall or at the excellent new floating dinghy pontoon at Harbour Resort Domburg.</span></p>
<p>The jetty is only for the use of ferries and official boats.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/copy_of_HarbourResortDomburgAshore.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/>Harbour Resort Domburg started operating late 2013 (see photos right and above). This offers visiting yachts moorings (brand new in September 2013), a dinghy dock, a restaurant, laundry, WiFi, swimming pool, plus a number of other services. See their listing below.</p>
<p>Within 3<span>00m of the dinghy dock you can find 3 supermarkets, a doctor, a bank with ATM, a fuel station, hairdresser, engine repair, police station and several churches.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The whole Harbour area is a protected area and has a good security.</span></span></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/WaterlandMarina_Dec13.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Upriver from Domburg, a small new marina, part of the Waterland resort, opened in December 2012. The marina is in a fairly isolated area, however it is very easy to rent a car close to the resort for approx. Eu 12 per day. Some new shops have also opened near the resort.</p>
