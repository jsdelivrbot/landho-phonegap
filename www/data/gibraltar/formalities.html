<p>Firearms must be declared on arrival. Guns are impounded and kept until departure.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Other prohibited items also include flick knives, gravity knives, controlled drugs, explosives, ivory etc.</span></p>
<p>Any items which yachts wish to import duty free must be reported to Customs on arrival.</p>
<p>If sending items out of Gibraltar for repair, Customs must inspect them first and be informed of the details. Incoming equipment must be clearly marked "yacht spares in transit to . . ." For a useful report on shipping spares to Gibraltar, see <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2012-02-13-3">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>There is no VAT payable on yachts purchased in Gibraltar. Yachts kept in Gibraltar for more than six months are subject to an import duty of 12%. Yachts purchased in Gibraltar by non-Gibraltarian persons and companies and taken away from Gibraltar within a six month period are exempt from import duty. However, yachts can be left unaccompanied in Gibraltar for a longer period without paying duty, with the permission of Customs, who will place the vessel under bond.</p>
<p>Gibraltar is part of the European Union but outside the VAT area. This means that yachts remaining here will not be eligible for VAT, but if a yacht continues on to a VAT area of the EU, such as France or Spain, Customs should officially consider their 18 month VAT-free temporary importation to have commenced on arrival in Gibraltar. However, it is worth noting <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Gibraltar/view#1452788883942131"><b>this comment</b></a> on how things are regarded in practice.</p>
<p>Note: Yachts purchased by Gibraltarian registered companies are not subject to VAT when berthing in EU ports.</p>
<p>To register a yacht in Gibraltar is relatively straightforward, for more details contact the Gibraltar Ship &amp; Yacht Registry 812 Europort, Gibraltar, Tel: +353 200 73343, Fax: +353 200 77044.</p>

<div><p>Tuna nets are a hazard, especially in the spring and summer, as they are laid along the Spanish coast in the approaches to the Straits of Gibraltar, sometimes several miles offshore. Normally the nets have one or more fishing boats in attendance. The vessel on the seaward end of the net should fly a black flag with <code>A</code> on it by day, and two red lights, or red and white lights on each mast by night. Yachts should pass to seaward of the nets, which often extend 2-3 miles outwards, and float just below the surface. Yachts should not attempt to go between the inner marks and the shore.</p>
