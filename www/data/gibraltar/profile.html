<div><ul>
<li>Yachts from all parts of the globe call at Gibraltar every year and the facilities at their disposal are some of the best in the area. The movement of yachts is virtually continuous, although there are clearly defined peak periods. Spring and early summer sees boats arriving from across the Atlantic or Northern Europe bound for the Mediterranean. The autumn months see a large movement in the opposite direction as many cruising yachts leave the Mediterranean, usually bound for Madeira and the Canaries en route to the Caribbean. </li>
<li>Yachting facilities are pressed at peak periods, however the new Ocean Village Marina in Gib and new marina at La Linea just across the border should hopefully ease the situation. It is advisable during peak periods, to go armed with a confirmed pre-booking, as yachts have reported being turned away.</li>
<li>Although a convenient place for repairs and reprovisioning, Gibraltar is also a good place to relax and its cosmopolitan makeup serves this function well.</li>
<li>Whales may be encountered in the Straits of Gibraltar from April to August. To minimise risk of collision, advised speed limit is 13 knots and keep a good lookout.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If heading into Spain from Gib, be sure to top up your tanks before departure as diesel is cheaper in Gib. Note also that diesel is even cheaper in Morocco.</li>

<div><p>The tall rock attracts its own weather, often being covered by low cloud. Such mist is often a sign that the Levanter, a strong easterly wind, is on its way. Usually caused by an approaching Atlantic low, the latter can reach gale force rapidly, lasting for several days. About 80 per cent of the winds blow either from the east or west. Poniente is the name of the westerly wind, which is also preceded by low cloud. With the Atlantic Ocean so near, Gibraltar's weather is not entirely Mediterranean. However, it is generally a pleasant climate with warm summers and mild winters.</p>
