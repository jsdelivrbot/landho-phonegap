<div class="hello"><div><p>The Rock of Gibraltar is a 1400 ft high giant slab of jagged Jurassic limestone formed around 200 million years ago, and dominates a unique geographical position connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Gibraltar itself is a land mass of some three miles in length, and one mile wide, overlooking the twenty-mile stretch of water known as the Straits which divides the two continents of Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The separating line between Gibraltar and Spain is a half-mile wide isthmus, which doubles as an international airport runway, along with the local traffic and pedestrians. It must be one of the few places, if not the only place, in the world where you get off the plane and walk across the runway you have just landed on to get to your destination.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The daytime approach to Gibraltar is straightforward. At night, entry into Gibraltar Bay can be more difficult<span> </span><span>but navigation lights at the entrances to all harbour areas are available and </span><span>marked on UK Admiralty charts BA 1448, BA144 and BA45.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The Port Authority has a yacht refuelling facility on the Western Arm at 1E berth which operates </span><span>during daylight hours, but the main refuelling berth is at Marina Bay/Ocean Village Marina (see </span><span>below).</span></p>
<p>There are docking facilities at Queensway Quay Marina, Ocean Village Marina and Marina Bay. The last two now administered as one.</p>
<p>Entrance to these marinas is the south side of the airport runway <span>marked with red channel </span><span>buoys which must be used at all times.</span><span> Follow the runway along, the office is straight ahead - white two storey building. Entrance into Marina Bay is on the left (keep following red channel buoys), Ocean Village berths are either straight ahead or slightly to the right. Contact marina when coming down the runway and they will allocate a berth and assist with tie up.</span></p>
<p>Ocean Village has floating docks with one finger, (but with med moor bow/stern lines) the fingers are very flimsy and do not have cleats on them. Marina Bay has med moorings with very high concrete piers.</p>
<p>The entrance to Queensway Quay marina has been moved to the northern end of the breakwater. All marinas offer reduced winter rates.</p>
<p>The shortage of berthing for yachts in Gibraltar itself is an ongoing problem, but a <span>new 700 berth marina is now under construction, due to open in 2016.</span></p>
<p>The marina previously known as Sheppard's was sold for the development of the Ocean Village Marina Complex. Sheppard's chandlery continues to operate from the same site, but the boatyard repair facilities have been moved to Coaling Island.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Anchoring off La Linea is now forbidden.</p>
<p>Dinghy thefts are frequent, s be sure to lift the dinghy out of the water at night and lock it.</p>

      Full service marina. Code required to access pontoons. 120 berths. Metred water &amp; electricity to pontoons. No repair facilities. Laundry service. Clearance facilities.
The marina is peaceful because it is furthest from the airport, but there is an unlit floating boom across the entrance between 2100 hours to 0830 hours. Cruisers recommend the "Landings Restaurant" as very cruiser-friendly.
