<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is close to the western border of Brunei. It is the second largest town in Brunei and is situated at the mouth of the Belait River.</p>
<p>There is a bar off the entrace to the port with a dredged channel through it. This is well buoyed however is not frequently dredged. Cruisers reported the following depths in August 2010: A least depth of 0.7 metres over the bar at low water. A least depth of 2.1 metres over the bar at high water.</p>
<p>Position 04° 36.2’N, 114°10.3’E (port entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Prior to entry, when off the breakwaters at Kuala Belait call Belait Port Control on Ch 15 and request entry. At the same time ask the Port Official about available depth over the bar. </p>
<p>If arriving out of hours you can anchor in the South West corner of the quarantine anchorage. Keep a sharp lookout for Oil Industry Support vessels returning to Port here as dusk approaches and the car ferry. Note that the flare that helps mark the entrance, and is mentioned in the pilot book, may not currently be lit.</p>
<p>Once anchored or moored you can take the dinghy to the Kuala Belait Boat Club and walk into town. </p>
<p>All the necessary offices are in the large multi-storey building on the waterfront (Marine Services Building). Go left on the ground floor for Port Clearance and you will be directed from there.</p>
<p>When checking in ask for your departure paperwork to fill out ahead of time. When checking out with Customs and Immigration you will need to return to the Marine Department and the Port Department to deliver copies of your clearance papers. Also, Customs will want a Cargo Manifest which can just say "nil".</p>
<p>The staff are friendly and helpful.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Entrance is narrow but straightforward as this is an oil support base, <b>but</b> be very aware of the number of support vessels returning late in the evening - they are unlikely to take any notice of a yacht! </p>
<p>The best anchorage is opposite the main marine services building and
the small boat jetty in town, in about 5 M over mud. Anchoring is prohibited in certain areas – usually signed – because of submarine pipelines.</p>
<p>Beware of large floating <code>islands</code> of vegetaion as well as logs being swept along by the tide.</p>
<p>If unable to enter this port, a possible alternative overnight anchorage could be just inside the private marina at Jerudong (approx. 04°57’.6 N, 114°48’.5 E). It is very sheltered and the holding is good in mud, <b>but</b> you could be asked to move on as it is private.</p>
