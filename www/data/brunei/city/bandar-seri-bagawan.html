<div class="hello"><div><p>It is possible to take your yacht right up into Bandar Seri Begawan, just keep to the marked channel. It is not a particlarly comfortable anchorage due to the amount of traffic on the water causing a constant chop but it is very convenient for the town. Hail a taxi to take you ashore (but it is advisable to leave someone on board).</p>
<p>Anchor fore and aft (to keep clear of the channel) just NE of the sta'bd lateral mark, close to the shore. The holding, in mud can be uncertain due to the 2kn current. This position is just 20-50m from the RBYC Club's floating jetty.</p>
<p>The RBYC also has another clubhouse at <a href="Countries/Brunei/Muara"><strong>Muara</strong></a> (at 04°53.85'N, 114°59.26'S). Here there is a dinghy dock, showers, restaurant and WiFi.</p>
