<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on the extreme eastern tip of the land forming the northern shore of Brunei Bay, Muara is an important port for Brunei being its only deep-water one. It is also well-known for its long, fine, white sandy beach.</p>
<p>Position 5° 0.52' N, 115° 04.1'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port control should be contacted on VHF Channel 16.</p>
<p>If arriving in the evening it is OK to report in next morning.</p>
<p><span>The easiest way to check in is to anchor off the Serasa Ferry Terminal </span><span>(5°0.9' N 115°03.8'E) </span><span>on the way in, then move to the yacht club once checked in. It's a long dinghy ride from the yacht club with a slow dinghy!</span></p>
<p>Tie the tender to to the  small landing inside the ferry terminal, about half way down the central covered walkway. The Port Authorities are just round the second turning, at the end of the walkway. After having completed all the clearing in procedures, to get back to your tender, enter the departure lounge, walk through (after having you newly issued visa checked), down the covered walkway to the extreme end, back on your self until adjacent to the tender landing area.</p>
<p>You may also have to check in with quarantine but this is not always required.</p>
<p>The ferry terminal is open from 07:00 to 18:00.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is important to keep to the marked channel because of the training walls which extend some way out from the entrance. There can be a current of up to 1.5 knots in or out of the river as well as a cross current where the training wall rises above sealevel.</p>
<p>Yachts can anchor past the pier, close to the Royal Brunei Yacht Club which is a little way up the river on the starboard side at approx 5°0.1'N 115°04.0'E. The RBYC anchorage is good holding in mostly mud. Don't come closer in than the moored yachts as it gets shallow fast.</p>
<p><span>There are no longer any free moorings here, and the locals will get upset if you grab their mooring while they are out sailing for the day.</span></p>

      The club has two clubhouses; one at Muara (Serasa) and one further up the river at Bandar Seri Begawan. <br>
You will receive a warm welcome at either location. <br>
At Serasa, make sure you anchor clear of the channel where all the local powerboats come in to the ramp, and also outside the moored yachts as it is very shallow further in. The moorings are all private and owned by yacht club members - it may be possible to hire/borrow or otherwise use one by arrangement.<br>
Introduce yourself at the bar. Visiting yachts can buy a temporary membership card for 35RM per week, or 5RM per day. <br>
Crews can buy meals, tender service and other items at RBYC by pre-purchasing coupons. It is a secure place to leave the yacht. For any repairs it is worth asking the advice of  the Yacht Club. The Club has recently upgraded its facilities for members and visiting yachts: free Wi-Fi connection, free use of an automatic washing machine, showers, swimming pool, and small workshop facility. Good meals can be had here at very reasonable prices.
