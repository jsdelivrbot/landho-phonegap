<div><p>Whilst Kuala Belait may be the closest Port of Entry into Brunei if coming from Malaysia, the depth over the bar at the entrance to the port is limited and therefore will not be available to all yachts.</p>
<p>Port Control should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 on approach. The normal procedure is to visit the Port Authority Office first, followed by Immigration, then Customs.</p>
<p>The Port Authority will want to see your previous port clearance etc. You will need to fill in arrival documents and give a copy of your crew list. The officer will tell you how much your light dues will be upon leaving, and will give you the outward clearance documents for completion prior to clearing out.</p>
<p>Customs will want a Cargo Manifest, which can just say "nil", and a crew list.</p>

<div><p><span>Passports must have a validity of at least 6 months.</span></p>
<p>Citizens of most countries will be granted a visa on arrival for periods of between 14 and 90 days. See <a href="http://www.mofat.gov.bn/Pages/Visa-Information.aspx"><strong>Brunei Government website</strong></a> for a detailed list.</p>
<p>Nationals of Australia are now granted a visa on arrival for a period of 30 days, as are those of New Zealand. Citizens of the European Union are granted 90 days as are those of the USA, but Canadians only have 14 days.</p>
<p>All foreign nationals will require a visa if they plan to stay longer that that which granted by their Visa On Arrival.</p>
<p>Proof of sufficient funds may be required.</p>
<p>Nationalities requiring a visa in advance, can obtain one from Brunei or British consulates.</p>
<p>Nationals from countries requiring a visa and arriving without one will receive a 72 hour Transit Pass. A transit pass requires that you are moving from one place to another via Brunei. A Transit Pass will not be issued if you intend returning to the place you arrived from.</p>
<p>It is possible to apply for a Visitor's Pass or Transit Pass extension at Brunei Immigration once admitted to Brunei.</p>
<p>Nationals from Israel, Egypt, Iran, Russia, Pakinstan, Myanmar, Tajikistan and Ukraine are not normally granted a Visa for Brunei.</p>

<div><p>Brunei Customs Authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import or export of items such as firearms, religious materials and alcohol.</p>
<p>Firearms should be declared to customs or police.</p>
<p>Alcohol must be declared to customs on arrival. A non Muslim over 17 years of age may bring in not more than two  bottles of liquor (about 2 litres) and twelve cans of beer for personal consumption. There are no alcohol sales or outlets in Brunei. Be sure to fill in the yellow import forms and keep them.</p>
<p>Consumption of alcohol in private, on one's yacht, at a private home or party, in a hotel room etc, is acceptable; but one should not make a display of it on public streets. Alcohol can also be taken to the Yacht Clubs for your own consumption there.</p>

<div><p>Brunei is officially a Muslim country. The version of Islam practiced in Brunei is open, family oriented, respectful of alternate religions, and tolerant of international pluralism. Brunei is a modern country with an international outlook. One should however observe local customs and religious practices by not accentuating or abusing the differences between Moslem and non Moslem practices, dress etc.</p>
<p>Alcohol must not be consumed in public. Smoking is discouraged.</p>
<p>Moslems in Brunei dress conservatively, and many Moslem women wear a head scarf in public, at government offices etc. Non-Moslem women are not required to wear a head scarf or big baggy clothes.</p>
<p>Shopping centres and public places reflect the multi-ethnic and international perspective of Brunei. It is rare to see Moslem men in shorts. Moslem women wear brightly coloured outfits that cover most skin, and probably a head scarf. Many people will be in short and/or tight skirts, jeans and the usual clothing that follows international fashion trends.</p>
<p>When visiting government offices for immigration, customs etc, conservative dress is respectful. Loose fitting long pants and shirts for men or long skirts/pants for women is the standard.</p></div>
