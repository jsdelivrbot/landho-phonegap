<p><strong>Mediterranean Cruising</strong><br/> By Rod Heikell<br/> Published by Adlard Coles Nautical (3rd Edition. April 2012)<br/> ISBN-13:  978-1408152836<br> This edition has been thoroughly revised, containing updates to cruising information, new regulations, new developments and new photos. Although the Mediterranean provides wonderfully diverse cruising opportunities, it can also deliver a few surprises to the unwary. Rod Heikell gives sound advice on anchoring, berthing bow or stern-to, what weather to expect, facilities and the costs of keeping a boat there, plus advice on navigation, popular routes, formalities and what to expect ashore.</br></p>
