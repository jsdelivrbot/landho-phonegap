            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Formalities are lengthy if not using an agent (it is possible officials may refuse to deal with you directly, if you choose not to hire an agent). Each arrival must be registered with Immigration. All foreign flagged boats are liable for a Customs Fee, which will be done with the Agent in Hurghada, along with the other paperwork.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Hurghada Port, you can either come alongside the dock (if there's space between the  fast ferry and fishing boats) or drop anchor just outside. It is better to turn up at Hurghada Port early in the morning and try and avoid Fridays, as most officials will be off or away praying.</p>
<p>The agent will take the ship's documents, passports, and last Port Clearance. It can take up to four hours to complete formalities. The agent will keep the documents in order to finish all the necessary clearances before returning them. Agency fee approx. US$60.</p>
<p>Written permission is required to move the boat anywhere within the port, even to get fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is now possible to clear in at Abu Tig Marina.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Egypt/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><b>Agents</b></a> for details of any Clearance agents.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Everytime you go sailing, call your agent 24 hours in advance, give him all
 passports, 2 crew lists. Also tell him where you are going and call him when you get back.</p>
<p>Do not leave or enter the Marina at night.</p>
