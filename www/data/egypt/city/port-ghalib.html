<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Ghalib is an official port of entry to Egypt.</p>
<p>See<strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Egypt?rc=Formalities"> Egypt Formalities</a></strong> for full details on clearing into and out of Egypt.</p>
<p><span>Call port control on VHF Ch:10 or 16, preferably 2 hours before arrival, otherwise well before reaching the entrance channel.</span></p>
<p>This is an easy place to clear in to the country and get visas as all entry formalities can be completed at the marina office without the need to hire an agent or travel to any other place.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>The Marina provides clearance formalities at these costs:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Government fee</strong> - formalities for foreign yachts up to 18 metres (valid 1 mth): USD 30 (USD 50 for larger yachts);</p>
<p><strong>Immigration stamps</strong> - Egyptian visa (per person): USD 25</p>
<p><strong>Processing fee </strong>(marina acts as agent): USD 80 per yacht</p>
<p><strong>Berthing</strong> up to 8 hours in the marina (to complete formalities): USD 13 (15 m LOA).</p>
<p><strong>Note: <br/><span>Fees are payable only once per visit to Egypt at at any licensed port of entry. The marina will issue a receipt which should be shown at subsequent ports or marinas so as not to have to pay additional fees for formalities.</span><br/></strong>This applies to tourist marinas (such as Port Ghalib, Abu Tig Marina, Wadi Dome, Hurghada Marina). It does not apply to Sharm El Sheikh, where you will be liable for further fees.</p>
