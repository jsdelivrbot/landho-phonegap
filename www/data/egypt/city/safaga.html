<div class="hello"><div><p>The majority of yachts clear into Egypt here. It is possible to complete formalities without the use of an agent. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Egypt/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Agents</a> for details of any Clearance agents.</p>
<p>Call Safaga Port Control on VHF Channel 16 on approach. Calls are usually answered by Safaga Pilot, but not so promptly at night. The port captain insists that boats (especially those arriving from abroad) come alongside the main dock, although this is sometimes unsuitable for small boats. The recommended anchorage (26°47.59'N 33°56.33'E) is in front of the Paradise Hotel.  The boat is usually visited first by security police. One should have several crew lists ready.  Arms and ammunition should be declared immediately on arrival. The rest of the formalities are completed ashore. The immigration office is at the harbour gates (third floor). Boats are occasionally visited by a quarantine officer who may ask for a fee.</p>
<p>The same offices must be visited on departure, even if sailing to another Egyptian port. Non-uniformed police may board the boat before departure.</p>
<p>Rough Cost Estimation for government &amp; agency fees for up to 1 month stay is around US$180 and for each 4 month period, it is around US$ 280. Plus the Customs Fee on top. These fees include all the various fees in Safaga Port and the Agency fee.</p>
