            </h2>
<div><p>Due to recent changes to the way Visas on Arrival and Sailing Permits are issued, it is recommended that yachts clear in at Port Ghalib. See <a href="../../Members/val/R2012-06-11-1"><strong>Cruising Permit Regulations June 2012</strong></a> for the fine detail.</p>
<p>In ports of entry, clearance must be done with Customs, Health and Immigration, and a "Sailing Permit" obtained from the Port Authority.</p>
<p><span>The Coast Guard normally maintain a presence in all ports and anchorages, and usually visit the yacht, requesting details of the yacht and its crew. However, it's likely y<span>ou will need an agent at every major port as the authorities don’t usually speak English and will only deal with the agents they know. You have to let your agent know your whereabouts at all times so he can "smooth the way" with the authorities.</span></span></p>
<p>The simplest and cheapest place to clear into Egypt, is the marina at <b><a class="external-link" href="PortGhalib/">Port Ghalib</a></b>. At all other ports, an agent will be required. They have good clearance advice on their website, see <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.portghalib.com/marina/rules-and-formalities">http://www.portghalib.com/marina/rules-and-formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p>If transiting the Canal and not stopping anywhere else after the transit, the outward clearance can be obtained while doing the transit formalities. Yachts may then proceed to sea as soon as they have dropped the pilot.</p>
<p>Once outward clearance is obtained, yachts must leave within 24 hours, or obtain another clearance.</p>
<p>Noonsite does not recommend any particular agent but there is a list of Clearance agents <a href="?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>here</strong>.</a> It can be useful to look at reports from cruisers for their various experiences.</p>

<div><p><span>If </span><span>arriving in Egypt by boat, most nationalities are still</span><span> issued visas on arrival. The cost is US$25.</span></p>
<p>Citizens of some countries are required to obtain a visa in advance.  These currently are:-<br/> Palestine, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Mauritania, Lebanon, China, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali, Chad.</p>
<p><span>In addition, female citizens of the Republic of Moldova aged 15-35 are required to have a visa in advance.</span></p>
<p>Most visas are valid for three months from the date of issue. An extension to a visa can be obtained from the police. Passports must be valid for six months beyond the visa period.</p>
<p>You may have difficulties leaving Egypt if your visa is out of date. You will not normally be allowed to leave if the visa is out of date by more than 14 days.</p>
<p>There are Egyptian embassies or consulates in most nearby countries, including Israel (Tel Aviv) and Djibouti.</p>
<p>If planning to visit Israel and return to Egypt, it is possible to buy a re-entry permit, which expires one day before the original visa expires.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.egyptianconsulate.co.uk/visas.php"><strong>Egyptian Embassy website</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Transiting the Suez Canal</strong></p>
<p>Visas are not needed by anyone travelling on a yacht transiting the Suez Canal and remaining in the port area.</p>

<p>A cruising permit can be obtained on arrival. Outside of the official ports of entry, in other ports and anchorages, one may not go ashore except with special permission from the local authorities. Most anchorages have an army post or military station, who usually ask for the yacht's papers. Yachts coming from Sudan and making overnight stops without going ashore do not normally require a cruising permit. If sheltering from strong winds or making an overnight stop, yachts are normally allowed to stay in Egyptian waters before clearing in at an official port of entry. If coming from the Red Sea and intending to stop in Egypt before clearing in, it is advisable to have obtained a visa in advance.</p>
<p>If planning a Suez Canal Transit and in possession of new SSR documents, read warning <a href="../../Members/sue/R2008-09-16-3">here</a>.</p>
<p>River Nile: A security permit has to be obtained from the Coast Guard as well as permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to navigate the river. The permit is difficult to obtain, although the Yacht Club of Egypt in Alexandria may be able to help. Navigation in the channels is restricted to daytime only. There are several bridges and locks, which open at certain times of the day or on request. Taking photographs of bridges, barrages and dams is strictly forbidden. The maximum draft must not exceed 5 ft (1.5 m). Navigation is only possible during winter, from October to May, when the level of water is higher. The river depth falls considerably during the summer months.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>A visa on arrival costs $25. If a visa is not required, there are no immigration fees due on arrival or departure.</p>
<p>All visiting yachts staying in Egypt for more than the permitted "transit" period of 10 days, must pay a monthly fee.</p>
<p>This fee is levied either for just one month or four months, the following four months then the final four months, after a total of 12 months the vessel must leave Egypt.</p>
<p>A form must be signed by the Owner/captain who undertakes that the yacht will leave the country upon the expiry of the temporary clearance period (maximum 12 months) granted by Customs, the period is granted based on the Owner/Captain's request and subject to paying the clearance fees.</p>
<p>Yachts clearing into Port Ghalib Marina are charged much reduced fees. At Hurghada it costs approximately double that of Port Ghalib.</p>
<p>A receipt should be issued by the marina and shown at subsequent ports or marinas so as not to have to pay additional fees for formalities.</p>
<p>Other fees include Suez Canal transit fee and pilotage, port authority fee, stamp duty, quarantine and immigration. Overtime is charged after 1400 Saturday to Thursday, all day Friday and public holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Suez Canal Fees</strong></p>
<p>Suez Canal Transit and Pilotage Fees will be indicated by the Suez Canal officials who board the yacht on arrival and measure the yacht; varies from US$300-700. It is advisable to visit the<span> Suez Canal Measurement office and check the calculation to ensure your agent is not over-charging.</span></p>
<p><span>The canal transit does require any security fee to be paid.</span></p>
<p>Ashraf Soukar (Prince of the Red Sea) is the agent with the best reputation and who handles most cruising yachts in Suez. He normally monitors VHF Channel 16. His 2016 fees are as follows:</p>
<p>1.       Port Clearance – 20 US$.<br/>2.       Insurance Certificate – 5 US$.<br/>3.       Agency Fees – 50 US$.<br/>4.       Canal Toll – can give advance estimation.<br/>5.       Mooring fees at Suez Yacht Club:<br/>-          Up to 10 m long – 16 US$ per day and include Water-Electric – Shower.<br/>-          10-15 m long – 21 US$.<br/>-          Over 15 m long – 30 US$.</p>
<p>All agents' and Suez Canal fees must be paid in US dollars, therefore some cash should be carried. It is advisable that, where possible, the services expected and the fees to be paid should be fully agreed beforehand.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>All military zones are prohibited areas.</p>
<p>Anchorages are permitted around Abu Tig, but the general restrictions are not to land on the islands and to keep a distance of one nautical mile away from them and not to anchor beside corals or  military areas, as per the chart.</p>
<p>Spearfishing, the taking of reef fish, collecting of coral, shells and marine animals, are all forbidden in the Red Sea.</p>
<p><strong>Canal regulations</strong><br/> Yachts must be capable of a consistent speed of 5 knots, which will be checked during the technical inspection. The speed limit in the canal is 9 knots. Yachts normally transit just after the morning convoy.</p>
<p>It is not permitted to sail in either <span>in the canal or the Bitter Lakes.</span></p>
<p><span>If a yacht breaks down, <span>you can only be towed by a Canal Authority boat (at a high fee!).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Canal transit takes 2 days with a stop-over at <span>Ismalia.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong><br/> There have been reports of several yachts being run aground, and one severely damaged, due to the incompetence of the Egyptian pilot. It is therefore strongly recommended that at no time should the pilot be allowed to steer the boat, that the latest charts of the Canal are constantly referred to and that if it appears that the pilot is giving wrong instructions, such as advising the person at the helm to leave the main channel to cut a corner, the captain should use his or her commonsense before accepting such advice.</p></div>
