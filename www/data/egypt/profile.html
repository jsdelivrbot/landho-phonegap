<ul>
<li>Most yachts visit Egypt only to transit the Suez Canal and very few visit the country itself.</li>
<li>The only area of the country worth cruising is in the Red Sea, the reefs and bays stretching from the Sudanese border to the Gulf of Suez. Day sailing along this coast is the most pleasant way to make progress against the prevailing northerlies.</li>
<li>Safaga or Hurgada, on the Red Sea, are both places where the boat can be left to visit the interior; although at neither should the boat be left unattended.</li>
<li>In past years the Red Sea coast saw a rapid growth in tourist resorts and developments including several new marinas, such as the Abu Tig and  Port Ghalib Marinas, which form part of large resorts.</li>
<li>In the Mediterranean, Alexandria is the only alternative to Port Said.</li>
<li>Occasionally yachts manage to obtain a permit to sail up the River Nile, a fascinating but not easy way to see Egypt</li>

<div><p><span>The latest advice from the British F.O. is to avoid all but essential travel to most parts of the country.</span></p>
<p>There are violent demonstrations taking place in many towns and cities and there have been attacks on foreign nationals including in  Hurghada.</p>

<div><p>Very hot summers; mild winters with little rain. The prevailing winds in the Red Sea are northerly, while along the Mediterranean coast there are daily alternating land and sea breezes. Occasionally the khamsin, a hot dry wind, blows off the land laden with dust and sand reducing visibility.</p>
