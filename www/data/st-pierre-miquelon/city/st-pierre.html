<div class="hello"><div><p>Call by radio to "TXU Saint-Pierre" or by phone, 18 hours before arrival.</p>
<p>Documents must include clearance from the previous port, boat registration and crew list.</p>
<p>If arriving during normal working hours, once inside the harbour you can expect to get visited by both Customs officials and the Gendarmes but the whole procedure is very friendly and relaxed.</p>
<div><span>If arriving over a holiday period you may simply be told to fill in a form and deposit it in the box outside the Customs office on the main quay.</span></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Beware of lobster pots and fishing nets with floating lines between in the approaches to St Pierre harbour. Keeping well north of Ile aux Pigeons appears to offer a clearer path.</p>
<p><span>The harbour master may allow you to lie alongside the main quay, close to where the high speed ferries berth, for which there is no charge. However there are no facilities here and this quay is not particularly yacht friendly unless you have large fenders and a substantial fender board. </span></p>
<p><span>Most yachts will prefer to go alongside the sailing centre a little further into the harbour. There is an overnight charge of 3 euros per m, but the facilities are excellent with electricity (240V), fresh water and wifi available on the jetty, and toilets/showers/launderette in the sailing centre building.</span></p>
