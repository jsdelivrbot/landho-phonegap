<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Chiapas is the southern most port in Mexico and 14 miles north of the Mexico-Guatemala border on the Pacific coast. Cruisers recommend this as a good place to haul out and do bottom work on your boat, and even store it during rainy season.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/MarinaChiapas.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/></p>
<p>Logistically, it is the ideal place for northbound yachts to clear into Mexico and wait for a safe crossing of the notoriously windy 260-mile-wide Gulf of Tehuantepec. For southbound boats, it is a convenient stopover for refuelling, reprovisioning and for handling Zarpe paperwork before departing Mexico into Central American cruising waters.</p>
<p>Formally known as Puerto Madero, the name was changed a few years ago after the cruise ship terminal was built.  Cruisers report that a great deal of work is on-going to improve the port and make it welcoming to visiting yachtsmen. Marina Chiapas (see photo taken from their website) opened here in December 2011.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Call the port captain on VHF Ch. 16 when you are near the sea buoy to ask permission to enter the port and give notice of where you intend to moor.  All of the port officials speak English and all formalities can be carried out at the marina.</p>
<p>If you call the marina when you are a couple of miles out, they will come out to greet you and guide you in. <span>The Port Captain, Customs, and Health inspection will come on board to complete formalities. Immigration are based at the airport which is 10 minutes by car. Cruisers have reported being given a lift there by marina staff. </span></p>
<p>If you arrive having applied online for a Temporary Import Permit (TIP) in advance, you won't have any problems checking in here. However, if you intend to get a TIP on arrival, this port is not recommended as the officials are not familiar with the necessary paperwork. Huatulco is the closest alternative port for clearance and the TIP process is reported to be relatively straightforward there. More comments on the TIP by cruisers who have visited PC can be found <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mexico/mexico-puerto-chiapas-marina-chiapas-highly-recommended-by-cruiser/view#1393386665478112">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>Note that if you checked out of Mexico in Huatulco you cannot enter Puerto Chiapas for any reason (except emergencies) with out having to check back into (and out) of the country. Being low on fuel, tired, engine problems, and similar is not considered an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: <span>ALL boats are searched with a dog upon arrival AND departure, so plan ahead for paperwork one day and departure the next day. </span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The curved access channel into the new private yacht basin lies off the eastern corner of the east bay, at Puerto Chiapas. The east bay also houses the Mexican navy base and two fuel docks.</p>
<p>Cruise ships enter and dock in the northern bay of Puerto Chiapas, so if boaters wish to anchor there temporarily, it is at the discretion of the port captain. The API charge 80 peso/day for mooring here.</p>
<p>The marina’s access channel and yacht basin are dredged to a minimum depth of 15 feet at mean low water. The location provides 360-degree shelter from Tehuantepec winds and is a good hurricane hole. This marina offers some of <span>the best facilities for cruisers along the entire Pacific coast of Mexico. </span></p>
<p>The harbormaster is called Enrique Laclette and is reported to be very helpful. It may be difficult however to get an answer by email and the marina website is suspended (2016). Best to call by telephone in advance.</p>
<p>The marina no longer operate a shuttle into Tapachula for shopping, but buses and taxis are available. In Tapachula t<span>here is a Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Auto Zone, Sam's Club.......  and it is a $20 taxi ride back. There are no chandleries/boat parts or accessories available here however. so if planning on doing work on your boat here it's advisable to bring everything with you.</span></p>
