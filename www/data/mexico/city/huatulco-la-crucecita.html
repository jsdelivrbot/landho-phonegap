<div class="hello"><div><p>Huatulco (Bahias de Huatulco) is a resort town located at the southern end of Mexico’s Pacific Coast, south of Acapulco. It sits at the foot of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains on a series of nine bays, surrounded by quiet,  unspoiled tropical beauty.</p>
<p>It is a very useful location to wait out strong winds or to clear in or out of Mexico.</p>
<p>Location 15° 45.97'N, 96° 07.2'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Marina now checks you in and out if you are arriving / departing to/from a Mexican Port. Thus saving you a trip to the Port Captain.</span></p>
<p><span>To obtain a Temporary Import Permit if this is your first Mexican port, go to the <span>Banjercito Bank. Cruisers report the paperwork is pretty straightforward.</span></span></p>
<p>The Marina however cannot assist with zarpes or clearance out of the country. <span>After obtaining proof that your marina bill is paid, you must go to the Port Captain in Santa Cruz, then to the bank, then to Immigration, then to Customs (with perhaps another bank visit). Customs makes arrangements to inspect your boat. You will need to start all this several days in advance of your anticipated weather window for the Tehuantepec if you are going south.</span></p>
<p>The Port Captain and Customs are only open 09:00-17:00 on weekdays. Immigration office closes at 13:00.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina here is a Fonatur marina and reported to be very friendly. It is a 30 minute walk from the town centre (25 pesos for a taxi).</p>
<p>The anchorage to the south west, at Santa Cruz, has room for several transient boats to the east of the cruise ship dock.  The anchorage is limited by coral, the channel to the darsena, and panga moooring bouys. It is possible to use the sea wall behind the tour boat dock to secure the dinghy. If going into the town, if will be cheaper to walk a couple of blocks away from the cruise ship berths before picking up a taxi.</p>
<p>The town, has a supermarket, also hardware stores and some chandlery/fishing supplies.</p>

The entrance to the marina is extremely narrow and has several jogs; cruisers advise to stay in the exact centre.
Power and water to all pontoons. Cold water outdoor showers. Surge and current in the marina makes safe manuevering very difficult for boats over 30ft long. New fuel dock opened April 2014 (open Monday to Friday only).<br>
The current Harbour Master, Ezequiel Gutierrez Arechiga, speaks English.
