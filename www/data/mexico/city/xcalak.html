<div class="hello"><div><p>This is <strong>not</strong> an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p>On arrival, take a copy of your papers to the port captain's office.</p>
<p>If needing to clear into or out of Mexico here, one can travel to the inland port of Chetumal to complete clearance procedures. This is however a 5 hour bus ride each way.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Entrance through the reef can be tricky. If in doubt, call the Harbour Master on Ch. 16. Normally locals will come out to guide you if they spot you outside the reef.</p>
<p>This is principally an anchorage, but the XTC Diving Centre offers limited dockage and a dinghy dock.</p>
<p>The rebuilt town dock is now completed after recent hurricane damage, with 6ft at the end of the dock and steps about 1/2 way down on the north side.</p>
