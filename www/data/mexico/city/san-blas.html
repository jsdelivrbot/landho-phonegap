<div class="hello"><div><p>San Blas, a small fishing village 20 miles north of  Santa Cruz, has a variety of attractions such as beaches, colonial architecture, history, many species of exotic birds, a thick tropical jungle, estuaries and a navigable river. It was was an important Spanish port from the late 16th to the 19th century.</p>
<p>Whilst the "no see-ums" can be a problem here, it's worth applying lots of insect repellent as the town and people are worth a visit.</p></div></div>
