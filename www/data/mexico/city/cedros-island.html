<div class="hello"><div><p>Cedros Island is situated off Mexico's western coast. This region is the real Baja, not a regular tourist destination; with honest, authentic and resilient people who adopted Cedros island as their home, and have been living from their abundant ocean resources for generations.</p>
<p>It's pricipal industry is the export of salt, and because of this Cedros’ port ranks as Mexico's third-largest, carrying over 7 million metric tons of salt per year. The population is reported as being somewhere between 1500-5,000 persons as there are many seasonal residents, such as relatives moving in and out, visiting in summer, and those who come for the fishing season to work.</p>
<p>There are two main towns on Cedros Island, El Morro, and Cedros Town. The former is at the southernmost point of the island, where the employees of the salt company live in housing and infrastructure provided by the company. Cedros Town is about four times bigger; most of the inhabitants are fishermen, service providers and small business owners.</p>
<p>Cedros Town: Position 28°02.35'N, 115°11.7'W.</p>
<p><b>The San Benitos Islands </b>are situated about 16 miles West of Cedros Island and are a great destination for wildlife watching, hiking and snorkelling. Cruisers liken these islands to the Galapagos with very friendly fishermen and amazing wildlife. See reports adjacent with further details.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>You will need to officially clear into Mexico at Ensenada before stopping
at Isla Cedros harbour as you cannot clear Immigration and obtain a Tourist Permit here. <i>(Note: Cedros harbour is listed in some books as a port of entry as there are indeed 2 immigration officials based here. Whilst they can do the appropriate paperwork, there is no bank on the island at which you can pay for the tourist permit and therefore immediate departure for another port of entry would be required in order to avoid a fine.)</i></p>
<p>Visiting yachts will need to check in with the Port Captain, come alongside the dock where the Port Captain offices are located.  </p>
<p>Make sure you have your valid Mexican tourist permit, and your fishing permit (if you plan to fish) before stopping here.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are no facilities or moorings for yachts here. Anchor off Cedros Town after checking in. El Morro town, 5 miles south, is where salt is off loaded and the main docks are situated.</p>
<p>With advance notice Cedros Outdoor Adventures can help to pre-arrange docking and landing on the island.</p>
<p>Cedros town has a recently paved main street leading from the harbour. The fishing co-op runs a cannery, a couple of small grocery stores (beer and liquor, limited selection of foods, mostly dried and canned, with produce and ice especially hard to come by), a couple of cafes and two restaurants. El Marino and La Pacenita serve breakfasts, good Mexican food and
seafood in the local styles. There are also taco stands, burritos, and hotdogs on vending cars at night. Food, snacks, beer and liquor can be purchased in local stores. </p>
<p>The island also has 2 churches, a pharmacy, an airport serving various destinations in Baja California and a new hotel with internet service and hot showers. </p>
