<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Mexico?rc=Formalities"><b>Noonsite/Mexico/Clearance</b></a> page for full details.</p>
<p>For clearing in here as an international arrival, cruisers recommend the easiest way is at the CIS office in Puerto Juarez, 4nm north of Cancun. All the required offices are under one roof, each with 1 - 2 officials on duty, all within sight of one another. There is an Information Desk with English speakers to help you. Hours: 9-5 weekdays, 9-12 Saturdays, Sundays by appointment.</p>
<p>The CIS office is about 3 blocks north of the Puerto Juarez ferry terminal, or a block north of Marina Hacienda del Mar, but on the inland side of the coast road, or about 5 miles south of the newer Marina La Amada. Both marinas are very helpful if you want to just tie up temporarily for a couple hours in order to handle your International Arrival paperwork, even if you don't want to stay in the marina overnight.</p>
<p>This is the only place on the Caribbean side of Mexico where a TIP can be obtained (June 2013).</p>
