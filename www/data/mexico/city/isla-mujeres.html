<div class="hello"><div><p>This long, narrow island lies off the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, 8 miles northeast of Cancún. The island is close to many coral reefs,  as well as the Cancun underwater museum, created by English sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mexico?rc=Formalities">Mexico Formalities</a></strong> page for full details of clearing into and out of Mexico.</p>
<p>This port can be closed if a hurricane is imminent due to the heavy seas over the shoals. However, arriving boats are permitted to enter.</p>
<p><span>There is no official requirement to hire an agent and the Mexican government is keen to promote its simplified clearance procedures. To which end, there is now a bank on Isla Mujeres where Immigration fees can be paid. If it is decided to use an agent, it is best to ‘shop around’ as there are several offering their services.</span></p>
<p>Clear in with Sanitation (Health) first, then Immigration, followed by Customs, and finally Port Captain. The Port Captain's office is on the front street opposite the ferry wharf; Immigration is also on the main road and Harbour Master next door. A health inspection is carried out at the local hospital.</p>
<p>Additionally agriculture may or may not come out to the vessel to inspect. This inspection is done on a case by case situation and is not often.</p>
<p>The Port Captain now requires a Zarpe (which includes a notorised crew list) for ALL boats, including those arriving from the USA. Vessels arriving without a list will be fined. <i>For US boats obtaining a Zarpe is difficult, but not impossible. See <a href="Countries/USA?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/USA/Formalities</strong></a> for the details.</i></p>
<p>Try to avoid clearance on the weekends as the port Captain's office charges overtime. It won't break the bank, an extra $40.00 USD, however on week days clearance is cheaper and faster (approx. two hours). The Port Captain's office is open from 0800hrs until 1700hrs, however they only work from 0900hrs until 1400hrs. Arrival outside these hours is normally not a problem if you are staying at a marina, as they can inform customs of your arrival and arrange clearance for the next morning. In this instance, you will be allowed off your boat, but restricted to the Marina area for the night. If anchoring, all crew must remain on board until clearance the following morning.</p>
<p>The Navy sometimes inspects vessels in the harbour.</p>
<p>The Puerto Isla Mujeres Marina and Marina Paraiso will assist those berthed there with formalities, both having <span>onsite agents to help with the clearance process. There will be a charge for this service.</span></p>
<p>A very useful report on how to clear in here WITHOUT an agent is<a href="Countries/Mexico/mexico-isla-mujeres-clearing-into-isla-mujeres-mexico-from-belize"><strong>here</strong>.</a></p>
<p>If staying in Mexico more than 3-5 days, then a TIP (Tempoary importation document) is required. T<span>his is issued in Cancun after checking in at a cost of $50.00usd</span>.
