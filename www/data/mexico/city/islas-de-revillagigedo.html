<div class="hello"><div><p>The group has been declared a marine reserve and it is patrolled by the Mexican Navy which has a garrison on the main island of Socorro. There is also a Navy garrison established in Clarion. Clearance should be completed with them. The islands are occasionally visited by scuba and fishing expeditions. There are few anchorages and no facilities for yachts in transit, other than the help that the Mexican Navy provides in case of emergencies.</p></div></div>
