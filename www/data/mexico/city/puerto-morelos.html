<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Morelos is a quiet, laid back type of place where traditional fishermen can make a living. Tourism, especially diving, is just developing but the town remains unspoilt by it.</p>
<p>It lies between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, and is a pleasant stop on the way to Isla Mujeres.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a clearly marked channel through the reef to the ferry dock area and the town quay, (which is 1/2 mile north of the dock).</p>
<p>The area off the town, once used for anchoring, is now part of a marine park and no anchoring is allowed. There are no longer any mooring balls available either, so the marina is the only option here for docking.</p>
<p><span>Anchoring and fishing are prohibited.</span></p>
<p>The entrance to the marina is 1/2 mile SW of the centre of the town and is well marked.</p>
<p>On the left/port side as you enter the marina are 6 mooring buoys inside the breakwater for vessels up to 45ft or 35 tonnes (approx. $12 per day).</p>
<p>You can leave your dinghy on the dock of the local restaurant Los Pellicanos.</p>
