<div class="hello"><div><p><span>While Mazatlan has a big industrial harbour, the marinas are located in an estuary to the north of the city. <span>It is best to enter the channel leading to the marinas at high tide, and slack tide, as the currents can be very strong - up to 4 kts. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If coming here for fuel, the easiest fuel dock to access is El Cid, but beware of the currents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cruisers report Mazatlan to have a great sailing community.</span></span></span></p>
<p>What<strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/"> Lonely Planet </a></strong>say about Mazatlan: <br/><i>Having outgrown its image as a chintzy mid-20th-century resort town, today’s Mazatlán is one of Mexico’s most alluring and inviting beach destinations. Over the past decade, the ‘Pearl of the Pacific’ has breathed new life into its historic center, and the ongoing renewal program continues to bear fruit. The result is something truly unique: a historic city with a resplendent colonial district only a short walk from a 20km-long crescent of sandy beach.</i></p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can anchor off and dinghies can be left at one of the yacht agencies on the shore. The Immigration and Port Captain offices are farther up the harbour, just past the cruise ship terminal.</p>
<p>The Port Captain charges an anchorage fee and may also insist on clearance being done through one of the marinas. <span>Both the new marinas offer a port clearance service.</span></p>
<p>Boats on short stays can clear in and out at the same time.</p>
<p>Obtaining a Temporary Import Permit here, if this is your first Mexican port, is reported to be straightforward.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are now two new marinas located 6 miles up the coast from Mazatlan. They are both in the channel leading to Laguna Sabalo. <span>From here it's a 5 minute ride by </span><span>local open-air taxi (called a </span><code>Pulmonia</code><span>)</span><span> into the old harbour at Mazatlan.</span></p>
<p>Club Nautico also has a marina just inside the commercial harbour. These three marinas monitor VHF Channel 16.</p>
<p>Marina El Cid is a popular location for sport fishermen as the local hotel and the marina both sponsor tournaments. It is too exposed to provide a hurricane hole.</p>
<p>Further inland, is Marina Mazatlan, which is home to many long-term sailboats. It provides a much greater degree of protection as does the <span>Isla Mazatlan Golden resort.</span></p>
<p>Club Nautico is small, with few berths and offers no protection in a hurricane.</p>
<p>Fonatur is the newest marina/boatyard and has a few slips, travelift and dry storage facilities.</p>

      There are only a few berths here (although we have also been told it is only an anchorage (free)). Exposed in stong winds.
Club Nautico is no longer a conventional yacht club, as its building would indicate. It is a fenced area containing a boat launch ramp and bathrooms with a shower. They are friendly and helpful people. There is a small charge for using the dinghy dock, which includes use of the showers, but they often seem to consider it a fair trade if you buy your diesel and gasoline from them. They'll arrange for a truck to deliver purified water, and sell you chips, sodas, ice and nuts at inexpensive prices. They'll also arrange to have your laundry done and delivered, and your mail forwarded to their office. At sunset they lock the gates and a guard is posted, so your dinghy will be secure if you go out for a night on the town.

It is located on a narrow piece of land extending from Old Town and  sits between a shipyard and several sport-fishing concessions. Across the street is the sewage treatment plant! It is about a 30 minute walk into the centre of the town.
