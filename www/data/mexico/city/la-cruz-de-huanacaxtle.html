<div class="hello"><div><p>This small fishing port, with its large new marina, lies about 15nm northwest of Puerto Vallarta on the north coast of the large Bahía de Banderas. It is a popular destination and the primary spot from which most cruisers travel by land to other places around the Bay.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Local Time in La Cruz de Huanacaxtle is the same as Puerto Vallarta time even though it is offically in a different time zone.</p>
<p>Position 20° 45'N, 105° 24'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If berthing in the marina, then they will handle the clearance for you.</p>
<p>If anchored outside, visit the Port Captain's office.  This is located in the offices betweeen the Mercado del Mar and the shipyard on the
starboard side as you enter the Marina.</p>
<p>As you head in, via your Dinghy, hail the office on VHF 16 to announce your arrival.</p>
<p>The marina's dinghy dock fee is not required to be paid if just visiting
the Port Captain's Office.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina here is generally known as Marina de La Cruz.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage outside and, for a fee (now a $50 MXN fee per day), it is possible to use the dinghy dock inside the marina.</p>
<p>The dinghy dock is now Dock #1 by the Marina Offices.</p>
<p>To reach this, proceed into the marina, passing the fuel dock to starboard and then take a turn to port and it is off to the starboard side at the end of the fairway.</p>
