            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated on the eastern coast of Baja California and tucked into the Bay de La Paz at the southern end of this peninsula, La Paz offers a very welcome sheltered stop over. The local cruising ground has many islands and attractive anchorages. It is the cruising centre of the Sea of Cortez, and almost all repair work can be done here. Parts can be obtained from the US and the postal service is more reliable than in other parts of Mexico.</p>
<p><span>La Paz, Cabo San Lucas and Escondido suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Odile in September 2014 however all</span><span> the damage has now been repaired. </span></p>
<p><span>There is a new channel approx. 50 meters west of the one described in the cruising guide "Sea of Cortez". The channel is well marked. There is another new channel marked across the sandbar and along the Mogote side of that bar (the side away from La Paz). </span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a sunken yacht near the Mogote Beach which at low tide is only a few feet below the water. The GPS Coordinates for the wreck are: N 24 09.914 x W 110 19.688.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Note that the port captain closes the port in heavy weather, so it is recommended to check with the marinas about the current status prior to arrival. In winter months especially, strong northerly winds blow for several days at a time.</span></p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Customs and immigration offices are in the Federal building behind the municipal quay. Port captain's office in Calle Francesco Madero north of the quay.</p>
<p>Note that the port captain will not process a crew list for boats heading for other Mexican ports -they only require you to call them.  This practice can be sticky if you head directly for Barra de Navidad, where the port captain requires paperwork!</p>
<p><span>Obtaining a Temporary Import Permit here, if this is your first Mexican port, is reported to be straightforward.</span></p>
<p>The cost for obtaining an international zarpe to leave Mexico from La Paz is about US$ 150.00, $100 of that is for a "sanitation" inspection, which amounts to the official filling out the paperwork.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several marinas, the three largest being Marina Palmira, Marina de La Paz and Costa Baja. All of these marinas have good gate systems, 24-hour guards, and video cameras. All marinas monitor VHF Channel 16.</p>
<p>Be aware that many of the smaller facilities do not have security, and often just a fence with a gate that may be frequently left open. Cruisers should avoid leaving any valuable items on deck.</p>
<p>For boats at anchor, there is a port authority dinghy dock at the municipal pier where there is 24-hour security. Alternatively some of the marinas have dinghy docks. Take care leaving your dinghy shoreside as outboard thefts are on the increase here.</p>
<p><b><i>Note: </i></b><span>The port captain closes the port in heavy weather, and there are stiff fines for leaving port when it is closed (announced by blue and yellow flags flying at Marina de La Paz and Marina Palmira). </span></p>
<p>La Paz Cruisers' Net takes place Monday - Saturday at 8:00 a.m. on VHF Channel 22. including information on weather and tides.</p>
