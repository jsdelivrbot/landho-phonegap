<div class="hello"><div><p>This Caribbean island is located 12 miles off the Mexican coast, on the eastern side of the Yucatan Peninsula.  It is a mecca for divers and renowned  for its coral reefs. The limestone shore is surrounded by temperate, crystal clear water which ranges in colour from stunning turquoise to deep indigo.</p>
<p>Position 20° 29'05"N, 86° 58'47"W (San Miguel)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><a href="Countries/Mexico?rc=Formalities"><b>Noonsite/Mexico/Clearance</b></a><span> page for full details.</span></p>
<p>This island is a favourite place for clearing in or out of Mexico.</p>
<p>Call the Capitania de Puerto de Cozumel on arrival, who will then advise the Navy, who may (together with Customs and/or Health) inspect the boat. if no answer, visit the Port Captain's office ashore.</p>
<p>Yachts anchor at San Miguel, on the north side of the commercial dock. The wharf is used by large ferries so one should not come alongside, unless prepared to move off at short notice. The anchorage is uncomfortable in westerlies and strong northerlies.</p>
<p>The Port Captain's office is on the waterfront, while the Customs office is at the airport. Clearing in formalities tend to be lengthy, as serveral offices  around the town need to be visited as follows:-</p>
<p>First go to the Port Captain's office (2nd floor) or directly to the office of the "Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transporte" (1st floor). They'll give you a document called "Solicitud de Autorizacion de Arribo" (Arrival Authorization Request), which you take to the airport.<br/> Then go to the airport to the Offices of Immigration, Customs, International Health and Agriculture (best in this order), fill in their papers and get stamps from them on the document "Solicitud de Autorizacion de Arribo" (Arrival Authorization Request).<br/> Return with that document to the "Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transporte", they finish check-in, costs 306 Mexican Pesos (approx USD 30) and they give you a document called "Acuse de Recibo de Documentos".<br/> That is it; there are no further fees to be paid.</p>
<p>The easier alternative is to go directly to the yacht club, (Club Nautico) which operates a marina and has an agent who deals with all necessary formalities for a fee (approx US$100).  Customs and Immigration officials usually inspect boats at the yacht club and the Port Captain also has a representative there.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is just north of the town.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor between the marina and the ferry dock.</p>
<p>If going into town, it is possible, with permission, to leave the dinghy at the Aqua Safari dive shop dock.</p>
