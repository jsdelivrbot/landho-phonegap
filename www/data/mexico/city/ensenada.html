<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is reported to be the simplest place on the Pacific coast of Mexico to make first entry into the country and secure your TIP paperwork. Officials are used to dealing with foreign yachts.</p>
<p><span>International Arrival Port Clearance for yachts is done all in one place, the big CIS office. It contains offices for Migracion, Aduana, Capitania, Agriculture, Navy, and you pay one fee by credit card. This is where you get your TIP. You do not need an agent. </span></p>
<p><span>Officials will only inspect your boat if there is some problem. They</span><span> do not work at weekends. </span></p>
<p><span>Boats are either anchored inside the breakwater or taken to Pirates Pier, a marina offering a limited range of services.</span></p>
<p>If any crew member flies into Mexico and then wishes to sail out, they may experience difficulties in getting an exit stamp. See <a href="Members/val/R2009-05-29-1">Noonsite report</a>.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the most northerly Port of Entry on Mexico's Pacific coast. There are 3 full service marinas here. Two inside the harbour breakwaters and one just under 3 nm north of the town.</p>
<p>There are moorings by the sport fishing docks on the eastern side of the harbour. This is a popular port of call, and berths and anchorages can be in short supply.</p>
<p>As of 2007, anchoring is prohibited in the harbour. It is not known how long this restriction is expected to last.</p>
