<div class="hello"><div><p>Located on the north western side of Banderas Bay, about 25nm north west of Puerto Vallarta, Punta de Mita is a quiet, comfortable place to stop. Cruisers report that while missing some of the amenities and the convenience of a marina, it is a much more comfortable anchorage than La Cruz as the daily thermal induced winds blow offshore and thus the wind waves are not as great.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is basically an anchorage as the breakwaters (built of boulders), enclose a small harbour which is full of local boats. It does provide a sheltered beach on which to land a dinghy. There are two more breakwaters to the west of the harbour which also shelter the beach from the swell.</p>
<p>This is a surf spot so incoming swell can be uncomfortable when there is no wind at night. Some boats do put out stern anchors, so check for that when setting your own hook.</p>
