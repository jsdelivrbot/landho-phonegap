<div class="hello"><div><p>The name of this city is probably well known to most people, and is famous for its beaches, night life and other holiday attractions.</p>
<p>Reports from cruisers state that the town is quite dangerous with drug related crime, however the marina is reported to be safe.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts can either anchor outside or arrange a berth in the yacht club marina. The yacht club facilities can be used by visitors and the yacht club can arrange clearance facilities for a fee. For those who prefer to do the formalities themselves, these can be very time-consuming as the offices are spread out all over town, and the distances are great. Other marinas however may offer transport for clearance.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The bay, around which the city stretches, is sheltered, but very busy with all types of water craft. There is a small marina tucked into a corner of the northern arm of the bay and the yacht club and new marina to the west.</p>
<p>Be careful anchoring here as there are certain spots where anchoring is not permitted. Best to check with the Port Captain as to the best spot. Mooring balls are avaiable to pick up in the bay.</p>

      Does not receive great reviews from cruisers. Good location but small and poor facilities. For latest updates see comments below.
