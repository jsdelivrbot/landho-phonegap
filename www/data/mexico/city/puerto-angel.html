<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not a Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>Report to the port captain whose office is east of the pier, or to the senior officer at the naval post on the beach. </span><span>Bring copies of your passport and ships documentation. The Port Captain is to the right of the cement pier about 40 yards from the beach. To the right of the pier appears to be the easiest place to land your dinghy with the swell running.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is no longer a coffee exporting port, but the harbour is sheltered and there is a concrete pier which was refurbished a few years ago.</p>
<p><span>Take great care when finding a place to moor as the bay is pretty full with moorings for the pangas. These mooring are mostly floating coke bottles, etc. (the typical panga mooring). Be very careful coming in at night as these floating bottles are extremely hard to see. Finding a spot to anchor can be tricky due to lack of available space.</span></p>
<p>This dusty fishing/tourist village has few paved streets and limited amenities, but it has several tranquil beaches and fresh seafood.  Along the beach there are several restaurants and a small naval installation.</p>
