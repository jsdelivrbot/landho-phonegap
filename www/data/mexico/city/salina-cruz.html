<div class="hello"><div><p>Yacht skippers must hire a local ship's agent to handle their port clearance. The agent will also be needed to arrange for a haul out, repairs or diesel fuel.
One agent, who has proved to be good, is Operistmo. Call then on VHF channel 16 or 67 to make arrangements to enter the harbour "for emergency purposes" to avoid any delays.</p>
<p>The offices of Operistmo are located two blocks NW of the inner harbour.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the only port south of Acapulco where a yacht can haul out, and the only one where larger yachts can safely wait for a Tehuantepec gale to pass.</p>
<p>It is less dirty than Lazaro Cardenas and has less shipping traffic.</p>
<p>Yachts entering the outer harbour must proceed directly through the narrow gap in the quay into the inner harbour. Then, turn hard to starboard and berth alongside the high seawall on the SE side. The Navy also use this seawall.</p>
<p>The Port Captain's office is straight ahead in the SE corner of the inner basin.</p>
