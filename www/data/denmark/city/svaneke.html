<div class="hello"><div><p>The outer harbour can get uncomfortable in strong on-shore winds. </p>
<p>The harbour can be entered day or night (weather conditions permitting). </p>
<p>Beware of the compass variations that can occur in this area.</p>
<p>Svaneke Lighthouse is located on Sandkaas Odde and will guide boats in during approach. Steer to the north in the white angle of the harbour light until the harbour's leading lights guide the boat in at 297 degrees. Be careful: If approach is made form due east of the leading lights, boats are led through the skerries at Maageflak SE of the harbour. </p>
<p>Approach is prohibited if a black ball is displayed or 3 vertical red lights ar shinning on the mast north of the harbour. The harbour gate to the inner harbour is closed if a fixed white light is shinning under the lower light of the leading lights. The current in the approach channel is rarely important.</p>
