<div class="hello"><div><p>The approaches from both east or west are attractive. The Svendborg Sund offers fourteen yacht harbours and numerous anchorages, all set in excellent surroundings. The main harbour attracts many classic yachts and old wooden working boats.</p>
<p>The current in the Sund can be strongly influenced by the wind, and usually follows the wind direction in a strong blow. In calmer weather, the current changes every six hours and rarely reaches more than two or three knots.</p>
