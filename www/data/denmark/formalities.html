<div><p>As a member of the European Union, EU regulations apply. Reporting in or out is not normally enforced but occasionally an official (Police) will check that Passports are in order and say that they should be stamped.</p>
<p>It is advisable  that crew members arriving by plane request their passports are stamped at the airport.</p>
<p>Yachts arriving from Greenland, Norway or EU countries, with nothing to declare, do not have to report to Customs on arrival. Others should proceed to a Port of Entry and report to Customs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that duty-free allowances are very small and amounts over this are declarable. Customs do check yachts, so if in doubt it is advisable to report to Customs.</p>
<p>Immigration must be cleared on arrival and departure. A comprehensive list of all safety equipment on board may be requested by Customs.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Prohibited areas are military firing areas, information on which is contained on Danish charts and in the Danish Notices to Mariners. Also marked on Danish charts as restricted are several small uninhabited islands, which are protected areas for seabirds and other wildlife and should not be landed on between 1 April and 1 June. On some of these islands there are signs forbidding landing.</p>
<p><em>Navigation</em>: Shipping traffic between the North Sea and the Baltic is heavy and vessels must use the correct lane in traffic separation zones. These are in operation in the northern part of the Sound between Elsinore and Hälsingborg in Sweden, at the Great Belt between Korsør and Sprogoe by Hatter Barn and the Baltic Sea south of Gedser. In Danish waters the Transit Route for very large vessels runs from the Skaw to the Moen SE light vessel north-east of Gedser. In some areas larger ships on the Transit Route are confined by depths to Deep Water Routes; these can be found in the Great Belt east of Samsoe, along the east coast of Langeland, and north-east of Gedser. Yachts should avoid the Transit and Deep Water Routes as the depth conditions do not allow large vessels much room to manoeuvre. Attention should also be paid to port entry regulations and signs.</p>
<p><em>Fishing</em>: Foreign visitors may only use simple hand gear for fishing. Harpoons, traps and nets are forbidden. Permission should be obtained from the owners of the fishing rights before fishing in rivers or estuaries.</p>
<p>Holding Tanks - whilst Denmark has implemented the recommendaions (with exceptions as listed below), the Danish Sailing Association advise that foreign visitors will not be compelled to have holding tanks. Furthermore, not all Danish harbours have to equipment to pump out tanks.
Exceptions - Boats built before 1st January 1980 do not have to have holding tanks. Boats built after 1st January 1980 but before 1st January 2000 and which are either less than 10.5m LOA or have a maximum beam of less than 2.8m do not have to have a holding tank.
Boats outside the above exemptions, including all boats built after 1st January 2000, must have a holding tank than can be emptied through a deck fitting.
Boats which are required to have holding tanks must empty them either in official places in harbours or outside a 12NM limited from the coast. Boats not required to have tanks may discharge toilets outside a 1NM limited from the coast.</p>
