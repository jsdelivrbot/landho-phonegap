Denmark's connectors have slight differences from those used elsewhere.  While pin diameter and spacing is standard, outlets may have different housing depths which could interfere with standard adaptors<br>
One report says this is due to "childproofing."  Also, Plug C fits into K-type outlets (but not vice versa).
