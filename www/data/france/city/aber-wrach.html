<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is accessible at all states of the tide. There are 80 places for visitors in the marina. The visitors' are generally berthed on the wave breaker; smaller boats inside and larger boats on the outside.</p>
<p>In addition there are a good number of visitors' buoys in the river opposite the marina.</p>
<p>In the season, arriving yachts are met by a harbour boat and escorted to a berth or allocated a bouy (if required).</p>
<p>It may also possible to anchor in the river, but be careful to keep clear of the oyster beds.</p>
<p>Well up river, before the road bridge at Paluden, there are now 20 dumbell moorings for visitors in a very sheltered, and peaceful pool.</p>
