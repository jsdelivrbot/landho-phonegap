<div class="hello"><div><p>There is now a second marina in the heart of Brest, Marina du Chateau,  It is  on the site of the former naval facility and is entered through the large outer harbour. The promenent white-painted spy ship, just inside the outer harbour wall, provides a useful landmark. The entrance into the marina is not easy to identify until well into the outer harbour.</p>
<p>The long established Marina du Moulin Blanc lies 3 miles beyond the commercial ports.</p>
<p>Although further from the city centre, Marina du Moulin Blanc has a more visitor friendly atmosphere and most requirements are either on site or close by. It is also closer to the airport for crew changes.</p>
<p>Yachts must not enter the commercial docks.</p>
