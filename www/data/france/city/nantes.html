<div class="hello"><div><p>It is best to take the whole flood tide to reach the city from St Nazaire.</p>
<p>The left-hand branch of the river leads to the <span>Belon Jetty which is on the port side. The tide run fast here, but mooring is straightforward. There are showers and toilets and security. It is close to the city centre.</span></p>
<p><span>There are no longer any moorings for private boats on the island side. This is reserved for tour boats only.</span></p>
