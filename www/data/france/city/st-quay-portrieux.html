<div class="hello"><div><p>This one of only two all-tide harbours between St Malo and Lezardrieux. It has a modern marina which was created by building huge artificial breakwaters out from the shore. The channel between the mainland and the off-lying reefs creates a strong tidal race and this needs to be taken into account when passage planning.</p>
<p><span><span>Saint-Quay-Portrieux </span>has been a popular seaside resort since the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century, sheltering against the rocky shores of Saint-Brieuc Bay. <span>The drying harbour, known as Portrieux, or Vieux Port (Old Port), and the charming little alleyways tightly packed with cottages, are typical of an authentic Breton harbour.</span></span></p>
<p>Position 48° 38'48"N, 02° 48'57"W (marina entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>In the season, visitors are normally met by the harbourmaster's dory and led to a berth, but if not, then be sure to call on VHF channel 09 before berthing. The marina is very well sheltered and fully proteced from any swell.</p>
<p>It is possible to dry out in the old harbour. This has a fine level bottom of hard sand but is more exposed to winds from the east.</p>
