<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care on approach to keep to the channel. There are large areas of shallow mud banks at low tide.</p>
<p>There is a mooring field east of the marina channel. The buoys are allocated by the marina, so call on channel 09.</p>
<p>A small ferry makes regular trips across to Ile Tudy - a small peninsula well worth visiting.</p>
