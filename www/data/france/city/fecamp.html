<div class="hello"><div><p>Although this port can entered by day or night, access is difficult in onshore winds above F5. Do not attempt to enter if it is above F7.</p>
<p>Once inside the harbour, the marina is immediately to sta'bd in the Avant Port. Berthing anywhere on pontoon C. If staying longer than a couple of days, then locking through to Bassin Berigny would offer a more comfortable berth in strong SW'ly winds. The lock operates HW-0230 to HW+0045mins.</p>
<p>Weather forecast on a screen outside the capitainerie, updated every three hours</p>
<p>The entrance is at chart datum. It is dredged every few years to 1.5m. The shallowest spot is just inside the entrance. Anchoring outside is only advisable in the calmest of conditions.</p>
