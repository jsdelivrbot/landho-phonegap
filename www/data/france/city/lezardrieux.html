<div class="hello"><div><p>Once south of the junction with the Ferlaz Channel, the river offers few opportunities for anchoring. The best spots are full of private moorings and as the tides run hard here, it is important to be out of the main stream. North of Le Croix lighthouse there are several nooks and crannies among the rocks which can be used in reasonably settled weather and with a large scale chart.</p>
<p>The main marina has all tide access and there is a useful waiting pontoon for the inner marina by the northern-most large concrete and white marker in the middle of the river.</p>
<p>The small town of Lezardrieux is about a mile up the hill</p>
<p>The W visitors buoys on the west edge of the chanel N of Perdix are mainly occupied by local residents.   Although some way from Lezardrieux, there is a good beach for landing with pleasant 20min walk past a nature reserve to Lezardrieux.   It is easier than trying to use a dinghy unless you have a powerful outboard.</p>
