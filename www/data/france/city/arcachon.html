<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a dangerous sand bar across the entrance to the bay which moves, and it is essential to ensure it is safe to enter. Although conditions out to sea may be calm, this is not necessarily the situation over the bar.</p>
<p>Call Cap Ferret Signal Station on VHF CH16 or <span>Tel: +33 0556037627 and they will advise if and when it is safe to enter.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Changes to the entrance channel</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_lblBody">The entrance is tricky and has severe tides.<br/>The channel has moved around 300m East. </span></p>
<p><span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_lblBody">Follow the lateral buoys, taking advice from Cap Ferret coastguard as to where in the channel is deepest. The most dangerous stretch is where the channel turns N and swell over the sandbanks is beam on. </span></p>
<p><span>A cruiser report indicates that facilities are in poor condition and that a one night stay is expensive.</span></p>
