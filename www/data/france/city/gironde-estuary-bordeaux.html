<div class="hello"><div><p>The river is best approached just after low water as there can be strong currents at the entrance. Beware of entering in strong on-shore winds with an ebb tide.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the Gironde estuary, are the ports of  <a href="../Royan/"><strong>Royan &amp; Port Medoc</strong></a> One is on the north bank and the other on the south.</p>
<p>Further up the river is the marina at <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/France/Pauillac-Trompeloup?rc=PortProfile"><b>Pauillac</b></a>.</p>
<p>Just by the Aquitaine Bridge there is the small floating pontoon, Halte Nautique de Lormont. This is also a stop for the river taxi.</p>
<p><span>If travelling on up to Bordeaux, there is now a</span> new bridge (named the Chaban-Delmas bridge), over the river. It is a very high vertical lift bridge and its towers are unmistakable. It is here that the entrance to the Bacalan Basin is located on the northern bank of the river.</p>
<p><span>If proceeding further up the river, note the following; </span><span>On reaching the low stone bridge (was 2nd from the ocean) avoid using arches 9/10/11 counting from the west. Arch 1 is on the land with a road running under and is on the right hand side travelling up the river. Big barges use these three arches and have to move at low water because of headroom. There are guard rails to protect the arches and at half tide they are under water which is dangerous. </span><span>Avoid arches 2 and 16 as they are too close to the shore.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note that Halte Nautique de Bordeaux at Le Point du Jour, does not accept visitors and has not done so for many years.</span></span></p>
