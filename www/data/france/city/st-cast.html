<p>St Cast Marina <span>©St Cast Marina</span></p>
<p>The building of a breakwater joining several rocky islets to the existing breakwater, has allowed an all tide marina to be created here.</p>
<p>The bay in front of the town still provides an anchorage, but unless of shoal draft, it is quite a distance from the shore and rather exposed.</p>
<p>The access channel to the marina runs parallel to the extended breakwater. On rounding the head of the breakwater <span>the port entrance is situated between the Bec Rond Rock (+5 metres) and the La Feuillade Rock. To the </span><span>East, a pontoon for fishing boats and three pontoons for large pleasure craft run perpendicular to the </span><span>quay where the port is dredged to a depth of 2.25m below chart datum. To the West, five pontoons, </span><span>with a depth of 1.25m below chart datum, run parallel to the Vallets shore platform.</span></p>
<p>A Cardinal South perch marker marks the southern extremity of the breakwater separating the marina from the swinging moorings to the west, and which is submerged at high water.</p>
<p>In the marina, mooring officers (English speaking) available 7/7 from 08:00 to 21:00 during the season to greet incoming boats and guide them to their berths.</p>
