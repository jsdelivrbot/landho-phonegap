<div class="hello"><div><p>Porto-Vecchio is a ferry port at the southern end of Corsica's est coast.</p>
<p>This is an attractive port with an interesting 'Old Town' with narrow, cobbled streets full of bars, restaurants and historic buildings.</p>
<p>It is a 10 minute (steep) walk up the hill from the marina. There is also an alternative longer, but less testing route up to the town.</p>
<p>Position 41° 35.4'N, 9° 17.1'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>In addition to mooring in the marina, it is possible to anchor, out of the channel, close to the commercial docks, where it is very sheltered.</span></p>
<p>Another anchorage can be found east of the port (41° 35.512'N, 009° 18.072'E) with good holding. Y<span>ou are allowed to tie the dinghy up to the pontoon closest to the marina office.</span></p>
<p><strong>Baie Stagnoli</strong> has good holding but is reported to be often noisy with wet bikes from the afternoon until well into the evening.</p>
<p>Last updated March 2015.</p></div></div>
