<div class="hello"><div><p>This small, historic port has a drying approach, but the marina here is in a non-tidal basin. The lock is open 3 hrs each side of high water. Beware of the training wall by the harbour entrance.</p>
<p>Approach - can be identified by the six 60m tanke-like structures of a nuclear power station and the spire of Petit-Fort-Phillippe.
Entrance dries with variable sandbanks. Do not attempt to pass between the N card bn and E pierhead due to submerged training wall. On entry, keep nearer to the E pier for the first 100m. Without local knowledge access is only possible from HW -0200 to HW, is difficult in fresh onshore winds and should not be attempted in winds over F5. The entrance to the Marina in Bassin Vauban has a single pair of lock gates which are closed at approximately HW+/- 0300 when the depth over the lock sill is about 2m. To enter the canal system at the far end of the basin, 48 hours notice is required and can only be achieved if free flow is possible.</p>
<p>Berthing - Visitors pontoon is the first one immediately starboard after passing the lock gates. The inner end dries to very soft mud, the outer end has 2.5m Contact the harbour for advice. The drying pontoons off Petit-Fort-Phillipe are not for visitors although temporary berth at HW may be possible.
No dedicated waiting pontoon outside the lock.
The Harbour Office is at the top of the letter "n" in Vauban.</p>
