<div class="hello"><div><p><b>NOTE:</b> The marina is closed until August 2016 due to on going work. Also be aware that the migrant crisis here is causing security around the port to be very tight.</p>
<p>The shelter here is very good, especially in the marina at Bassin de l'Ouest. Access is possible at all states of the tide, but in strong NW to NE winds the harbour entrance is rough.</p>
<p>Beware of strong tides and rough seas while crossing the approach channel to Cap d'Antifer oil terminal. The tides, about 1M offshore, between Cap d'Antifer seem to run more strongly than indicated in the tidal stream atlases.</p>
<p>Yachts must have their engine running (even if sailing) when entering or leaving the port. Yachts must monitor VHF channel 17 while transiting the port.</p>
<p>At busy times, the berthing master is on hand to direct yachts to a berth.</p>
<p>If planning to enter the canal, then proceed to the lock at Amere Port  and call on VHF channel 17.</p>
