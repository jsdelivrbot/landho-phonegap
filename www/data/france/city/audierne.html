<div class="hello"><div><p>If the tide is low, or your stop very brief, then the anchorage off Sainte Evette provides shelter in all but on-shore winds from the east. There are visitors' mooring buoys tucked behind the breakwater, or, in settled weather, an anchorage further out.</p>
<p>The marina in Audierne itself is best entered/exited at HW +/-3hrs and the curve of the channel followed closely, using the <strong>two different sets</strong> of leading marks. (The upper mark of the 2nd set is in front of the grey storage shed and not easy to spot). There are rocks to port of the channel, which is dredged and which has a steep-to edge on the sta'bd side.</p>
<p>The marina has developed from the original working fishing harbour and still retains its <code>down to earth</code> atmosphere. Minimum depth is 2m and maximum length is 14m.</p>
<p>The Harbour master is usually about in season and is very helpful with mooring.</p>
<p>Facilities are excellent (code required) and are next to the harbour office. This is accross the road from the marina and to the right (flags outside).</p>
