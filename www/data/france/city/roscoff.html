<div class="hello"><div><p>Roscoff is an attractive little town, perched on a peninsula on the north Brittany coast. It is the home of the original <code>Onion Jonnies</code> and there is a museum here devoted to their activities. Separated from it by a narrow, torturous channel, is the Ile de Batz - a very quiet, laid-back island.</p>
<p>Roscoff is ideally placed for crew changes, with good connections to England and the rest of France.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The newly built marina, just south of the ferry port at Bloscon, is now fully open. It is large and spacious making it a particularly attractive stop for traditional boats. It has a good range of services with more planned.</p>
<p>See photo below showing the entrance via the ferry port. Do not attempt to enter the marina via the southern entrance.</p>

<p>New marina at Roscoff (<i>photo Val Ellis)</i></p>
<p>The old port on the northern side of the town, is a drying harbour, with access about two hours each side of high water. The visitors' berths are alongside the old breakwater. The bottom is sand/mud and small stones. It was designed for fishing vessels, so long lines and protection from the wall is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong><br/> There are about 15 heavy white mooring buoys for visitors on the north side of the Chenal de Batz, just west of the Ar Chaden tower. These are reasonably sheltered except at HW in winds from the North and East.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> There is a sheltered anchorage at Pen Lann, in the Rade de Morlaix, or in the Penze river, west of Ile Callot. Alternatively, many yachts proceed up the river to Morlaix.</p>
