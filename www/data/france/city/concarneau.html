<div class="hello"><div><p>Within the Baie de la Foret are two popular sailing destinations, Port de la Foret and the old town of Concarneau.</p>
<p>La Foret has one of the largest mainas in Brittany and is a safe place to leave a yacht.</p>
<p>Concarneau is a more bustling place and a busy fishing port. Some areas of the port are shallow, so care should be taken when finding a berth.</p>
