<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Marina Puesta del Sol lies on the north Pacific Coast of Nicaragua just south of the Golfo de Fonseca. El Viejo is the nearest large town, about 30 kilometers away.</span></p>
<p>The marina is 10 miles by sea from the major port of Corinto, but some 40 kms over land and is located in a lagoon called El Estero de Aserradores. This lagoon is fed by by two rivers and reached by a deep channel.</p>
<p>The entrance and channel to the marina are well marked with large red and green buoys, although some lights do not work. All buoys display well on radar. The entrance and channel can take drafts up to eight feet at low water (up to 13 feet at medium water).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.marinapuestadelsol.com/"><b>marina website</b></a> lists current waypoints of the approach to the channel and Sea Buoy. The Marina Office monitors Channel 16 and both the Harbourmaster and Marina Owners speak English and can be contacted with questions.</p>
<p><span>Position 12°37'17" N,087°20'30" W.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is an official port of entry and can organise for all officials to visit the marina to facilitate clearance.</p>
<p>If arriving from a foreign port, the Marina will ask for Passports, Zarpe and Crewlist and hold them until government officials arrive. A zarpe will be required from previously visited countries. The Marina will then contact Naval and Immigration Officials, who will respond from Corinto, Nicaragua (About 1.5 hours drive away). Marina Puesta Del Sol has no official Port Captain and the Navy handles the ship's paperwork.</p>
<p>Yachts arriving from Nicaraguan ports do not need to check in.</p>
<p>There are fees here for entry, exit, a tourist card per person, zarpe and sailing permit. Current immigration charges are US$25 per boat for both checking in and out; US$12 per person to check in and US$2 per person to check out; US$25 for an international zarpe; US$15 for a national zarpe; US$11 to Customs.</p>
<p><span>Just beware if you are clearing in here there is no access to an ATM and customs/immigration expects to be paid in either local currency or US$ (exact change for each department).</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Marina Puesta Del Sol is well maintained and is owned by former cruisers. The owners of the facility live on their boat in the marina and frequently socialise with guests.</p>
<p>Security is good and this is a good option for leaving your boat if planning on doing some inland tours of Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Payment of dock fees gives boat crew full hotel privileges, including two pools, restaurant, and tennis courts. The Hotel currently has 20 rooms, with plans to expand in the near future, including an airport, golf course and condos.</p>
<p>The nearest town of Chinandega is good for provisioning or sightseeing (van put on by the marina). The town has several supermarkets and a large market area with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
