<div class="hello"><div><p>Corinto, on Nicaragua's Pacific coast, is the country's largest port and offers an authentic experience of the country. Latitude: 12° 28.56 N Longitude: 87° 10.49 W. Corinto is approximately 14 miles south of Aserradores.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Few boats are stopping into Corinto now that Marina Puesta Del Sol is open for business. The same Port Captain and Immigration Officers process papers at Corinto and at Puesta Del Sol. Therefore if coming from Puesta del Sol checking into Corinto is not needed. </p>
<p>If Corinto is your first port of entry, the port captain’s office will send for officials to give you clearance. It is recommended that you take the initiative to check in with the port captain’s office located near the shipyard’s front gate. Immigration office is in the same building. Clearance is normally quick, effective and reasonable. The total cost of clearing in is around US$25.</p>
<p>Port control keep a 24 hour watch on VHF Channel 16 and should be contacted for instructions concerning clearance. Use the "official" anchorage a few
hundred meters east of the shipyard, near the shrimp boats. Stay clear of
the power plant as they have underwater exhaust and intake pipes.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is recommended that you radio the Port Captain as you approach for
information regarding shipping traffic. The harbor entrance is wide and well
marked with navigational buoys. You must approach via the main channel as
any short cuts are shallow. The main channel is 40 feet deep all the way to
the last buoy, then 12 to 20 feet deep all the way to the bridge, at low
tide. The harbor is protected by a large peninsula that has a lighthouse at
the entrance.</p>
<p><b>Anchorages</b></p>
<p>The inner harbour is well protected. There is a good anchorage off the beach, opposite the distinctive silver fuel tank, in about 10 metres. The holding is good in mud and sand, although this anchorage is sometimes subject to swell at low water.</p>
<p>An alternative, smoother anchorage, is well into the inner harbour at the industrial zone of Estero Grande, near a fleet of ageing fishing boats. Unfortunately, the nearby generating plant rather disturbs the peace and boats her are rather vunerable to theft nor is there any safe place to leave a dinghy while ashore.</p>
<p>Corinto marina, up the river next to the Pasocaballo bridge that connects Corinto to the mainland, used to offer a secure anchorage, dinghy dock and clearance assistance to visiting cruisers. However the marina does not offer these services anymore. It is still possible to anchor here, however you cannot get ashore other than at the town "beach" end.</p>
<p>Ten miles north of Corinto (via sea - about 40 km by land) is Marina Puesta Del Sol, inside the protected estuary and lagoon of Aserradores.</p>
