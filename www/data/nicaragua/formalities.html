<div><p>On approach, call the port on VHF 16 to make arrangements for clearance if arriving from a foreign port.</p>
<p>Clearance must be made with Immigration, Customs, and Port Authorities. A number of ports have no official Port Captain and the Navy handles the ship's paperwork.</p>
<p>Several Nicaraguan ports require a zarpe from the previous Nicaraguan port visited, even when it is only a few miles away.</p>
<p>Ease of clearance and fees charged vary greatly from port to port. Even then, officials never seem to be consistent, so if possible be wary and make contact with cruisers in your intended port of entry prior to arrival to check on the current situation.</p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared. A declaration of money and valuables must be made on arrival.</p>
<p>Canned meats and dairy products are prohibited imports, also medication without accompanying prescriptions.</p>
<p>It has been reported that in San Juan del Sur, Customs have<span> decided that boats are to be allowed 30 days in the country, just like a car, then will be forced to leave or pay import duties. How the import duties are calculated seems to be up to the Customs officer on charge that day. Cruisers planning on staying longer than a month in Nicaragua should determine on checking in exactly how long they are permitted to stay. There is always the option of staying 29 days, leaving for 3 and then returning.</span></p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Nicaragua is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p>

<div><p>The Transporte Acuatico now charges <strong>$50 per month</strong> for permission to navigate in Nicaraguan waters. It does not matter if you are in the water or on the hard, or only in port for one day.  If you do not pay the Port Captain will not allow you a zarpe for exit.<br/> <i>Note however that charging of this fee is inconsistent and can be anything between $20 &amp; $50 and in some ports (Puerta Del Sol, for example), it is not even being charged.</i></p>
<p>Tourist visa per person: US$12.50<br/> Sailing permit (some call this Boat Import): US$25.00<br/> National Exit Zarpe: US$10.00<br/> International Exit Zarpe: US $25-$30</p>
<p>There are reports of an "anchoring fee" being charged in San Juan del Sur (40 cents per foot per day), whether you are on the hard or in the water (see <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Nicaragua/SanJuandelSur">San Juan del Sur</a> for details). However latest reports from visiting cruisers is that this fee is as yet not being charged.</p>
<p><i>Note: Fees tend to vary from place to place for no apparent reason. Some officials may also attempt to solicit bribes.</i></p>
<p>Last updated December 2012.</p>
<p><!-- Info from 2004 which does not appear to be charged now is: Ministry of Finance tax on the vessel, US$15.00 to enter and US$15.00 to exit the country (also applies to persons crossing the border by automobile). --></p></div>
