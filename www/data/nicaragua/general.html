<p>In all of the bigger cities good mobile phone coverage, and next to the main roads more antennas are planted to ensure coverage for the ones on the road. The GSM 1900 network is used in Nicaragua, so be sure to check that your phone supports this system. You can buy a SIM-card in Nicaragua for only a couple dollars, which enables you to have your own Nicaraguan cell phone number and to make local calls charged at local rates.<br/></p>
<p>Internet connections are available in many cities and towns, be it not very fast but the coverage is significant. The government subsidizes internet cafes and internet is consequently available at cheap rates throughout the country.</p>
