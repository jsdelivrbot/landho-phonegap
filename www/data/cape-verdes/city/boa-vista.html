<div class="hello"><div><p>The port of Sal Rei is on the western side of the island.</p>
<p>Anchor east of the small island of Ile de Sal Rei, close to the beach to avoid the worst of the swell. The dinghy can be left at either the fishermen's quay or on the beach. This anchorage is very exposed and rolly and not safe in a southerly.</p>
<p>The island is full of tourists in the season.</p>
