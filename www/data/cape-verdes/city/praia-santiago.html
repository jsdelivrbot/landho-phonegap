<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the largest of the Cape Verde islands and Praia is the capital of the country. The mountains here cause a much higher rainfall than in many of the other islands and it is, therefore, much greener with areas of rain forest. It is an island worth exploring.</p>
<p>Location 14° 54.4'W, 23° 30.2'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruising yachts normally anchor in the bay (see notes in docking).</p>
<p>Formalities are completed at the Immigration office, a 200 metre walk turning right from the fuel station, right by the large harbour gates. Photographs of each crew member, or photocopies of the relevant page in the passport, will be needed. Photocopies can be made at a small kiosk opposite the immigration office.</p>
<p>The Port Captain's office is located on the western side of the harbour, near the rebuilt dock. The ship's papers will be kept there until one's departure, however they will accept a laminated copy. There is a 496 C.V. escudos port fee (1 euro = 110 CV escudos). There are no immigration fees.</p>
<p>Clearance for next port (internal or external) 500 C.V.E. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are seveal anchorages here, but it is reported that the water quality is very bad. The pollution is caused by a sewer opening into the river at the head of the bay. If you use a watermaker then purification is essential.</p>
<p>Up to 2m of swell can appear in this harbour from the south, making the anchorage uncomfortable, or sometimes, untenable. The bottom is soft mud, making the holding poor.</p>
<p>Dinghy landing is possible in the fishing harbour, or at the newly rebuilt dock by the harbour police. </p>
<p>This island has a very bad reputaion for theft. Be sure to keep the decks clear and lock up both your boat and dinghy. Also, beware pickpockets working in teams.</p>
