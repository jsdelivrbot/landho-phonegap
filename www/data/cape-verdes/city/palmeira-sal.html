<div class="hello"><div><p>Palmeira lies on the western side of the island of Sal, on the north shore of a large bay. Sal is 40nm north of Boa Vista and is one of the most tourist-orientated of the cape Verde islands.</p>
<p>Due to the prevailing winds, the Palmeira anchorage is generally very sheltered. It has been reported to be a very hospitable harbour, however dinghy and outboard theft can be a problem here.</p>
<p>Position 16°45'02"N, 22°59'00"W (anchorage)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a Port office and Police office near the dinghy dock.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may be necessary to visit the offices at the international airport and complete formalities there. To avoid waiting too long, go early in the morning or mid afternoon when most flights have left.</p>
<p>The ship's papers will be held until departure.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A new breakwater extension has been completed here and a new deep water buoyed chanel has been established. At present all  the lights are functioning. This developement is not on the latest charts or pilots and care is needed, especially if entering at night.</p>
<p>The best anchorage is in Baia da Palmeira at 16° 45'N, 22° 59.2'W in about 4m of water over thin sand (not a good anchorage in a strong southerly). Not advisable to enter at night because of the various wrecks, and also the  lighthouse might not be working.</p>
<p>Bahia da Mordeira, south of Palmeira, is also a good, sheltered anchorage.</p>
<p><span>Noonsite continues to receive reports of dinghy and outboard thefts here, so usual security precautions should be taken to prevent theft from yachts (hoisting) and stolen dinghies/outboards (good chains and locks).</span></p>
