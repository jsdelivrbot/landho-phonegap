<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This mountainous island lies about 70nm due west of Sal. <span>Tarrafal is l</span></span><span>ocated on the west coast of the island. It is one of the only places on the island with a (black) sand beach. <span>The peaks cause sufficient rainfall to support the growing of fruit and vegetables here.</span></span></p>
<p>Position 16° 34'07"N, 24° 21'41"W (anchorage).</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Pretty anchorage although select a spot to anchor with care; too far south and the swell causes severe rolling; too far north and the bottom is rocky with poor holding. The water is reported to be very clear here, more than 10 metres.</p>
<p>One of the best islands to visit. Friendly people and few security problems. A Dutch ex-pat living on the island  is a good contact.</p>
<p>Some shopping is possible ashore at a fresh produce market. Water from a tap (erratic) on the shore. Fuel by jerry jug from the service station.</p>
