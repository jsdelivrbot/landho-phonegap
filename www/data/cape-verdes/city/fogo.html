<div class="hello"><div><p>On the west coast of the island there is now a small port, north of Sao Filipe, where it might be possible to berth or anchor.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage south of the port in 4m of water, over sand, but the holding is not too good and it is wise to leave someone on board when going ashore.</p>
