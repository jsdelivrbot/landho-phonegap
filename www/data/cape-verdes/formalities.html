<div><p><strong>On Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Report to the Port Captain on arrival at one of the Ports of Entry. Visiting Customs is only required if you have dutiable goods or pets on board.</p>
<p>Visas are no longer necessary for visiting yachts arriving for short stays (see <strong>Immigration</strong> section below for more details). Generally, formalities appear to have been simplified in an effort to attract more cruising boats to visit the archipelago. The ship’s papers will be retained by the Authorities, but passports just have to be stamped and are then returned.</p>
<p><strong>Cruising the Islands</strong></p>
<p><span>At subsequent ports, yachts must report to the port captain on arrival and departure. This is realatively straightforward in most ports, although cruisers have reported authorities to be very slow in Sal.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Permits are no longer necessary to visit Fogo and/or Brava islands. </span></span></p>
<p><strong>On Departure</strong></p>
<p><span>On leaving the county, Immigration must be visited. </span><span>There is a fee for clearing out irrespective of the length of your stay. This is payable to the Capitania and is separate to any berthing/anchoring fees.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Yachts cannot officially leave the country from <span>Fogo or Brava, </span>and must return to Praia, Sal or Mindelo to collect the ship’s papers and clear out.</p>

<p><b>Air Travel</b></p>
<p>If <b>leaving </b>or<b> joining a boat</b> in the Cape Verdes you<b> do need </b>to have a visa.</p>
<p>It is much better to have arranged a visa in advance to avoid long queues, however, a visa can be arranged locally on arrival at the airport or on departure at the Port Immigration (not at the airport).</p>

<div><p><span>Medical facilities in Cape Verde are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. The largest hospitals are in Praia and Mindelo, with smaller medical facilities and clinics located throughout the country. Medical facilities are particularly limited on the island of Boavista. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão no longer have functioning airports, so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is extremely difficult from these two islands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </b>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to the CDC’s dedicated website if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p>
<p><span>Cases of locally transmitted Zika virus have been confirmed in the last 3 months. Discuss your travel plans with your healthcare provider, particularly if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</span></p></div>
