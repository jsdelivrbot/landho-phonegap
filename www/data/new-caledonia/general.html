<div><p>International Dialing Code for New Caledonia is +687.</p>
<p>New Caledonia has a modern satellite communications system allowing direct calls overseas. Most places have mail, internet and telephone facilities.</p>
<p><strong>New Caledonia Internet</strong><br/> Access to the Internet is easy in Noumea, where there are numerous Internet Cafes. The Rocket Guide to New Caledonia includes the locations of the most popular Internet Cafes. The cost of Internet in New Caledonia is very high, between 500 and 1000 cfp per hour, and the "high speed" connections are miserably slow compared to broadband connections in other countries.</p>
<p>OPT, the New Caledonia telecom service, has a "Carte iZi" that lets you log onto the Internet with a special number from any phone at all - including mobile phones or hotel phones. This is the most economical way to get connected to the Internet in Noumea (4.5 cfp per minute). The connection however is reported to be painfully slow.</p>
<p><strong>SSB<br/></strong><span>See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Members/doina/R2004-03-30-3/">Pacific List of Radio Nets</a></b><br/> The Namba Net operates now on 8101 because 6 megs became too noisy. It is at 0815 hrs local time for vessels cruising New Caledonia and Vanuatu.</p>
<p><span>Please note that the Namba net only operates when there are sufficient cruisers prepared to act as net controllers. Ideally 7 people but it usually starts with 4. It starts usually sometime in June and finishes in October. The 8 meg frequency covers Vanuatu. New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and the Louisaides.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Phones</strong><br/> GSM mobile phones work almost everywhere near population centres throughout New Caledonia. The Rocket Guide to New Caledonia includes a coverage map and full details of mobile phone use.</p>
<p>International roaming is available from most countries so your normal mobile phone and telephone number should work in New Caledonia. Ask your GSM provider before you leave to arrange for roaming in New Caldeonia.</p>
