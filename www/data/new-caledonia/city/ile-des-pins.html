<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at Kuto Bay has excellent holding, good protection from south-easterly and easterly winds and offers easy access to a few basic facilities and provisions.</p>

<p>Kuto Peninsula :© <span>Dorothy &amp; Steve Darden</span></p>
<p>The nearby anchorage at Kanumera Bay, although smaller than Kuto, is even more picturesque, with fine snorkeling along its outer margins.</p>
<p>Neither bay offers good protection in a strong southwesterly. In these conditions it is best to seek shelter on the north and east sides of the island.</p>
<p>Facilities are concentrated around Kuto, where dinghies, as well as shallow-drafted boats, may come alongside the visitors dock. Good provisioning is available locally, as well as bank, telephones and fuel (by jerrycan).</p>
