<div class="hello"><div><p>Lifou is the principal island of the Loyalty Group, and is a nice stopover on the route from Port Vila to Noumea.</p>
<p>We, the island's capital is on the East coast, and is most convenient for boats coming from that direction and those on course from Vanuatu to New Caledonia. There is a new marina here.</p>
<p>The North and West sides offer beautiful sandy beaches and good snorkeling. The local people are friendly and make you feel welcome.</p>
