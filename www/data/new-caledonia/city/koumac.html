<div class="hello"><div><p>Koumac is the last substantial settlement on the NW coast of New Caledonia, and is a good base from which to explore the Northern Lagoon. It has the only good marina on the west coast outside of Noumea, albeit a very small one. This marina has restricted access so permission to enter should be confirmed prior to arrival (details below).</p>
<p>The town offers a wide range of services and it is possible to provision adequately here before a passage north.</p>
<p>Position: <span>20° 58.02S 164° 27.33 E (Marina)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is no longer a port of entry, however it may be possible to leave the boat in the marina and take the bus to Noumea for clearance. Check first with Customs that this option is legal.</p>
<p>Skippers should report to the Port Captain (Capitaine de Port) on arrival, located in the marina.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is about 3 km away from the town (half an hours walk) sitting on the southern end of the Pandop peninsula.</p>
<p>The entrance to the marina is shared with the commercial side of the port and is very narrow. It requires careful manoeuvuring in tight quarters and care should be taken on entering and exiting. If at all uncertain, it is recommended to continue past the marina entrance in a north easterly direction towards <span>Anse de Koumac</span>, anchor off the beach and take the dinghy into the marina from there to familiarise yourself with the layout of the entrance and space available.</p>
<p>The marina is small and access is restricted. Yachts must have permission to enter from the Port Captain prior to coming into the marina. Either call on VHF Ch. 67 or telephone the marina. You will be required to speak French.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor off the beach at <span>Anse de Koumac</span>, just a short distance north east of the marina entrance.</p>
