<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Noumea is located on the south western tip of the main island and is the capital of New Caledonia. It is the only official Port of Entry. </span></p>
<p><span>The city offers plenty of services for cruising boats with a good boatyard at Nouville Plaisance and marinas in Port Moselle and Baie de L'Orphelinat. Cruisers have reported however that finding space in marinas for anything more than a few days, and boatyards for hard standing, is very difficult, and booking well in advance is advised.</span></p>
<p><span><span>This is a busy military, shipping and cruise liner harbour.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="Countries/NewCaledonia/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>New Caledonia/Formalities</strong></a> page for detailed information on Clearance, Immigration  and Customs.</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong><br/>On approaching Noumea, call Port Moselle Marina or Port du Sud marina on channel 67, giving the vessel name, length and last port of call and  stating that you would like to clear in when possible. The Q flag and a French  courtesy flag should be flown.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong><br/>Berth at the visitor pontoon (marked with a yellow cross) at Port Moselle marina or at Port du Sud marina,  or anchor just outside Port Moselle (out of the shipping channels) and dinghy into the marina office, who will  give you instructions as to what to do next.</p>
<p>If arriving at night, anchor in the anchorage in Baie de Moselle, outside the  marina breakwater. Take care, as there are often many unlit boats anchored in  the bay.</p>

      The Yacht Club no longer offers docking facilities to visitors (December 2007) as its facilities are too overcrowded. Members of foreign yacht clubs can, as a transit visitor, have access to all the CNC member's facilities (bar, restaurant, internet). For a fee of 3.200 CFP cruisers can use the dinghy dock, hot showers, garbage and water access. The staff speak English and are very helpful, mail can be sent to their address and will be held for your arrival. The club is quite a way from the city centre but there are buses. There is a commercial centre nearby with supermarket, restaurants, hairdresser, shoe repairer, pharmacy, bank, post office, Shell station etc.
