This is a rugged coastline with incredible rock formations, many resembling well known icons (such as the "Nesting Chicken", la poule couveuse and the sphinx that form the headlands of the Hienghene harbour).</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring in the river is no longer possible here, so boats must use the marina which is only possible for shallow-draft vessels. There is however a deep water anchorage outside the entrance with easy access to "the Hen" - good except in N winds. As you are close to the entrance of the Hienghene River it is prudent to show anchor nights at light.</p>
