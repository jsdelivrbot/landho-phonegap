	        </h1>
<h2 id="Clearance">
                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><span>All yachts arriving in New Caledonia should proceed to <strong>Port Moselle, <span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/NewCaledonia/Noumea">Nouméa</a></span>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>All entry formalities are now only handled in Nouméa. Yachts are not permitted to stop or anchor anywhere in New Caledonian territorial waters before having visited </span><span>Nouméa </span><span>and completed formalities. However, if arriving after dark you are allowed to anchor in the authorised anchorages outside the entrance to the marina until the morning.</span></p>
<p><span><span>It is no longer possible to complete clearance formalities at We on Lifou Island (Loyalty Islands). It can however be "arranged" at a cost (see <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/NewCaledonia/LifouIsland"><b>Lifou</b></a> for more details).</span></span></p>
<p><strong>On Arrival</strong><br/> Fly the yellow pratique flag and the French courtesy flag on entering New  Caledonian waters.</p>
<p><span>Switch to VHF channel 16. At the approaches to Port Moselle, switch to channel 67 and call the Harbour Master' office.</span></p>
<p>All crew must remain on board until clearance has been completed. You can either go alongside the marina's quarantine dock (assuming there is room), or anchor out (outside the shipping channels) and dinghy into the marina to complete clearance. The latter may be quicker as you can start early and complete clearance in one day - important when crew can only go ashore once you have cleared-in.</p>
<p>The marina office will give you a map directing you to all the official offices. There are four governmental offices you will have to visit. They are all within walking distance and should take approx. an hour to complete. Some cruisers take their dinghy to the north end of the bay/port and have a crew member tend the dinghy while they visit the nearby clearance offices.</p>
<p><span>The Immigration office, which is near the cruise ship wharf, will need to be visited both inbound and when departing. </span>They are only open until 1130 so visit them first. You will be asked to fill out a form and sign a register.</p>
<p>At Customs (open 0730-1130, 1230-1630 Monday to Thursday, and until 1400 on Friday) it is the same procedure. Ensure that the boat is placed in the Temporary Duty-free Import scheme (IFT).</p>
<p>Quarantine/Biosecurity are the only officials who are likely to want to come to the boat (if at anchor you will have to take them in your dinghy). They will check the boat and may confiscate food items (as outlined below). If at anchor, b<span>ring all of your forbidden foods ashore with you in plastic bags for disposal. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Quarantine / Biosecurity<br/></strong></span>BE WARNED: New Caledonia has strict quarantine regulations. Not only will the majority of your food (including frozen food) be confiscated, but all products of animal or vegetable origin, as well as items such as bikes that may be stained with soil, must be kept on board. See further details below under Customs.</p>
<p>Since April 2010 the quarantine clearance arrangements at Port Moselle for pets on board are  uncertain as the building housing their office was demolished and the new  one still under construction. See <a href="Members/sue/R2010-08-05-2"><strong>report</strong></a> by cruisers who  arrived with a dog July 2010, as to how the situation was then. Updates from cruisers arriving here with pets would be welcome.</p>
<p><strong>On Departure</strong><br/>On departure, Customs, Immigration, and the Port Captain have to be visited. Those planning to leave during the weekend must clear out on Friday. Port fees for 30 days (minimum length of stay) are payable when clearing out of the country with customs. There are no immigration charges when exiting.</p>
<p>Passports of all crew are requested by both Customs and Immigration, and Immigration will also want to see the outward tickets (or photocopies) of crew leaving by air.</p>
<p>Start early as the Port Captain (last person to visit) closes at 1100.</p>
<p>It is also now possible to clear out of any port that has a Customs office (i.e.  any port where they ship minerals), but it must be arranged beforehand with the  Immigration officials in Noumea.</p>
<p>Clearance permits 3 days after your stated departure date in which to exit New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary to apply for a permit to visit the Loyalty Islands or Isle of Pines. On making outward clearance in Noumea, you must request such a visit a few days before leaving and the clearance will be stamped. Whilst there are reports of yachts staying up to two weeks in these Islands, normally a 24 hour stop is permitted.</p>
<p><span>In order to obtain duty free fuel, ask for a paper from Customs when you check-out stating how many litres of petrol and diesel you want (better to over-estimate). It's also possible to shop duty free with your check-out papers in town.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>Customs Rules</strong></p>
<p>The maximum period a yacht may stay before becoming eligible for import duty is six months - or one year if no visit has been made in the previous 3 years. A six month cruising permit is granted on arrival. This relates to the boat only and crew must conform with existing visa requirements.</p>
<p>If the owner has to leave the country, the boat can be placed under the Custom's 'Private Warehouse' scheme for a maximum of 12 months during which time is cannot be used or moved. The limitation on the yacht's stay in new Caledonia is suspended during this time. See www.douane.gouv.ne for the necessary form. Safety and maintenance inspections can be made during storage if Customs are advised in advance.</p>
<p>All items belonging to the crew are permitted to be brought in duty free.</p>
<p>Foreign vessels may now import spare parts and equipment free of duty, but the formalities must be completed at customs in advance, either by the owner or the repair yard. Similar formalities will allow the purchase of duty-free fuel on departure.</p>
<p>Firearms are bonded by customs until departure.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine</strong></p>
<p>New Caledonia has strict quarantine regulations. Not only will  the majority of your food (including frozen food) be confiscated, but all  products of animal or vegetable origin, as well as items such as bikes that may  be stained with soil, must be kept on board. All such items must be declared to the Quarantine officer (SIVAP - Inspection  sanitaire aux frontières).</p>
<p>The following food items will be confiscated: delicatessen meats, fresh/frozen  meat, eggs &amp; dairy produce, honey, fresh fruit &amp; vegetables. Goods are taken  regardless of origin (even if purchased in New Caledonia on an earlier visit)  and the boat is likely to be searched for them. <strong>It is therefore best to  arrive with as little fresh and frozen food as possible.</strong></p>
<p>You are now allowed to keep meat purchased in Canada, Denmark, French Polynesia,  Ireland (Rep. of), New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, U.S.A. or Vanuatu - providing it  has the necessary New Caledonian certificate. It is best to have New Zealand  meat packaged by a butcher with New Zealand Export Quality Labels.</p>

<div><p>For a stay of less than 2 months, on condition that the yacht remains at anchor after customs formalities are completed, animals can be confined onboard.  A special form needs to be filled in, which can be obtained by email from Veterinary Services (see below).</p>
<p>On departure the animal's owner must inform the authorities, who will carry out an inspection.</p>
<p>For stays exceeding 2 months, or if the yacht comes to a berth or is on the hard, the animal must be put into quarantine, provided it has been in the Pacific for the past 6 months. Animals other than cats and dogs will not be allowed to remain onboard but must be destroyed or taken immediately out of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs from rabies-free countries are allowed to be temporarily imported but must spend one week (5 days) in quarantine. The cost is 13,500 PCF.</p>
<p>New Regulations in New Caledonia for importing your dog/pet came into affect on 15th July, 2011 and all pets must complete a 10 day quarantine onboard. Contact Biosecurity who will come to your boat and check your pet out. Also  contact a local vet who must then certify their visits as the first and last day of the quarantine. In between, the Regulations say the boat must stay in the bay of Noumea. Once cleared-in, New Caledonia is very pet friendly.</p>
<p>(Advisable to contact the a vet in advance so you make sure every day in Noumea counts towards your 10 day quarantine).</p>
