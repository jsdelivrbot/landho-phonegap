            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Kenya has some 300 miles of coastline made up of beaches, mangrove swamps and creeks. Much of the coast is protected by coral reefs, which provide excellent diving, while the beaches are reputed to be the best in Africa.</li>
<li>The most popular base for visiting yachts is Kilifi, north of Mombasa, where good repair facilities are available and a yacht can be left in reliable hands, while touring the interior. Facilities in Mombasa, Kenya's chief port, are more limited.</li>
<li>Although slowly improving, yachting facilities are still limited. However, provisioning is generally good and less expensive than the Indian Ocean islands. Diesel and LPG are also reasonably priced. </li>
<li>There is a problem of theft in some places and outboard engines, dinghies and any loose equipment should be put away or watched carefully, except in the few places where security is provided. In some places for a minimal charge one can employ a guard for the night.</li>
<li>The lights and buoys on the coast cannot be relied upon and entry anywhere is not advisable at night.</li>

<div><p>The climate on the coast is tropical and hot. April to June is called the season of long rains, October to November the season of short rains. The weather is under the influence of the monsoons, which also dictate the direction of the currents. This must be borne in mind when planning a cruise along this coast as the best period for southbound voyages is during the NW monsoon and for northbound voyages during the SE monsoon.</p>
