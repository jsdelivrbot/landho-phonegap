<div class="hello"><div><p>Mombasa is Kenya's second largest city and one of Africa's major tourist destinations. The City retains many of its cultural traditions to former Portuguese, Arab and British settlers - all of which have left a lasting influence on the City's food, architecture and people.</p>
<p>The bulk of the city is located on Mombasa Island, which is separated from the mainland by two creeks; Tudor Creek and Kilindini Harbour. The Island is connected to the mainland by the Nyali Bridge, the Likoni Ferry and Makupa Causeway.</p>
<p>Fort Jesus was built by the Portuguese in 1593 and sits on a ridge of coral near the entrance to the old harbour.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Proceed into the harbour, or call port control on VHF Channel 12 or 16 beforehand. Sometimes one is asked to wait at the first buoy for a pilot boat, although the entrance is simple and a pilot is hardly necessary.</p>
<p>There are two places in Mombasa where clearance is possible. Formalities appear to be simpler at the Old Port, on the northern side of Mombasa Island, where officials are more efficient than those at Kilindini Harbour, which is the main commercial port. While clearing, one can anchor beyond the port building among the dhows. At the Old Port a launch may come out with the officials. If no one comes, the captain should go ashore and report first to Customs and then Immigration. Customs and Immigration offices are by the jetties, which are used by small local freighters and dhows. The officials at the Old Port do not work at weekends or on holidays when it is necessary to go to Kilindini Harbour. Here it is best to proceed to the police pontoon, where one can be cleared by Customs, Health and Immigration.</p>
<p>Those who need a visa will have to go to the Immigration office in town, where a three-month visa is easily obtained, renewable for another three months. The visa is payable in US dollars.</p>
