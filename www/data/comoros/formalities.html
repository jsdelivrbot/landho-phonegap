            </h2>
<div><p><span>Since visits by private yachts are rare here, it is recommended that you connect in<span> advance with an agent who can help you navigate the clearance process without issue. Give the agent </span>p</span>rior notice of arrival so they can "prepare" the officials accordingly.</p>
<p><span>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Comoros?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong> for details.</span></p>
<p><span>Begin contacting the “brigade du port” (Port Captain) on VHF 16 on approach. Their VHF is limited and they may not answer until you are quite close. Be ready to use French.</span></p>
<p>Authorities prefer that yachts do not anchor out, but instead come directly to the dock at the Port Captain's office.</p>
<p><span>The agent will greet the yacht at the dock and officials will board the boat.</span></p>
<p>Offices are only closed on Sundays. Clearance is supposed to be available at any time, but in practice it is advisable to ensure daylight arrival.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>There are officially no overtime fees, however some cruisers have reported being asked for these when arriving on a Sunday or at night. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Comoros?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a> </strong>for details of clearance costs.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="resolveuid/82d49e51819845518afbc8aa4419d4f7/@@images/image/preview"/>At <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Comoros/Mutsamudu">Mutsamudu</a></strong>, you will be expected to tie up against the old tugboat in front of the Port Captain's office for clearance immediately, even if you arrive at night<i> (see photo courtesy of SV Totem - September 2015)</i>. Expect to be boarded and searched. It might be wise to hide valuables such as laptops and phones.</p>
<p>The Port Captain here will issue domestic clearance to Moheli at no charge.</p>
