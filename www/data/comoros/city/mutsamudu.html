<div class="hello"><div><p>After clearance it is best to anchor off and to always have somebody on board. <span>Maketse can provide a reliable guard. When going ashore, it is advisable to lock the boat and just leave food and water for the guard.</span></p>
<p><span>Even in calm weather, there is a slight swell in the anchorage here. </span></p>
