<div class="hello"><div><p>International clearance is not possible here.</p>
<p>It is however necessary to "check-in" domestically here if arriving from another island. There is a Port Captain here.</p>
<p><span>Most cruisers visiting Moheli from Anjouan in 2015 were visited by officials requesting they make clearance and pay fees. Be prepared to show you passports, crew lists, and provide a copy of the Mutsamudu clearance. </span></p>
<p><span>There should not be however any fees to pay and a visit to the port captain is not necessary. Cruisers have reported that r</span><span>equesting local officials contact their counterparts in Mutsamudu for clarification, ended any requests for clearance/fees. </span></p>
<p><span>Officials are unlikely to speak English and may feel intimidating; much of this is just cultural.</span></p>
<p><b>Moheli Marine Park</b></p>
<p><span>Many yachts visit Moheli for the marine park along the south coast. Yachts are permitted to go directly to the marine park after clearing at a port of entry and do not need to clear with officials in Fomboni. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span> It is likely you will be visited by officials at the marine park who will want to see your clearance papers and will likely make a phone call to confirm.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a jetty here, near the airport, accessible from the natural bay just east of Fomboni.</p>
<p><span>Do not anchor off the old jetty in the main town; the bottom is terrible and you'll be told to move to the new anchorage anyway.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>The holding in the anchorage is good in sand and mud, although the swell is continual and uncomfortable as this is an open roadstead.</p>
