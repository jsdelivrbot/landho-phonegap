<p>Cell phones in Comoros are rapidly overtaking land phones as many cellular phones now provide Internet access and cell phone computers. SMS, MMS and broadband are becoming standard features on cell phones.</p>
<p><span>Comoros Telecom is a government run monopoly. A SIM card was 4,000 CF in 2015. Additional data, cost per GB, decreases with each additional purchase; about $50 for 8 GB in August 2015.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span>Note that VOIP services can deplete pre-paid data plans by as much as 100 times the expected rate, as the telecom monopoly tries to steer users to long-distance calling instead. So don’t use Skype, Facetime, etc. or buy data in small increments so any “surprise” drop in data doesn’t cost you too much.</span></p>
