<p>Take the dinghy to the dock near the “Pointe du Bout”, walk 50m to the marina office, all you have to do is fill out the form on the dedicated computer, print it, the lady in charge will chop it – done! No Customs officer, no Immigration officer, no fee, nothing. Same for exit. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Many yachts anchor in the bay but there is also a very small marina east of Pointe du Bout.</p>
<p>This is a nice bay with excellent holding and not too crowded.</p>
<p>The resort complex surrounding this marina offers various repair facilities, chandleries and supermarkets.</p>
<p>There is a small boat pontoon in the NE part of the bay.</p>
<p><b>Security</b><br/>An outboard engine, padlocked to the dinghy which was locked to a yacht, was stolen in this bay July 2016. See report adjacent.</p>
