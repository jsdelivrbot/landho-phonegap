<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <a href="Countries/Martinique?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/Martinique/Formalities</strong></a> page for full details.</p>
<p><span>Clearance is possible at the marina office at one of the 4 computers and is as relaxed as elsewhere in the French islands. Fast and efficient. This office is open in the mornings. </span><span>Unless intending to use the marina, arriving boats usually anchor and take their dinghy to one of the marina pontoons.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively yachts can anchor at St Anne where there is a clearance computer terminal at the "Snack Boubou" next to the church (see recommendation below in comments). </span></span><span>Be careful at the dinghy pontoon here and be sure to use a stern anchor or lift the front out to prevent it from sliding under.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care when navigating the channel into the lagoon as it has many twists and turns. <strong>Note</strong>: Buoyage is IALA-B (red to sta'bd).</p>
<p>There is a great anchorage just round the Pointe Marin, in the mangroves. A bit tricky to enter, with a short but winding channel surrounded by shallows (and a small yacht wreck to show in the middle), but well worth it. Very good holding, totally protected from all sides, and calm. There is room for no more than 2 or 3 yachts.</p>
<p>The yacht harbour here is one of the largest in the Caribbean with 650 berths. Staff are bilingual. Whilst 220vt electricity is included in the berthing fee, water is reported to be expensive. WiFi is charged as extra. Pontoon gates are controlled by key card, however they are seldom closed, so security is not ideal. Be sure to secure anything left on deck and your dinghy and associated gear at all times.</p>
<p>Stocking up on provisions is very easy here, with some good supermarkets and a great range of produce.</p>
<p><span>A less-crowded anchorage can be found off nearby St. Anne (where clearance is also possible). St. Anne is a pretty little town, and it's easy to catch a bus into Marin for provisioning.</span></p>
