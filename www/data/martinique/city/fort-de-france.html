<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts should anchor away from the ferry dock as this area just off the town is very busy with ferries.</p>
<p><span>The Fort de France anchorage is a lovely anchorage under the old fort and the town is historic and quaint. There are large malls a short bus ride away providing a selection of products unavailable elsewhere in Caribbean in such variety.</span></p>
<p>Watch out if leaving your dinghy at the dinghy dock. <span>The area is very popular for youngsters to dive and swim, especially after school, on weekends and holidays. Local</span><span> youths are known to use unattended dinghies as diving platforms and in some instances flipping over the dinghies and drowning the outboard (see comment posted June 2015 on the main </span><a href="Countries/Martinique"><strong>Martinique page</strong></a><span>).</span></p>
<p><span>There is an alternative option for your dinghy in town, <span>on the concrete wall just 50m west of the swimming dock. It has three ladders, about 2 metres high for convenient access to the concrete apron on shore. A stern anchor is recommended here as there are wake induced surges in this harbour. </span><span>There are no swimmers in this area however it is recommended you secure the dinghy and outboard plus all loose objects in the dinghy and remove anything of value.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a prohibited anchoring area in front of the southern tip of the Fort St. Louis peninsula</span></span></p>
<p>Yachts can also anchor <span>in the north-east part of the bay or at any of the villages across the bay and take a ferry into town.</span></p>
<p><span>It may be possible to find a free visitor's mooring.</span></p>
