<div class="hello"><div><p>Once the economic capital of the French West Indies, St Pierre was practically destroyed by a volcanic eruption a hundred years ago.  Once described as a small Paris, it is now a peaceful little community on the NW coast of the island. Cute town to visit, and nearby are a couple of nice distilleries. The diving is good here too.</p>
<p><span>Position 14.44°N, 61.11°W (anchorage)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <a href="Countries/Martinique?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/Martinique/Formalities</strong></a> page for full details.</p>
<p>Customs clearance can no longer be done at Le Escapade. You must go to the Tourism Office (although be aware that many locals don't know about this and might tell you to return to Fort de France).</p>
<p>To get to the Tourism office, turn left off the dinghy dock and walk along past the laundrette, then climb the steep steps to the old battlements. At the top the Tourism Office is diagonally across the road to your left. They do not speak English, however you might get lucky and find an English speaking person present. The Customs hours are 0900-1400 local time.</p>
<p>An alternative for clearance when the Tourism office is closed is the clearance computer terminal <span>at the restaurant L'Alsace A`Kay. Turn right off the main dock and it is on the left approx. one block away. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is principally an anchorage. <span>There is reported to be good holding in sand in 10-30', either north or south of the town dock. </span><span>The shore is fairly steep-to, so you will need to anchor close to the beach to find a depth of less than 10 to 12m.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>The substantial town pier/dock is used by charter boats and ferries most of the time. It may be possible to use the pier for a short period of time for loading/unloading. It can be used for dinghys but be sure to u<span>se an anchor to prevent it from going under the pier.</span></p>
<p><span>The 1902 volcanic eruption sank 12 ships at anchor, which is now a dedicated marine park and is marked by 4 large yellow buoys. </span><span>No anchoring is permitted within this area, only use of the free public moorings while diving.</span></p>
<p>Shopping is good for the size of the town, but technical services for yachts is limited. <span>Fresh water taps on the dock are planned, as is better Wi-Fi in the anchorage. </span></p>
