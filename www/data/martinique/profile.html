<li>Martinique is an Overseas Department of France and is the main island of the French Antilles, the most northerly of the Windward Islands.</li>
<li>It has a high standard of yachting facilities and for boats arriving from across the Atlantic, Cul-de-Sac Marin is the most convenient port at which to clear in. There is now a large charter base there.</li>
<li>Cruising attractions include the French culture, mountainous interior and numerous quiet anchorages.</li>

<div><p><span>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general (as well as ashore). Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. </span></p>
<p><span>Dinghy and outboard thieves operate throughout the Caribbean (Sainte Anne - on the SE corner of Martinique - is a well known hot spot) and best advice is to place your dinghy and outboard on deck and chain both overnight. Be careful carrying money ashore and showing cash when buying in public places. </span></p>
<p><span>Latest security report was a stolen outboard that was secured to the dinghy, from a yacht in Anse Mitan, at the beginning of July 2016. See report adjacent.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</strong> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</strong> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></strong></p>

      yachties and locals are collaborating to launch an English-language VHF cruisers radio net in Martinique (Le Marin &amp; St. Anne) soon. The purpose of the Martinique Cruisers Net is to welcome visiting yachts, promote safety and security, share useful information about the island, provide answers to FAQ’s and open a channel for social interaction and cruiser activity planning. Multiple English-speaking net controllers have volunteered - cruisers, tourism office representatives and members of the local business community.
