<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit andcredit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p></div>

<p>If you buy a mobile phone sim card in one of the other East Caribbean islands, the supplier (either Digicel or Cable and Wireless) should set it to roaming, otherwise it won't work in Martinique or Guadeloupe.</p>
<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/><span>Anyone cruising using Digicel should be aware that if you purchase a SIM card in one country, it cannot be topped up in different one, as previously possible. So if you wish to use the sim bought here while cruising in other countries, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or set up an account and do it online.</span><br/><span>You can top-up Digicel at </span><a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p>
<p>Cell phone coverage is available everywhere on Martinique, but you will want to check with your cellular service provider to be sure they offer international coverage and that your cell phone supports service from the caribbean. Check rates.</p>
<p>Telecoms are improving fast but it can prove frustrating when trying to phone home or arrange travel etc.</p></div>
