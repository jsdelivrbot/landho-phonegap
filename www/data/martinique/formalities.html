            </h2>
<div><p>Fly the French courtesy flag (not the Martinique one).</p>
<p>Boats must complete Customs and Immigration formalities at one of the official ports of entry as soon after arrival as possible.</p>
<p>All offices use a computer terminal now, just fill in the blanks, print, get it stamped and you're done.</p>
<p><i>Note that not all the offices have reliable computers for clearance. St. Pierre in particular is often out of order. </i></p>
<p>The original ship's registration papers must be available as copies are not accepted.</p>
<p>For boats arriving from across the Atlantic, Cul-de-Sac Marin is perhaps a more convenient port to clear in. There is now a large charter base there.</p>
<p><strong>Outward clearance:</strong> It is essential to clear out at one of the official ports so as to obtain the clearance certificate which is requested when clearing in at all other islands. Therefore one must try to clear out during office hours.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months beyond the length of your stay.</p>
<p>As an Overseas department of France, visa requirements are as as for the French mainland. Most visitors do not need visas for stays of up to 3 months. Although regarded as part of the EU, it is <strong>not</strong> a member of the Schengen Agreement Area.</p>
<p>Visas are required for citizens of <span>South Africa, Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Turkey, Dominica, St Lucia, Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.</span></p>
<p>Any non-EU citizen planning a stay over three months will need a visa. In theory EU citizens would also need a visa, but this is not applied to those arriving and leaving on the same yacht.</p>
<p>Non-EU nationals should have a visa if planning to fly in or out of Martinique.</p>

<p>Boats visiting Martinique may stay up to 18 months under temporary admission, provided the purpose of the stay is tourism.</p>
<p>If leaving the boat in bond and flying out of Martinique, for which special permission from Customs must be obtained, this period is suspended until one's return. For more information about leaving a yacht in Martinique contact the Customs office in Fort-de-France.</p>

<div><p>Heathcare in Martinique is good - the best in the Caribbean.</p>
<p><strong>Manchineel trees: beware of danger!</strong><br/><span>Manchineel trees are to be found all along the sandy coast. All parts of this tree are dangerous. The fruit, resembling small apples, the leaves, the bark, the sap, EVERYTHING is toxic. Do not shelter under this tree if it rains and do not use its branches in a barbecue. Contact with any part of this extremely toxic tree can cause severe burns. In Martinique most manchineel trees are recognizable by a red stripe painted on the trunk.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Martinique is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p></div>

<div><p>Cats and dogs over three months old may be admitted temporarily with a bilingual veterinary certificate, which includes proof of anti-rabies inoculation at least 30 days prior to entry and proof of deworming for tapeworm 10 days or less prior to arrival. Dogs and cats must also be identified by a microchip that meets ISO standard 11784, which is the 15 digit transponder operating at 134.2 kHz.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>You may find that officials do not ask to see any documentation for your pet. However cruisers who have visited the French Islands with pets advise the following:</p>
<p>Make sure your dog's vaccinations and rabies documentation are current, get an International Health Certificate from your local vet prior to traveling, have an international microchip and keep invoices for products such as flea/tick/heartworm treatments. It is quite possible the officials in the French Islands will not question you or care about your pet. However, if they do, you can have a local vet provide the documentation required if something is missing from your records.</p>
