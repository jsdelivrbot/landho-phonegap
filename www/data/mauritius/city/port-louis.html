<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/PortLouis.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The flat water sail down the NW coast of Mauritius to Port Louis is a welcome relief after the endless swells of the Indian Ocean.</span></p>
<p>Entrance into Port Louis is straight forward and well marked.There are 2 harbours here; the southern one is the main port and it is where yachts enter. (<i>photo provided by SY Flow Nov. 2013</i>).</p>
<p>Position 020° 08' 49"S, 57° 28'54" E (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the main harbour and the only official port of entry and exit for Mauritius. One must clear in here before visiting any other anchorage.</p>
<p>On arrival at the outer markers, call "Port Louis Port Control" on channel 16. They will probably ask you to switch to channel 14. If you do not request permission to enter the port, <span>you may be intercepted by the coast guard in one of their orange speedboats.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The port is open during daylight hours; arrivals after 18:00 may not be acknowledged by radio. It is acceptable to anchor clear of the entrance until morning.</span></p>
<p>On obtaining permission to enter, proceed to the Customs and Immigration dock (<span>020° 09.6' S, 057° 30.0' E)</span>. This is poorly marked and is located in an old grey building, next to an old windmill (also grey) on the port side right at the end of the main channel. There is only a small dock in front of the building with a sign saying Customs, but it is possible to tie up alongside the concrete quay wall immediately to the south.</p>
<p><span>Take care to avoid the rocky shallow area to the starboard of the direct line to the Customs Station. It is now marked with a small yellow buoy.</span></p>
<p>The skipper will need to visit the <span>Customs House and tell the officer at the Coast Guard/NCG Harbour Security desk that you just arrived and want to clear-in. Ask him to call the Immigration, Customs, and Health departments. Return to the yacht and wait for the officials to visit. </span>Nobodyelse should leave the yacht until the Quarantine Officer has been completed his inspection.</p>
<p>Customs, Immigration and Coast Guard formalities are all completed in the same building or they may visit the boat. Formalities <span>can take over an hour as various officials will need to be called. Be prepared to fill in the 13 forms required by Customs. Be sure to keep the <span>Certificate of Clearance and Yacht Declaration forms safe as they are likely to be checked by the Coast Guard while you are in Mauritius waters.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Occasionally they will board the yacht for inspection.</span></p>
<p>Guns and spearguns must be declared and surrendered to Customs until departure.</p>
<p><span>Be sure to get a copy of your clearance papers because it may be required by coast guard boarding parties if you visit other ports in Mauritius. </span></p>
<p>Once formalities are completed you are free to move over to La Marina inside the Caudan waterfront development.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing out</strong></p>
<p>This is best done early in the morning. Be sure to report accurately where you are moored as the Coast Guard patrol daily and note all foreign vessels in each sector.</p>
<p>Yachts must officially clear out even if leaving for <span>Rodrigues or Saint Brandon as well as for a foreign port.</span></p>
<p><span>First visit <span>Coast Guard Harbour Security and inform them you are leaving. They can notify <span>Immigration and Customs, or you can make the necessary appointments yourself (for before 10am). Once all the paperwork has been done, make a second  <span>visit  to </span><span>Coast Guard Harbour Security for them to update their ledger.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Yachts may proceed to the marina after clearing and tie at any available spot. Tying on the outside wall is permitted however this is rather exposed and uncomfortable from passing wake. The marina quay is concrete, with a nasty overhang, so an abundance of fenders are needed and a fender board. Rafting is permitted.</span></p>
<p>If planning on leaving your boat here for any length of time, it is advisable to take great care with how your fenders are situated to prevent damage from the tidal movement and harsh concrete docks. Fenders are often stolen here, so be sure to secure each fender with a lock (bicycle lock). It may also be preferable to have a boat you know raft alongside for the duration of your absence. Locals can be employed as guardinage (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Mauritius/PortLouis?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices">General Services</a></strong>).</p>
<p><span></span>Port Louis is a a dirty harbour (particularly filthy after heavy rains) and diesel is often present on the surface of the water. Easterly winds usually keep this out of the marina however expect your waterline and lines to suffer.</p>
<p><span></span>If westerly swells are present the quay becomes untenable and yachts should move elsewhere, commonly into the Caudan Basin. This is<span> used as a cyclone shelter and visiting yachts may go into the basin and tie for free wherever there is room. Proceed with caution as there are shallow areas and numerous unmarked wrecks there. </span></p>
<p>It is advisable to lock your boat at all times here.</p>
<p>There is a fuel dock in the commercial port and a dry dock that undertakes some repair work, however marine supplies are extremely limited.<span></span></p>

      This is more like a small tidal basin (with difficult concrete docks) than a marina. There tends to be a lot of rafting due to lack of space. There is water and electricity, showers, laundry, and various restaurants and shops close by. Docking fees are very reasonable. Pay at the Caudan Security office across the parking lot from the quay. They will accept mail and packages. Low tide depth varies between 2-4m. Maximum length 30m. <br>
Dry dock and hull repair facilities, sail repairs, winches, divers.
