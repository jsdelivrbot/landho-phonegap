<div><p><a class="external-link" href="PortLouis"><strong>Port Louis</strong></a> is the only official Port of Entry on <strong>Mauritius</strong>. Detailed information about arrival and clearance procedures in Port Louis can be found on the Port Louis port pages.</p>
<p>It is necessary to clear in here even if you have previously cleared in at Port Mathurin. No agent is required.</p>
<p><strong>Rodrigues</strong> Island is part of Mauritius, yet they have their own unique rules and fees. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="PortMathurin">Port Mathurin</a></strong>, the Port of Entry for Rodrigues, for clearance information.</p>
<p>St Brandon (Cargados Carajos Shoals) and Agalega should not be visited without prior permission in writing from the Ministry of External Affairs &amp; Emigration in Port Louis, except in an emergency.</p>
<p>Although not an official port of entry, yachts have been allowed to stay in Grand Baie and leave from there after clearing out in Port Louis. There does not seem to be a strict rule about this and a yacht wishing to clear out may be required to return to Port Louis.</p>
<p><strong>To clear out of Mauritius</strong>, it is necessary to buy a Customs clearance form from the chamber of commerce in Port Louis. Stamps must then be bought at the post office to be affixed on the form by Customs.</p>
<p>Initial immigration clearance is either 1, 2 or 3 months but visa extensions of up to 180 days are usually granted without any problem.</p>
<p>The maximum stay is for the boat is 6 months in any 12 but stays of more than 90 days require a bond of 10% of the value of the boat.</p>
<p><span>Officials in Mauritius are courteous and professional, will speak English as well as French and Creole, and they will not ask for any fees or other payments.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Be sure to get a copy of your clearance papers because it may be required by coast guard boarding parties if you visit other ports in Mauritius.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><strong> Due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Mauritius, all meat and dairy products on board are being confiscated on arrival at Reunion Island. This may also be applied in other countries.</strong></p>

<div><p><span>Passports must be valid for the length of your stay.</span></p>
<p>Travellers who arrive and depart with the same yacht, do not require a visa.</p>
<p><span>Citizens of most countries will be given a 30, 60 or 90 day visa on arrival.</span></p>
<p>Nationals of several countries including <span>Afghanistan</span><span>, </span><span>Bangladesh</span><span>, </span><span>Indonesia</span><span>, </span><span>Iran</span><span>, </span><span>Iraq</span><span>, N. Korea, Libya, Mali, Pakistan, </span><span>Philippines</span><span>, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Vietnam and Yemen </span><strong>must</strong><span> obtain a visa before travelling to Mauritius, even in transit.</span></p>
<p><span>Nationals of </span><span>Algeria, Nigeria, Myanmar (Burma), Madagascar and Comoros are given a two week visa only.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>See<strong> </strong><a href="http://passport.govmu.org/English/Passport%20and%20Visa%20Requirement%20in%20Mauritius/Pages/Visa-Requirements-in-Mauritius.aspx"><strong>Mauritius Passport Site</strong> </a> for full details.</p>
<p>If a visa is required, it may be obtained abroad from Mauritius High Commissions or embassies and where these do not exist, from British embassies.</p>
<p>Visa extensions can be obtained by applying to the Immigration office at Sterling House, a short distance from the waterfront in downtown Port Louis. Several forms must be completed and documents provided, so it is worth going there a day or two before to get the list of what is needed. Visa extensions of up to 180 days for owners and crew are commonly approved.</p>
<p><span>You can stay a maximum of 6 months, during any 12 month period, in Rodrigues, Saint Brandon, AND Mauritius (combined). If you want to stay longer than 6 months you must request an "exemption" from the Immigration Department. Your exception request must be in writing and submitted near your 50th day of visitation. Your request will be sent to the Prime Minister in Mauritius for consideration. There are 13 legal exemption categories for extending your stay.</span></p>
<p><strong>Leaving your boat in Mauritius:-</strong></p>
<p>The yacht's skipper (not the crew) has to get a letter  from the visa section in the Immigration main office in Port Louis, permitting him  to fly out. To get this letter (which one has to show to passport control at the  airport) you have to employ someone who will be responsible for the boat while  you are away. You have to bring a letter from that skipper as well as a copy of  his skipper's certificate and national I.D. Also needed, are copies of the first page of your passport, the page with the entry stamp, a copy of the health check  document, your agreement with the Caudan marina, (or any other place you plan to  leave the boat) plus the receipt for the payment to it. Lastly, a copy of your  confirmed airline ticket out and back again at specific dates. It is possible that the airport Immigration officers may not enforce this rule but a possible  penalty could be losing your flight.</p>
<p><span>One important point to note is that you need the letter from Immigration when you clear out of the country, but you may well need some documentation when you check in at the airport on your return to prove that you have a yacht (e.g. boat registration and a copy of the letter from the guardianage company). </span></p>
