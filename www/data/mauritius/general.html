<div><p>The international phone code for Mauritius is +230</p>
<p>The whole island is covered by a GSM mobile network.</p>
<p>Mobile phone: Roaming agreements with international mobile phone companies are available and coverage extends over the entire island. Local mobile calls are the same as the price of landline calls, so it’s worth buying a local SIM card for your handset if you plan to make more than a few phone calls on the island.</p>
<p>Internet: There are Internet cafés in both main towns and tourist centres such as Grand Baie and Port Louis. Most hotels offer wireless Internet access. Internet cafes are widely available.</p>
<p><span>Parts and equipment which are not available locally may be ordered and quickly shipped from the US or Europe via FedEx, UPS, or DHL or other carriers. Yachts in transit are not subject to the 15% VAT but customs clearance and delivery fees may add up to more than that amount. Talk to the courier company before your parts arrive to decide whether you wish to pay the vat or the customs clearance fees.</span></p></div>
