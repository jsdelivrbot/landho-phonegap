<div><ul>
<li>Bonaire together with <a class="external-link" href="../Aruba"><strong>Aruba</strong></a> and<strong> <a class="external-link" href="../Curacao">Curacao</a></strong> form the ABC islands. They are the three western-most islands of the Leeward Antilles in the Caribbean. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bonaire is the easternmost of the ABC islands. It is now a special municipality of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aruba is a flat island, exposed to the ocean currents. Bonaire and Curaçao are surrounded by reefs, and so are much more sheltered from the weather. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Both Bonaire and Curaçao's reefs form popular tourist destinations. With its stunning underwater scenery, Bonaire is ranked as one of the top three dive spots in the world, and the whole island is a protected marine park.</li>
<li>Bonaire is less densely populated than its neighbour Curacao and also less developed. The slow pace of life on the island and its relaxed population have an enduring charm.</li>
<li>For visiting sailors the attraction also lies in the better than average repair and service facilities. Marina berths &amp; services are available at Harbour Village Marina (also known as Bonaire Marina), Plaza Resort Marina and Club Nautico. El Navegante yard offers haulout and storage.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>
