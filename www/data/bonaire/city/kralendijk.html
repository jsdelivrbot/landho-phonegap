<div class="hello"><div><p>For detailed information on clearance, customs and immigration etc. see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bonaire?rc=Formalities">Bonaire Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Yachts clearing in should proceed<span> to a mooring or </span><span>the arrivals dock at one of the marinas </span><span>and go for clearance later by dinghy.</span></p>
<p>Clear with Customs and Immigration. They <span>are now together in the same building (<span>yellow building with red roof at the end of North Pier)</span>.  <span>This Pier (on the Navionics map at 12° 08.984"N  68° 16.680"W) is the large  L shaped one for commercial vessels and the dinghy dock for visiting Immigration and Customs is on its SE, side near the land. </span></span></p>
<p>The Customs office is officially open 24 hours a day seven days a week and no overtime is charged, however cruisers have reported that the office tends to have a lunch break between 12h00-14h00 and is closed on a Sunday.</p>
<p><span>It has been reported that there is only a single Immigration officer on duty, and he/she is sometimes at the airport instead of the customs office. They will usually give you a time when the immigration officer will be there.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>Anchoring is strictly forbidden as the whole island is a designated marine park.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong></p>
<p>There are 40 public yacht moorings in front of the town. These moorings are painted red and normally there are a few available. First come - first served.</p>
<p>Contact the Harbour Village Marina for mooring assignments via channel 17 before picking up a mooring. If arriving on a Sunday when offices are closed, find a suitable mooring and contact the marina office Monday morning to finalise. Note that if the wind goes SW these mooring can be quite rough.</p>
<p>Moorings cost USD $10 + 6% tax per day, regardless of the size of boat. Boats over 55ft cannot use the moorings and must proceed to a marina.</p>
<p><strong>Marinas</strong></p>
<p>Marinas include the "Yachthaven" at Harbour Village Marina or at Bonaire Nautico Marina (on pontoons or buoys). The Plaza Resort marina is often full and so a reservation must be made in advance.</p>
<p>Although the North Pier has been extended so that <span>smaller yachts can dock at the inside, </span><span>it is not recommended that they do so as the s</span><span>urge caused by fast dive boats does not make it either comfortable or safe.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dinghy Docks</strong></p>
<p><span>Marina Bonaire has a dinghy dock and makes a small $1 a day service fee for garbage drop off and/or use of their dinghy dock. The other option is to use</span><span> Karel's bar as a dinghy dock and the green containers on the street for garbage disposal. The cruise ship pier can also be used if no cruise ships are in port.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Budget Marine is trying to obtain a permit to install a floating dinghy dock near the Yellow Sub dive shop.</span></span></p>
