<div><p><b>Bonaire National Marine Park regulations:</b></p>
<p>Due to the marine park status of the island, spearfishing is forbidden and marine life of any description may not be removed or destroyed. Spearguns must be left with Customs for the duration of one's stay as it is illegal to have a speargun in one's possession.</p>
<p>The authorities are making great efforts to protect the marine environment. <b>Anchoring is prohibited everywhere. </b>40 mooring buoys have been placed in the area between North Pier and Harbour Village Marina (who manage them for the National Marine Park). The charge is <span> USD $10 + 6% tax per day, regardless of boat length, for boats up to 55 feet. Longer boats will be required to stay in the marina</span></p>
<p>Anchoring, except in an emergency, is an offence. The only exception is for boats under 10 ft (3 m) who may anchor with a stone anchor.</p>
<p>Cruising boats are now expected to have holding tanks and the discharge of any waste is prohibited.</p>
<p>There are mooring buoys on all popular diving sites. The marinas collect fees on behalf of the Bonaire National Marine Park. See <a href="http://www.bmp.org"><strong>www.bmp.org</strong></a> for more information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Radio Use:</strong></em> Cruising boats are expected to use only VHF Channels 71, 77 and 88A, as most other channels have been allocated to local operators. Which channels to use as working channels should be ascertained when clearing in, as the use of unauthorised channels can lead to fines and confiscation of equipment.</p>
