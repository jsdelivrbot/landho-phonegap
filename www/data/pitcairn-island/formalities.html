<div><p>The islanders prefer to be informed by radio of a yacht's arrival. VHF Channel 16 is monitored regularly and as the transmitter is situated high on top of the island it is said to have a range in excess of 50 miles. The island is also connected to the outside world by Inmarsat. The HF radio is no longer attended except when a ship is expected. Best contact is <a href="mailto:mayor@pitcairn.gov.pn"><strong>mayor@pitcairn.gov.pn</strong></a></p>
<p>Yachts should anchor or heave-to off Bounty Bay. Anchoring in the deep bay is not advisable if the wind has any east in it. The alternative is to anchor off the west coast, which offers some shelter in the prevailing wind. The locals will advise where to find a temporarily sheltered anchorage, but no one should leave the boat unattended for any length of time as weather conditions can change very quickly and at least two yachts have been lost at Pitcairn when the wind turned unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Getting from your boat ashore can be difficult in your own dinghy, impossible in a big swell. In the past, the islanders would send out their inflatable rescue craft for free, to advise where to anchor and also to take the crew ashore. However, now this launch service has a fixed fee. For use of the large rescue craft, the fee is US$80 (NZ$100). For the dinghy (sufficient to get back and forth to the boat with some provisions, or a mechanic) the fee is US$50. The fees apply each time you use the launch service, however you can normally make several trips to and fro in the time allotted (depending on where you are anchored). You can pay the launch fee either to the Magistrate or to the driver. The service can also be shared with other yachts in the anchorage.</p>
<p>Once ashore, one should pay a call to the Island Magistrate to obtain permission to land and to have one's passport stamped and signed with the impressive Pitcairn stamp.  Yachts may stay as long as this permission is in force. Anyone arriving by boat must leave the island by the same means.</p>

<div><p>People wishing to travel to the Pitcairn Islands must obtain a visitors visa from the Pitcairn Islands Office.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.government.pn/APPLICATION%20FORM%20FOR%20PITCAIRN%20ISLAND%20ENTRY%20CLEARANCE.pdf"><b>Application form for Entry Clearance</b></a>.</p>
<p>Currently the landing fee starts at US$50.00 per person.</p>
<p>Brief visits from passing yachts are permitted and The Island Magistrate is empowered to issue written permits to members of the crew.</p>
<p>Visitors wishing to travel to Pitcairn with children under 16 years <strong>must</strong> contact the Pitcairn Island Office before making any plans to travel. An entry clearance application will need to be completed for any child wishing to visit the island.</p>
<p>Longer stays require permission from the Pitcairn Island Council (email <a href="mailto:mayor@pitcairn.gov.pn" target="_blank">mayor@pitcairn.gov.pn</a>). Allow plenty of time as it will take about three months for the application to be considered.</p>
<p>These regulations apply to all except residents of the Pitcairn Islands Group.</p>
<p>As a precaution against the spread of outside infections, Pitcairn has introduced a requirement for vessels travelling to the island to provide a formal declaration of the health of passengers and crew. The Pitcairn Island doctor will communicate with either the Captain or the ship’s doctor, as appropriate. If there is doubt about fitness of an individual to land on Pitcairn, a brief medical examination may be required including measurement of body temperature.</p>

<p>Fruit, vegetable and plants may only be landed with the prior permission of the Island Council, to avoid possible infestation of indigenous crops.</p>
<p>It is important that honey, and other bee products are <strong>not</strong> brought to Pitcairn. The Pitcairners have begun to expand their beekeeping efforts, and the island hives have recently been declared 100% free of disease. In order to keep the hives pristine, it is very important that the island not be accidentally exposed to products of bees from other areas that could contaminate the Pitcairn bee population.</p>
