<div class="hello"><div><p>Bounty Bay is being remodelled (Spring/Summer 2009), armouring to strengthen the jetty, as well as widening and deepening. Extensive wind and wave data have shown that a breakwater would not increase landing capacity or safety significantly enough to make it economically viable. The governement are looking at the possibility of an alternate landing facility at the other side of the Island, however this will be a long way off.</p>
<p>All projects on Pitcairn are covered by an environmental impact assessment
and the government want to ensure that nothing is changed that make Pitcairn
special or attractive as a tourist destination. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Pitcairn is rugged, and its coast lined by cliffs for nearly the whole of the island. Nowhere giving easy access to the sea.  Although the canoes can be launched in many places, Bounty Bay and the Tedside landing are the only two places on the island that offer a reasonably safe landing. It is only possible to land at Tedside when winds are easterly and no swell from southwest.</p>
<p><span>Anchoring in Bounty Bay should be just to seaward of a line between the tree on Adams Rock and Isaacs Rocks. This will put you on sand in about 11 to 14m, about 350m from the landing.</span></p>
<p>Burned on 23 January 1790, the remains of Bounty lie 3m below the surface of Bounty Bay.  Although tourists are allowed to dive on the wreck, sadly, over the years, Bounty relics have disappeared from the site and today there is very little left.</p>
