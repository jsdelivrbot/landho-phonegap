                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>The Q flag should be flown at the first port of entry into the Azores. Yachts must clear in at the marina office at one of the ports of entry. After which they will direct you to Customs (Alfandega), Immigration and Guarda Nacional Republicana.</p>
<p>In larger ports, the Policia Maritima should also be visited, as well as the Port Authority (Capitania).</p>
<p>A transit log may be issued by the Port Authority to those yachts from countries not belonging to the European Union, although it appears its use is being phased out.</p>
<p>Several of the marina offices at Ports of Entry are computerised and details of the yachts' arrival are automatically reported to all the appropriate officials.</p>
<p>In all ports of call in the Azores visited subsequently, the transit log (if issued) must be taken along and presented to the local Guarda Nacional Republicana office.</p>
<p>As part of Portugal, the Azores are members of the EU, with which they have a special relationship. The usual EU regulations apply, although because of their isolated position, the authorities tend to treat all arriving yachts as if coming from a non-EU country and subsequently subject them to the full range of clearance formalities.</p>
<p>All boats must display the Portuguese courtesy flag as well as the Azores islands flag (below the Portuguese one and, of course, on the same mast). An Azores flag may be purchased in advance from <strong><a href="Countries/Azores/Horta/?rc=MarineServices#Chandleries">Mid Atlantic Yacht Services</a> </strong>in Horta.</p>
<p>On departure, fees must be paid and then all the officials visited again.</p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared, and it may also be advisable to declare prescription medications as the Customs authorities can enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary importation of such items.</p>
<p>The Azores are part of the EU VAT area, so non-EU yachts may stay for eighteen months before becoming liable for duty. Because the VAT rate here is lower than in mainland Portugal (as well as in other EU countries), it is a useful place to officially import a boat.</p>

<div><p>Yachts must carry their original registration document, insurance policy and ship's radio licence. One member of the crew must have a radio operator’s certificate of competence. For EU boats, proof of VAT status is also required. 
It is also very useful to have a typed sheet containing the name of the boat, port of registry, and the crew list.</p>
<p>A transit log (Livrete de Transito) is issued to non-EU yachts by the Capitania or Delegaoes Maritimas on arrival. All subsequent movements of the yacht are recorded in this log until departure. Yachts must clear in and out of all ports, including harbours on the same island. If arriving from Madeira, the same transit log may be used, but if arriving from mainland Portugal, a new log is usually issued.</p>
