<div class="hello"><div><p>Horta is located on the SE coast of Faial, which is the smallest of the three "Triangle Islands".  The island has one of the main airports in the Azores and Horta itself owes its importance to its sheltered harbour.  The town has several beautiful old buildings.<br/> Almost every concrete wall and surface here is covered with paintings done by boats that have stopped here. It is tradition to leave a painting behind (and your paint if you have any left) to commemorate your voyage.</p>
<p>The volcanic eruption of the 1950's is well documented in the cruising guides, but the Island also suffered a major earthquake in 1998, measuring more than 6 on the Richter scale, severely damaging many buildings.</p>
<p>Position 38°31'09"N, 28°37'50"W (marina)</p>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival yachts should berth alongside the reception quay (minimum 3m). As you pass through the breakwater entrance turn to port and follow the  breakwater on your starboard side to the end. To starboard is a two story white building (fuel pumps can easily be seen at its Northern end). This is the "reception dock."</p>
<p>The marina office is open 0800-1200, 1300-2000 (seven days a week in the high season April to June).</p>
<p>The offices of Immigration, maritime police, Customs (Alfandega) and Guarda Nacional Republicana are next to the marina office in the same building. The marina staff will inform the captain of the order in which these officials must be visited, both on arrival and at departure. Normally it will be Harbour Master first, then Immigration and finally Customs, who may or may not be there, depending if a cruise ship has just arrived.</p>
<p>The marina office will assign a berth once clearance is completed. Yachts arriving after office hours should wait at the reception quay until the next morning.</p>
<p>On departure, first pay the marina fees, then take the receipt to the Guarda Nacional Republicana and the Capitania for outward clearance.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is forbidden for boats, local or visiting, to anchor at Porto Pim (south of Horta) due to the optical fibre submarine cable laid there.</p>
<p>Although the marina at Horta officially has "300 berths", this includes raft-ups, and along the jetty wall yachts raft up to 3 deep in busy season.</p>
<p>Currently, the marina website is not operational. It may also be difficult to get a response via e-mail. Telephoning is the best method of communication.</p>
