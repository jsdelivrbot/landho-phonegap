<div class="hello"><div><p>In this harbour you may be directed to moor alongside the stone quay on entry to the inner harbour, (water only available), or on finger pontoons laid on the inside of the breakwater (water and electricity available). If very busy, anchoring is the only other option.</p>
<p>If unsure, it is better to anchor off and seek local advice as there are limited berths suitable for yachts. These are often used by bigger fishing boats who, understandably, are angry if they arrive back in the middle of the night to find you in their berth.</p>
<p>The inner end of the harbour wall has good depths (up to 3m) but be aware of the propwash from fast ferries and supply ships arriving and leaving.</p>
<p>It is recommended to keep an eye on the weather forecast as would not be protected in strong easterly winds.</p>
<p>To date, berthing here is reported to be free.</p>
