<div class="hello"><div><p>Sao Jorge is part of the "Triangle Islands", being just 22 miles away from Horta and 17 miles away from Lajes de Pico (an interesting circuit if you don't have much time and want to see 3 completely different landscapes and traditions).</p>
<p>Sao Jorge is a great island for adventure, with its steep slopes and remarkable ravines ending in fertile "fajas". These are so numerous and so different that you can find unusual coffee plantations or lagoons amongst them. The island is a surfer's as well as a trekker's paradise. Its cheese production and traditional quilts are also famous.</p>

<p>Visiting yachts used to anchor as there was only limited space alongside, however the marina now makes docking easier although there are limited berths for visitors. During the summer months this is a relatively busy port. Beware of the ferry services.</p>
<p>There is a jetty for bigger, commercial vessels, which protects the small quay and marina from some swells, improving the conditions for visiting yachts.</p>
<p>See cruisers comments below about the swell here and WiFi service.</p>
