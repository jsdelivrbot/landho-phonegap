<div class="hello"><div><p>Flores is the western most island of the Azores, so named for its flowers. Miles and miles of hydrangeas, cannas and wild roses line the roads and the steep volcanic peaks are terraced by fields bordered by stone walls lined with yet more hydrangeas. The lakes of the interior are worth a visit, some with waterfalls. The locals here are reported to be very friendly and helpful.</p>
<p><span>Lajes is located on the south east coast of the island and is the administrative centre. </span><span>There is very small marina here, however, this is NOT a good refuge in any conditions involving strong E-NE winds as the little marina becomes very turbulent and it is difficult to manoeuver inside. It is recommended to speak with officials on arrival to find out weather conditions for the duration of your stay in order to determine how long you should spend here.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Position 39° 22'47"N, 31°10'09"W (Marina)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not an "official" port of entry, however few yachts visit Santa Cruz (the official POE) as it offers poor shelter, therefore the Maritime Police and National Guard check visiting yachts in as an accommodation.</p>
<p>Port officials visit the harbour when they can, to check on visiting yachts. Clearance is done with Police, Immigration and Customs. Officials are reported to be very nice and helpful.</p>
<p>The Maritime Police can be found next to the library, they may check passports and stamp a copy of the crew list, which then needs to be taken to Immigration (across the street and down a block). This office does not appear to be open very often and they won't stamp your passports. Clearance into Europe will have to be done at the next port of call.</p>
<p>All payment must be in cash - there is an ATM behind the church.</p>
<p>All boats should check in with the harbourmaster; during week days he can always be found either at the marina or in the office from 8:00 to 17:00. The harbourmaster is off duty at weekends, so just present yourself at the office on the next Monday. If a vessel  arrives during a weekend and plans to leave on that same weekend, contact the harbormaster over the phone at (+351) 910001889.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If winds are from the E-NE, strong and wave height is more than 2m, avoid the marina altogether. For those seeking shelter in such conditions, go to the anchorage in Fajã Grande, on the other side of the island, which offers good protection in this type of weather. The anchorage there is mostly sand and there is free Wi-Fi, shops, restaurants, and good access to hiking paths.</p>
<p>The entrance to Lages Marina is easy enough in calm daylight conditions, but a different story at night with a heavy swell running.</p>
<p>There is a Red flashing light at the end of the Marina Breakwater. Calling ahead on the VHF is not necessary here.</p>
<p>Limited space can be found alongside at the quay, however quayside mooring is only permitted when a ship is not expected.</p>
<p>The anchorage inside the jetty is sheltered and quite comfortable, however the outer anchorage is very exposed and uncomfortable in strong N/NE winds. <span>The anchorage inside the harbour is chargable, so if you like to anchor for free go to Fajã Grande instead.</span></p>
<p><span></span>The marina permits yachts at anchor to enter the marina for a short stop to fill up with water or pick up provisions. There is a floating pontoon for dinghies.</p>
<p>The municipal building (single story) on the quayside just up from the steps, houses cold water showers and toilets. Facilities are basic. These are the same showers and toilets used by marina guests.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/MarinaLajesdasFlores2011_Aerialphoto.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/><span>Space inside the marina is very limited, so boats bigger than 15m, or catamarans, are likely to not have space inside the marina. The advise is that these boats should go to the anchorage and speak to the Harbour Master about available space.</span></p>
