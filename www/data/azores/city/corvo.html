<div class="hello"><div><p>Corvo does not have a marina, just an anchorage which is deep and rocky. Visiting boats should not be left unattended because of the poor anchorage conditions and weather instability.</p>
<p>On many days of the year here, no boats whatsoever (including local fishing boats and ferries) can neither leave nor enter due to the difficult conditions.</p>
<p>There are for facilities for yachts here.</p>
