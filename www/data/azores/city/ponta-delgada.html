<div class="hello"><div><p class="Body">The concrete reception dock is located just behind the green and white banded tower close to a row of flagpoles and below the conical white roof of the main marina offices. Ar<span>riving yachts must stop there to be cleared in and be assigned a berth.</span></p>
<p>Yachts are normally met on the dock by an officer, who ensures that there is no contact with other boats before formalities are completed. This is normally done during office hours. The office is open Mon-Fri 0900-1830 and Sat-Sun 0900-1730. It closes at lunch for 1½ hours. Yachts arriving outside of these times must not enter the marina, but come alongside the reception dock and await clearance.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a <span>busy harbour and is sheltered by a massive 1500m outer breakwater.  The breakwater however continues a further 50-100m out with large rocks awash and underwater and should be given a wide berth.</span></p>
<p>This large marina provides excellent facilities for yachts visiting the Azorean capital. The range of repair facilities is also expanding and boats can be hauled out here. Water and electricity is available on all pontoons and fuel is available at the fuelling berth.</p>
<p>Cruisers have reported that swell can be a major problem in winds from east to south-west.</p>
