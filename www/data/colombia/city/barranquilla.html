<p>For a list of agents see <strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>Remember, an agent is required to clear into and out of Colombia, so no attempt at contacting the Port Captain should be made, except through your nominated clearing agent (Agencia Maritima) on arrival.</span></p>
<p>The yacht clubs have limited space, and anchoring is dangerous in the busy river. It may be necessary to come alongside the commercial dock.</p>
