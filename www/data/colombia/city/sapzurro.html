<div class="hello"><div><p>Sapzurro is located on Colobia's Caribbean coast, in the Darien Gap on the border with Panama, and sadly is missed by many who head straight for Cartagena. You can however clear here (or just around the corner at Capurgana) and it is a picture-perfect little Colombian fishing village of around 500 people, with a small sheltered bay and coral reef just 10 metres from the beach. The thick Darien jungle in the surrounding hills comes right down to the sandy beaches.</p>
<p>Position 08° 39'N, 77° 21'W</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For a list of agents see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, an agent is required to clear into and out of Colombia, so no attempt at contacting the Port Captain should be made, except through your nominated clearing agent (Agencia Maritima) on arrival.</p>
<p>Anchor on the Eastern side of the harbour and catch a launch to Capurgana (an open bay around the corner) for clearing in.</p>
<p>All crew members aboard need to go.  Many of the boats that move backpackers from Panama to Colombia bring them here and pick them up as you can also clear out of the country by land here too.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As for entering the harbor at Sapzurro - stand off about a mile and enter through the reefs keeping the view of the town in the middle of the entrance. There are markers, red right returning, for entering the harbour. The reefs are marked as well. Go straight towards the cruise ship mooring buoy and then turn East to find a spot out of the swell.</p>
<p>It is possible to get diesel here.</p>
