<div class="hello"><div><p>Although this is a Port of Entry, it is not the best place for yachts, except in an emergency.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Great care needs to be taken in this bay due to the number of logs and other debris washed into it from the surrounding rivers.</p>
<p>The port should not be approached at night as the large number of un-marked fishing nets are impossible to see in the dark.</p>
<p>There are several marinas here, mainly for sports boats.</p>
