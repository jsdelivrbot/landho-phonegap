<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>For a list of agents see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, an agent is required to clear into and out of Colombia, so no attempt at contacting the Port Captain should be made, except through your nominated clearing agent (Agencia Maritima) on arrival.</p>
<p>One should anchor off the pier and wait to be boarded. If the officers do not come out, the captain should go to Customs at the far end of the dock. If there is space on the pier it may be possible to go alongside but it is not the best place for a yacht.</p>
