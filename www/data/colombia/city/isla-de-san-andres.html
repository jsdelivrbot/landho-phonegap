<p>Clearance formalities must be completed even if coming from mainland Colombia. Visas are issued on arrival for 30 to 90 days depending on nationality.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is quite good protection in the anchorage here, however if winds reach 20+ knots from the East or SE it will get a bit bumpy.The anchorage is <span>north of a small island of Cotton Cay.  Most of this anchorage is filled up with fishing boats on moorings, but there is space to anchor to at the east end of the anchorage, just off Nene's Marina.</span> The anchorage can get very busy in the afternoons with jet skis and taxi boats - Providencia is quieter.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage is  north-east of Cotton Cay, just off the San Andres Yacht Club (12°34.67N  81°41.55W). To reach it you <strong>must</strong> go round to the south of Cotton Cay.</p>
<p><span>There are not many places to leave your dinghy because most of the shore line appears to be private and is fenced off.  You can leave your dinghy at Nene's Marina or the Yacht Club for weekly fee per person (non-negotiable).</span></p>
<p>Provisioning is limited here. Fuel is available from Nene's Marina or do a jerry jug run from the fuel dock.</p>
