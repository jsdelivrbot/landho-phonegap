<div class="hello"><div><p>There are many buoys marked on various charts.  None of them exist.</p>
<p><strong><i>Isla Grande</i> </strong></p>
<p>On the East of the island is a long sandy beach with entry behind the reef from the East only.  Approach from East of Isla Pelano.</p>
<p>In the bay to the west, a crooked concrete post at 10 11.052N and 075 44.5W marks the gap between two reefs which run parallel to the shore.  Leave this to starboard and head WSW to 10 11.11N and 075  44.6W  This is between another crooked post and one that is nearly straight.  Once through the gap you are clear to nose in and find an anchor spot – watch as it gets shallow very quickly to the W.</p>
<p>Both of these anchorages are destinations for day tripper boats so the loud music stops at about 1700.</p>
<p>The northern entrance to Cano Raton is marked by red and green posts.  If you have somebody on the bow looking for colour changes then you could easily gunk hole in lots of places here.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><span>There was a violent attack on a cruising boat here in </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/Countries/Colombia/colombia-islas-del-rossario-isla-grande-boarded-attacked-july-2016/"><strong>July 2016 in Islas del Rossario</strong></a> following an attempted dinghy theft. <span>The two crew managed to repel the attackers but were badly shaken and very lucky to escape.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the 2nd violent attack in Islas del Rossario. <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/colombia-islas-del-rossario-yacht-boarded-and-crew-member-killed">A similar incident which sadly resulted in the murder of one crew member happened in September 2015.</a></b></span></p>
<p><span>A report was received from a cruiser in December 2014 who was anchored here and whose outboard was stolen from a lifted dinghy at night. It was not locked. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Dinghy and outboard thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy and outboard on deck and chain them overnight. </span></p>
