<p>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The bay is well protected but is open to the north.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage not far past the small military outpost and near the little bar where the ferry pier is located. Anchor in about 60’ in uneven mud, but beware of rapid shoalling towards the shore.</p>
<p>The best dinghy landing is at the pier on the west side of the bay where there is a bar with an outdoor shower and some provisions..</p>
