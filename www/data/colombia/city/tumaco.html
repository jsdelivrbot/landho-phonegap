<div class="hello"><div><p>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Tumaco is a military controlled port. You must call <code>Guardacosta</code> on VHF channel 16 when you reach the sea buoy (01° 51.80’N, 078°46.15’W).</p>
<p><strong>Do not proceed</strong> past this point until you have spoken with them and given them all your information and they have cleared you to enter. They will require a great number of details so have all boat paperwork and crew details to hand. It is possible to request an English translator, if necessary.</p>
<p>The Port Captain's office is at the Naval base and is very helpful. <span>Ask the Port Captain to contact your agent.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage is in an estuary off the SE side of Isla del Morro, which is connected to the town by a bridge. Security is good as there is a military base on the other side of the channel. It provides complete shelter from all winds.</p>
<p>You will be advised where to anchor.</p>
<p>There is a commercial dock, which is not suitable for yachts.</p>
<p>It may be possible to use the military pier for landing with the dinghy but ensure you have permission first. Call the guards on VHF channel 71.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the owner of the wharf is very friendly and will allow access across his property.</p>
<p>Use an anchor light at night and it is best to return to the boat by early evening. Also to ensure the boat is locked when away from it.</p>
