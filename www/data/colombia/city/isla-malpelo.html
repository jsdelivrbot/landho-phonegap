<div class="hello"><div><p>The Columbian military requests that vessels passing within 20 miles of Isla Malpelo report their presence to the military via VHF Ch:16. If they cannot get a visual on slow moving boats, or a response on the VHF, it's likely they will send either a helicopter or a boat to investigate.</p>
<p>Isla Malpelo is located approximately 235 miles/378 km from the Columbian coast and 225 miles/362 km from Panama.</p>
<p>Malpelo is a UNESCO World Heritage site for marine parks. If you dive, Malpelo is a world class dive spot on par with Cocos with clear water and tons of fish and sharks. Divers often see 100's of sharks schooling, some of the biggest (non-baited) schools ever filmed have been at Malpelo. <span>Its reputed to be one of the top dive sites in the world with a very large population of silky and hammerhead sharks.</span></p>
<p>Malpelo has been a protected area since 1990 and part of the military's charter is to prevent illegal fishing and shark finning. In 2011 there was a massive <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/19/shark-massacre-colombia"><strong>shark massacre</strong></a> where estimates are over 2,000 sharks were finned to be sold in Asia. After this incident the military are keeping a close eye on all vessels in the area of the park.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span> There is no anchorage here as it is very deep close to the island.</span></p>
<p>The Navy however continues to extend their offer to visiting cruising boats, letting them use their buoys if their supply ship is not there. Navy personnel are reported to be very friendly (they don't get many visitors) and the odds are you will be invited to play a game of soccer with them.</p>
