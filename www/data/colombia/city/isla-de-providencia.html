<div class="hello"><div><p>This Colombian island lies midway between Costa Rica and Jamaica. It is connected to the smaller Santa Catalina Island by a 100 metre footbridge. With a long history of pirates and hidden treasure, it's no surprise this is Colombia's major scuba destination.</p>
<p>A scenic and friendly island, Providencia is convenient for a break on passage to/from Panama. Although a district of Columbia, it lies about 135NM east of the coast of Nicaragua and about 500nm from mainland Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a significant datum offset (more than 200 metres) for both Navionics and C-Map electronic charting. This applies to Low Cay, north of Providencia and to Providencia Island itself. It may also apply to San Andres Island and to the Albuquerque Cays.</p>
<p><span>There are several channels leading into the port of Catalina. The primary channel is marked with six buoys and starts with the deep water buoy. Entering the harbour is straight forward.</span></p>
<p><span>The tourist office is very helpful and they have copies of a "Cruising Guide to Colombia", which is well worth asking  for because it contains reduced colour copies of the major charts for all of the  Colombian coastline.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 13° 22'48"N, 81° 22'19"W (Catalina)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><div>
<p>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="../Buenaventura/Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For a list of agents see <strong><a class="external-link" href="../Buenaventura/Countries/Colombia/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, an agent is required to clear into and out of Colombia, so no attempt at contacting the Port Captain should be made, except through your nominated clearing agent (Agencia Maritima) on arrival.</p>
<p>Clearance formalities must be completed even if coming from mainland Colombia. Visas are not required, nor issued.</p>
<p>It is likely Mr Bush (contact Bernardo, VHF ch.16) will be your appointed agent. He will arrange clearance formalities, however it could well take a few days for everything to be completed with several trips ashore required to visit his office with paperwork. His fee is $80 plus $30 a passport for a tourist card (2013).</p>
<p>If you're lucky he will respond to your VHF call and arrange to meet you at the dinghy dock.  Otherwise, dinghy ashore, turn right at the dinghy dock and left at the only  road junction in town, walk 400 metres up the road past the supermarkets and  you'll see a general store on the right with a sign for Bush Agencies on the  first floor.  Mr Bush owns the store and his office is in his apartment above  the store. It's all very relaxed and everyone knows Mr Bush.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Low Cay</strong> - at the north end of the reef to the north of Providencia, makes a good night time anchorage if you arrive after dark from the north and don't want to attempt the approach to Providencia.</p>
<p><strong>Providencia Island (Catalina)</strong> - has a buoyed approach. The main channel into the anchorage is well buoyed and well lit and so possible to enter safely at night.</p>
<p>Be careful not to anchor in the channel as it is used day and night by freighters. Watch out for the reef in the middle of the bay about 350 metres south of Santa Catalina island. (Remember the big chart offset.) A<span>nchor south of Santa Catalina island. The anchorage is sand and turtle grass with most yachts anchoring in 6 to 12 feet of water. </span>This is a quiet and protected anchorage as long as there is not a big swell from the North.</p>
<p>There is a good dinghy dock l<span>ocated just north of the concrete commercial wharf. Make sure you have a stern anchor with you so that your dinghy doesn't get swept under the dock.</span></p>
