<div class="hello"><div><p>This island, lying about 18nm off the Pacific coast of Colombia, is another National Park. For many years it was a maximum security prison, but now is a location for scientific research and tourism. It has a wide range of marine species as well as coral reefs. A main attraction is the humpbacked whales which come to mate there between June and October.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Approach should be made from the east. There are extensive shoals off the southern end of the island. There are good lights marking the island.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to anchor, the Authorities prefer yachts to use one of their buoys.</p>
<p>There is a hotel and restaurant and several interesting walking trails.</p>
