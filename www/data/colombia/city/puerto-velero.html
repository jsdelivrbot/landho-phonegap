<p>This marina built in 2013 <span>is located between Barranquilla and Cartagena. Puerto Velero is a </span><span>popular beach resort and the marina </span><span>is built on a reef and </span><span>huge sand bar that extends from the mainland.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Reports from cruisers are good and state that it is </span><span>more affordable here than Cartagena or Santa Marta</span><span>. The area is clean and developing and a large anchorage is also available should you not wish to dock in the marina.</span></p>
<p>Whilst services and amenities ashore for shopping are limited, the marina is just 25 minutes by road from <strong><a class="external-link" href="../Barranquilla">Barranquilla</a> </strong>where provisions can easily be restocked. It does of course mean you will have to take a taxi to re-provision. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the area.</p>
<p>Position <span>10° 56' 40"N, 75<span>°</span> 02' 22"W.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Full details on the formalities required for clearing into and out of Colombia can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Colombia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For a list of agents see <strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Remember, an agent is required to clear into and out of Colombia, so no attempt at contacting the Port Captain should be made, except through your nominated clearing agent (Agencia Maritima) on arrival.</p>
<p>The marina acts as a Maritime agency so can help with paper work and clearance procedures.</p>
<p><span>A trip by taxi into Barranquilla to check-in with Immigration is required. This costs $80US.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="../../colombia-pics/colombia_puerto-velero-june-15/@@images/image/preview"/>There is a green buoy at the entrance to the marina</span><span> (</span><i>photo courtesy of Puerto Velero Marina</i><span>)</span><span>. </span><span>Call on VHF channel 08 prior to arrival.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>There is power and water on the pontoons, some fingers (most of which are Med style mooring) and the marina can get fuel. The </span><span>showers and washroom are clean, and laundry is possible via the marina office (not self-service).</span></p>
<p><span>An adjacent</span><span> boatyard is still under construction, with haul out facilities to be completed. Some repair and maintenance services are now available.</span></p>
<p><span>The very</span><span> large bay here provides a sheltered anchorage with a sandy bottom, 3-10m deep. The water here is reported to be very clean so y<span>ou can swim off the boat and on many days see the bottom. </span></span></p>
