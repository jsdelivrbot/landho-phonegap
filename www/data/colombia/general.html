<div><p>Peso (Col$) of 100 centavos. A maximum of 500 pesos can be exported and not more than 60 Col$ exchanged on departure.</p>
<p><span>The Peso varies its exchange rate with the US dollar. For example, in late 2009 it was 2350 peso's to the dollar. In 2012 1820 peso's to the dollar. So, if you agree on having work done on your boat here, it's advisable to somehow lock in the final price. </span></p>
<p>Travellers' cheques are difficult to change, as reportedly there are many forged American Express travellers' cheques in circulation. It is also difficult to change pounds sterling and US dollars are preferred, particularly smaller notes such as US$20 bills. <span>The exchange rate on actual dollars however is quite poor, so you need to either arrange for a bank transfer or get your money out of the ATM's. </span></p>
<p>Use great care when banking here, especially outside of the centro area. Perhaps use a taxi for return trips to your boat if handling large amounts of cash, or use ATM’s and work with smaller sums of money. In a bank others may see you counting out large sums or you may be marked as a good target.</p>
<p>It is perhaps a good idea to have more than one credit card in case of emergencys and to have copies of your passport.</p></div>
