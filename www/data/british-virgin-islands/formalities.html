                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><span><span><strong><span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/">SailClear</a>,</span></strong></span></span><span><span> the </span></span><span>advance web notification service for clearance, is supposed to now be operational here.</span></p>
<p><i><strong>2015: </strong>Cruisers report that authorities in Spanish Town, Virgin Gorda, and <span>Soper’s Hole (West End) Tortola, still do not use</span> SailClear.</i></p>
<p>On approaching BVI during daylight, proceed directly to a Port of Entry and clear immigration controls.  Yachts arriving outside of business hours must fly the <code>Q</code> flag and register with Immigration on the next business day. It is advisable to contact Immigration in advance if you are likely to arrive at night. No persons may go ashore until the yacht has been cleared nor may it enter a marina unless an agent has been employed.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment.</p>
<p>Normal business hours are 08:30 to 16:30 (Monday-Friday) and 08:30 to 12:30 <span> (Saturday), but they do vary at different ports. See the individual port pages for more details.</span></p>
<p>Clearance outside normal working hours incurs additional charges. Call <span>Customs at 284-494-3475 and Immigration at 284-494-3701 ext. 4700 to make after-hours arrangements. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Because space </span>at jetties at the Ports of Entry (see bottom of page) is limited, vessels are allowed to anchor in the harbour before Clearing in.</span></p>
<p>Ship's papers, passports and last clearance must be shown, and an inward manifest and/or outward manifest, and crew list completed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the British Virgin Islands and the US Virgin Islands require full Customs clearance out and in when sailing between them. If, however, your stay is short, you may be able to clear in and out at the same time.</p>
<p>Private boats are automatically given up to 30 days to cruise around the BVI. Recently (Feb 2015) some officials in some ports have been charging private yachts a fee of $1/foot/day. Cruisers have suggested that having paperwork showing that you have not previously been charged this fee will allow you to avoid it. However, according to the BVI Ports Authority's own statement, it currently should not be charged at all. See 'Fees' section below.</p>
<p>A cruising permit is required for all charter yachts cruising in the BVI.</p>
<p>If wishing to use a day mooring in a National Park, then a permit must be purchased when clearing in.</p>
<p>A recreational fishing permit must also be obtained if planning to fish. See Fisheries Department Tel: +284 494 5681</p>

<p><strong>National parks</strong>: A reef protection programme is in operation in an effort to limit damage caused by visiting boats.

<p>(1)The reef protection buoys are colour coded: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Red buoys:</span> non-diving, day use only; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yellow buoys:</span> commercial dive vessels only (or boats over 55ft); <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White buoys:</span> non-commercial vessels for dive use only, on a first come first served basis and a 90 minute time limit; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blue buoys:</span> dinghy use only.</p>
<p>(2) Vessels over 55 ft LOA or 35 tons may now use the larger yellow mooring buoys.</p>

<div><p><strong>Dogs and Cats</strong><br/> Dogs and Cats are only permitted entry after the Ministry of Agrigulture's Veterinary Division issues an Import Permit. The BVI is a rabies free territory and in order to protect against the spread of this disease there are strict regulations for pets coming in from countries that are known to have outbreaks of rabies, such as United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Caribbean nations of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the US Virgin Islands are rabies free.</p>
<p>Full details on requesting an Import Pertmit can be obtained from the Department of Agriculture, Veterinary Division, on Tel: (284)495 3701 ext. 6123 or apply on line at  <a href="http://www.britishvirginislands.com/ntk_permitspet.htm">www.britishvirginislands.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>All Animals</strong><br/> For all animals, a valid Health Certificate issued at least two weeks prior to arrival must be shown (plus a valid anti-rabies certificate for dogs and cats as above).</p>
<p>No animals can be landed without a permit and must remain secured on board at all times. A permit will contain full details (species, sex, age, colour, country of origin, owner's name and address, means of arrival).</p>
<p>A charge of US$5 per animal is made by Customs at the time of clearance and all certificates must be presented at the same time. The penalty for breaking the law is a fine and impounding of the animal. All animals entering the territory must be declared at Customs.</p>
<p>All pets must have current health certificates and vaccinations, especially with respect to rabies.</p>
