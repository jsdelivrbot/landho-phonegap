<div class="hello"><div><p>Road Town is home to the beautiful J.R. O'Neal Botanic Gardens which wind through close to three acres of indigenous and exotic plants, trees and herbs. The capital is also brimming with restaurants, shops, and is the site for the hospital, government administration offices and official Governor's House with its historical museum. Just behind Waterfront Drive is Main Street, a peep into the B.V.I'.s architectural past, which still has many historic buildings and churches, charming cafes, and curio shops as well as the Virgin Islands Folk Museum.</p>

      Strictly speaking this docking facility belongs to a charter
company, however often they have berths available and so can accept cruisers. Doyles Sails on site and Royal BVI
Yacht Club which welcomes guests is adjacent. Reported (April 2012) to be excellent at recommending people for repairs. A number of eateries are close by. On the main bus route into town.
