<div class="hello"><div><p>Anegada is the northernmost of the British Virgin Islands. It lies approximately 15 miles north of Virgin Gorda.</p>
<p>It is a flat island, formed from coral and limestone, its highest point being only 28 feet above sea level. It is best known for its miles of white sand beaches, but it also has large salt ponds which cover much of the west end of the island.</p>
<p>A totally unspoiled island and well worth a visit, even if it is just for their famous lobster dinner.</p>
<p>Position 18° 43'21"N, 064° 23'08"W (moorings)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Anchorage lies between Setting Point and Pomato Point and the entrance through the reef is now well marked and lit. It is however difficult to see the buoys in rough conditions and concentration and care is needed in order to enter safely.</p>
<p>There are overnight mooring buoys available here. Contact the Anegada Reef Hotel or Neptune's Treasure for availability. Alternatively yachts can anchor in hard sand with good holding.</p>
<p>There are several dinghy docks at the various hotels and restaurants.</p>
<p>The Settlement is the main inhabited area on the island and is primarily a fishing village with little in the way of supplies. There is a small Post Office, Dotsy's Bakery, launderette, Government Administration Building, and a medical clinic here.</p>
<p>A walk to the isolated beach at the west end comes recommended, as does a trip to Loblolly Bay, by bike or taxi.</p>
