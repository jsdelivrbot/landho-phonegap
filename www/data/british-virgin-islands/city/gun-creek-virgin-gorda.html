<div class="hello"><div><p>Gun Creek is located in the south west corner of Bakers Bay, Gorda Sound. It is about 2nm west of the Bitter End Yacht Club.</p>
<p>It provides a very useful stop for yachts coming across from St Maarten, as it gives immediate access to the sheltered and large bays of Gorda Sound. It also avoids having to go to crowded Spanish Town further south to check in.</p>
<p>Position 18°29'25"N, 64°22'55"W (customs dock)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This became a new Port of Entry from 1st March 2012.</p>
<p>See the main <a href="Countries/BritishVirginIslands?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/BVI/Formalities</strong></a> page for the full details.</p>
<p><span>If anchoring here for clearance, authorities request that you anchor off close to the dinghy dock (</span><span>just behind the small ferry dock right outside the blue Customs building - see photo below) any time of the day or night and fly the Q Flag. There is no such thing as a "no wake" zone, so this can be bumpy.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Night arrivals anchoring off Prickly Pear island (1/2 mile across the North Sound in sight of Gun Creek) with a Q-Flag flying may be fined by roving patrols. </span></span></p>
<p>The blue Customs building is open from 08:30 to 16:30 hrs Monday to Friday, and from 09:00 to 14:00 hrs Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Lunch time closure is 12:30 - 13:30.</p>
<p>Clearing in (or out) here is fast, efficient and friendly.</p>
<p>Ensure when you check in that you allow enough time to cruise the BVIs as whatever you say will be dated in your passport and subsequent extensions cost more money. <span>Payment needs to be paid in cash as there are currently no credit card facilities here.</span></p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/GunCreekOrientation_sized.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/><span>If anchoring just for clearance, see details above. If planning on staying a while, a more comfortable anchorage is on the </span><span>SE or NW side of the creek (in sand approx. 20ft.) </span><span>clear of the creek channel </span><span>to allow room for the frequent small ferries which ply the Sound. </span></p>
<p><span>There is a new superyacht marina to the E of Deep Bay.</span></p>
<p>If you prefer some privacy, anchor south of the Colquhoun Reef in Drake's Anchorage at Mosquito Island. This undeveloped island is owned by Sir Richard Branson and there is a landing stage.</p>
<p>Alternatively the anchorage to the SW of Eustacia can be quiet. There are alot of buildings on this island but most are unused and it is a short dinghy ride to excellent snorkelling on the reef. From here you can see Sir Richard Branson's (private) Necker Island and the remains of his house - which was struck by lightening in Hurricane Irene in 2011.</p>
