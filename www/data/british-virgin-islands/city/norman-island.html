<div class="hello"><div><p>The Bight at Norman Island is a favourite anchorage and is often the first stop on many itineraries. There are at least 60 moorings in the Bight and quite a few more have been dropped for the 2016 season, making anchoring difficult. <span>Just west of the Willie T is an anchoring spot with space for 3-4 boats.</span></p>
