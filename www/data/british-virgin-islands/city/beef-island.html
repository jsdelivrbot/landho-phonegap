<div class="hello"><div><p>Most cruisers visit Beef Island to either pick someone up from the airport (literally steps from the beach), or to enjoy the laid back atmosphere in Trellis Bay with its unique Full Moon Parties and arty shops.</p>
<p>Entering through the narrows between Beef Island and Camanoe Island, you can identify the 2 anchorages by the "forests" of masts. To the north is Marina Cay, and to the south Trellis Bay. Keep well to the east of the yellow markers off the end of the runway and the shoal areas around Bellamy Cay. There are red and green buoys on either side of the channel into the anchorage on the east side of the bay.</p>
<p>It is recommended that boats with a mast height of over 50' check with BVI aviation authorities on VHF 16 before approaching Trellis Bay.</p>
<p>Even after a major expansion a few years ago, Tortola's Beef Island airport does not accommodate major jets. Plans are in place to extend the runway nearly all the way to Sprat Point. It will leave Bellamy Cay intact, but will close off the existing entrances into Trellis Bay. A new channel will be dredged at Sprat Point for access to Trellis Bay.</p>
<p>Position 18° 27'N, 064° 31'54"W (entrance to Trellis Bay)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Trellis Bay is overcrowded with moorings, making finding an anchoring spot close to shore difficult.  Most boats anchor at the bay entrance where there is space and holding is good.</p>
<p>Moorings are tight, leaving not a lot of privacy, and are paid for ashore at the restaurant on Bellamy Cay or at De Loose Mongoose.</p>
<p>Shallow draft vessels might be able to find some space in the E/SE area of the bay, although it can get hot here behind Beef Island and mosquitos can be a menace.</p>
<p>The beach restaurants and arty shops are many and varied.  There is a small supermarket.</p>
<p>If leaving to go west is is possible in good light to go through the gap in the reef but most people take the sensible option of leaving the west cardinal mark to port - after this mark do not turn west too quickly as another reef runs out from the south of Little Camanoe.</p>
