<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of the BVIs see the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/BritishVirginIslands?rc=Formalities">BVIs Clearance section</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Note that the authorities here <span>do not use the Sailclear system, even though the BVIs are listed on the Sailclear website. </span></p>
<p>Offices are at the ferry dock at West End. Ferries from the US Virgin Islands stop here, which can mean clearance takes longer if a ferry arrives.</p>
<p><span>West End is a good base for an ESTA US visa waiver run (in other words, an easy way to get a US visa). Costs (2015) reported for 2 people are:</span><br/><span>ESTA fee: $28.00</span><br/><span>BVI Departure tax $20.00</span><br/><span>USVI Departure tax $40.00</span><br/><span>Ferry $120.00</span><br/><span>Total:  $208.00</span><br/><span>This is cheaper and much less time consuming than obtaining a full visa for the USA, but is only valid for 3 months.</span></p>
