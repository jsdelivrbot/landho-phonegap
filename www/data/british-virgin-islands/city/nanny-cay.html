<div class="hello"><div><p>Set in one of the finest and most central locations in the BVI, Nanny Cay is located on the South side of Tortola, between the capital Roadtown and West End. The marina provides some of the very best marine services and facilities in what is a top sailing destination. The island of Tortola itself is tropical, with many breath-taking sights and great places to visit. Nanny Cay has always been known as a well-protected marina, with beautiful surrounding hills and a relaxed feel about it.</p>
