<p>Customs and Immigration offices are in the same (white) building by the dock. Cruisers report that this is a great place to check in as it is on the beach.  There can be a delay if a USVI ferry has come in - then the Immigration officer is down at the pier. Otherwise all can be completed in five minutes.</p>
<p>Working hours:08:00 to 16:30 daily.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you cannot extend your visa here - for this you would need to go to Road Town or Spanish Town.</p>
<p>All official departments can be contacted on VHF channel 16.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Great Harbour is a spacious and sheltered anchorage, surrounded by small mountains, however holding here is uncertain and space restrictions could have you anchoring a long way out. Moorings now cover most of the bay and it is recommended cruising boats use these.</p>
<p>The entrance is straight-forward, but keep to the centre line, avoiding the large reef that extends 300 yards from the beach.</p>
<p><strong>Other Anchorages/Moorings on Jost Van Dyke</strong><br/><i> White Bay: </i>This<i> </i>is another popular anchorage on Jost Van Dyke which also has moorings buoys. It is protected by reefs. Contact Ivan's Stress Free Bar if wishing to use a mooring. Do not drop your anchor on the coral.</p>
<p><span><i>Diamond Cay</i>: This anchorage area lies at the extreme eastern end of Jost Van Dyke where it is connected by a shallow bar to Little Jost Van Dyke. </span><span>If wishing to use the buoys here, contact Foxy's Taboo Bar.</span></p>
<p><i>Little Harbour</i>: This is also at the eastern end of Jost Van Dyke. To use the buoys here, contact Abe's Place (for buoys on the eastern side) or Harris' Place for the others.</p>
<p><i>Green Cay:</i> Lies at the far east of the islands. It also has moorings but there is excellent holding inside them with a very short dinghy ride to the dock.  If you want to go hiking, snorkelling etc. this might be a preferred option.</p>
