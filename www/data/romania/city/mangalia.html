<div class="hello"><div><p>First founded in the 6th century BC, Mangalia is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Romania. Archaeological museums in the town display ancient Greek and Roman artifacts.</p>
<p>Mangalia is just 4M north of the border with Bulgaria and has a secure marina inside the commercial port, in the inner harbour. It is probably the safest place to leave a boat if exploring the interior or returning home for a while.</p>
<p>Position: 43°48’N, 28°35’E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry. See <a href="Countries/Romania/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Romania Formalities</strong></a> for details.</p>
<p>Proceed to the inner harbour ("tourist harbour") in this large, well buoyed commercial port used for ship building. Border Police and Customs/Immigration should be waiting on one of the pontoons. If not, they are located in a white metal container/office across from the Southerly pontoon.</p>
<p>If coming from another Romanian port, only a visit to the Border Police is required.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This marina is safe in all weather conditions and winds from all directions. Depths are 3.5m or more.</p>
<p>The inner harbour (called the "tourist harbour") has now been converted to a marina with floating pontoons. As you approach the marina looking for a berth an official will probably come out to assist.</p>
<p>Water and electricity are available alongside the pontoons as is free Wi-Fi. The marina office can be found to the left as you leave the pontoons which houses toilets and showers.</p>
<p>The pontoons are gated and, according to the officials, locked at night and guarded. The Harbourmaster will visit at some point. Cruisers report that docking fees seem negotiable.</p>
<p>The entire waterfront has been renovated over the last 5 years.</p>
