<p>Eforie Nord Marina <i>(photo from <span>Ioan Cobzarenco)</span></i></p>
<p>The entrance is silted every winter and occasionally even in summer after a strong wind. It needs to be dredged frequently in order to keep a fair depth. Prior to entry, you have to check the depth and position of the entrance channel with the marina office.</p>
<p>The approach must not be done when a swell is running. Be especially cautious in southerly winds and swell.</p>
<p>The small marina here is part of a resort hotel complex and has good security, but shelter is somewhat lacking. The swell inside of marina is very strong when the wind blows from the south-east.</p>
<p>Some of the surrounding hotels play very loud music well into the small hours of the morning, making sleep a veritable challenge at times.</p>
<p>Fuel is not available in any marina in Romania. You have to come prepared with jerry cans and manage their transport by taxi.</p>
<p>In town is good for groceries and supplies. There is an ATM at the hotel next to the marina and other services can be arranged with the marina office.</p>
