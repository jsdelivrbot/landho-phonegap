<div class="hello"><div><p><span>LifeHarbour Limanu is located in the Mangalia estuary, 3 NM west from the entrance to Mangalia Harbour.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p>Before entering the harbour you must keep clear of the SE pier where the water is very shallow. Follow the left channel marked with red and green buoys, as the right one leads into Marina Mangalia.You need to go past the Daewoo Shipyard which will be on your left, then you will pass under a bridge with a 20m clearance.</p>
