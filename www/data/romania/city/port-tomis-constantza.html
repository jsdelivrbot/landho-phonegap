<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Port Tomis is the name of the yacht harbour located in the ancient sea port of Constanta. It lies </span><span>4 NM North of the commercial port.</span></p>
<p><span>Constanta</span> has been a port since the 1st century BC and is the oldest city in Romania. The area around the marina is particularly attractive.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry. See <a href="Countries/Romania/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Romania Formalities</strong></a> for details.</p>
<p>Call on VHF Channel 67 on approach, but do not be surprised if no one responds. The harbour is serviced by the Border Police, housed in a white metal container about halfway along the East quay. It is best to tie up alongside the East quay, close to the sentry box, to complete formalities.</p>
<p>The friendly Border Police officer fills out the customs declaration and advise you that the Port Authorities may or may not visit the boat. If you are already cleared into Romania this is all that is required, if not, more formalities might be necessary.</p>
<p>On departure, inform the Border Police of your intended destination.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care to keep at least 1nm off the coast as the water is shallow close in.</p>
<p>This is an all-weather harbour and safe in winds from any direction. The entrance can be difficult to see until almost upon it, especially when arriving with the sun setting in the west. Use extra care and attention when arriving in strong S or SE winds.</p>
