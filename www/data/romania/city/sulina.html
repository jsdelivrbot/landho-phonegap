<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated at the end of the Sulina Canal, this port is one of the main outlets of the Danube River into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Danube River Delta is one of the best places in Europe and perhaps the
world for bird watching – local boats offer tours. For visiting nature
reserves in your own boat, a special permit is required and is issued in the town of Tulcia, 40 NM upstream.</p>
<p>If coming from the Black sea, locate the “safe water” buoy at N 45 08.075 and
E 29 47.613 then steer 301 M to enter the 5 mile long breakwater at the
mouth of the Sulina Canal - standard channel markings are in place at time of
writing. The town itself is another 2 miles upstream after the end of the
long breakwater. The current varies and depends on the time of year, winter
run off and recent rainfalls upstream. </p>
<p>Port of Sulina: 45° 09.4'N, 29° 39.2'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Romania/?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Romania Formalities</a> for details.</p>
<p>Tie up anywhere along the South shore where space is available. The best place is reported to be across from the "Restaurant Marea Neagra", where most
non-local pleasure boats tie up. </p>
<p>Customs and Immigration will come to the boat, usually a friendly local will notify them. Skippers then need to visit the Harbourmaster, who will issue a harbour permit at no charge. A completed crew list in duplicate in addition to the ships registration and valid insurance is required. It is helpful to have a ship’s stamp with the ships particulars on it (one cruiser reported he needed to use his stamp at least 10 times!).</p>
<p>On departure upstream, visit the Harbourmaster who will exchange the
harbour permit for a departure permit to be produced at the next port
upstream. </p>
<p>On departure for the Black Sea, visit the Harbourmaster who will issue a departure document and notify Customs and Immigration who will come to the boat to complete formalities.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Navigating in the river can be very difficult because of the strong current (see notes above in Location). Traffic on the river/canal is heavy at times ranging from medium sized ocean-going vessels to ferries and local boats. The local boats only have 2 settings on their engines, either dead stop or full speed, so wash can be a problem. Good fenders should solve most of the problem. </p>
<p>The Harbourmaster will come to the boat and collect US$10, or the equivalent
local currency. This pays for power when available and water. The water
seems to come from the firefighting water system and its quality or suitability
has not been verified. If leaving the boat for the day, be sure to inform the Harbourmaster.</p>
<p>Some of the restaurants and café’s along the waterfront have open Wi-Fi and there is a small produce market and a decent grocery store. You can find an ATM in town.</p>
<p>Diesel is available a little further upstream.</p>
