<li>Situated in Eastern Europe, Romania is a member of the European Union.</li>
<li>It has a small outlet to the Black Sea and the river Danube separating it from the Balkans, the country has always been at the crossroads of East and West. As the only Latin people in Eastern Europe, Romanians have always regarded themselves as different from their neighbours, but nearly half a century of communist rule has almost destroyed traditional life. The profound changes that followed the collapse of the former Soviet empire have allowed Romania to return to the European fold.</li>
<li>The Black Sea coast is flat and lacks natural harbours and anchorages, so from the cruising point of view, Romania has very little to offer with the possible exception of cruising the Danube Delta, one of the largest wildlife sanctuaries in Europe. The Danube itself is navigable along most of its length and yachts have successfully cruised down the Danube from Austria through the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania. Sailing the river in the opposite direction is difficult and slow because of the strong current. Boats coming from the Black Sea should enter the Danube at Sulina, from where a dredged branch of the river leads to Tulcea, 40 miles upriver. The trip offers a unique opportunity to see some of the Danube Delta.</li>
<li><span>Facilities for yachts are slowly becoming a reality: Mangalia has finger pontoons; Port Tomis also has pontoons (both with hook-ups for water and electricity); in Sulina electricity is available.</span></li>
<li>Cruising information for Bulgaria and Romania is difficult to find. Cruisers report that Romania has changed a lot since "Cruising Bulgaria and Romania" by Nicky Allardice was published in 2006 and much of the information is out of date. A better, more up to date source is to be found in the RCCPF guide, The Black Sea. See <a href="Countries/Romania/?rc=GeneralInfo#Publications"><strong>publications</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Main-Danube Canal:</strong> Romania can now be reached by a more direct way than through the Mediterranean thanks to the opening of the 107 mile long Main-Danube Canal. This new canal has made it possible to sail across the entire continent of Europe, from the mouth of the Rhine, on the North Sea, to the mouth of the Danube, on the Black Sea. The 2179 mile long waterway can be used by boats drawing not more than 8 ft (2.5 m) and with an air clearance of 19.5 ft (6 m), so as to be able to pass under the many bridges. Some of the bridges in Yugoslavia were destroyed during the NATO bombing of 1999 and until the situation returns to normal river traffic has been severely restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Danube-Black Sea Canal:</strong> Cruising yachts may use this Canal, which starts near Constanta and bypasses the Danube Delta. There are certain height restrictions both in the Canal and on the Danube and most yachts will have to lower their masts before entering the Canal.</li>

<div><p>The climate is typically temperate with hot summers and cold winters. The winds along the Black Sea coast are very much influenced by the surrounding landmass and in summer there is a daily pattern of land and sea breezes. An onshore breeze comes up around midday and usually dies by dusk to be followed by a land breeze during the night.</p>
<p>Weather broadcasts are at 10:04, 16:04, 20:04, and 04:04 local time on VHF 25.</p>
