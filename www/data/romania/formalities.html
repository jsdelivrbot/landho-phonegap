<div><p>Clearance formalities for visiting yachts are generally straightforward.</p>
<p>Yachts must clear in and out of each port. Crew should remain on board until formalities have been completed.</p>
<p>On arrival at any of the ports a yacht will be visited by Border Police (Immigration), Customs and Health. They will want to see a completed crew list in duplicate in addition to the ships registration and valid insurance, plus the Customs declaration. It is helpful to have a ship’s stamp with the ships' particulars on it.</p>
<p>On departure for the next port in Romania, or on leaving the country, all the visits are repeated and an exit stamp added.</p>
<p>Once the formalities are completed a Clearance Permit is given by Harbourmaster to sail from each port to the next port or country. Agents are not mandatory and there is no charge for formalities.</p>
