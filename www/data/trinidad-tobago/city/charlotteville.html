<div class="hello"><div><p>Charlotteville is a quiet, fishing village on the NE tip of Tobago. It's reported to be a very beautiful and peaceful anchorage, popular with French yachts.</p></div></div>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TrinidadTobago?rc=Formalities">Trinidad &amp; Tobago Formalities</a></strong> for complete clearance information.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Offically you should go alongside the Immigration jetty for clearance with Customs and Immigration (in that order!) and this <strong>should</strong> be done before getting permission to proceed to any anchorage or other mooring. However, the dock here is unsuitable for yachts and you will be in the way of the fishing boats.</p>
<p>The skipper <strong>and</strong> all the crew must immediately go ashore to clear in. This applies day or night, 24/7. However, again, Immmigration hours of opening are very sporadic (see comments at bottom of page).</p>
<p>A "navigation fee" of about US$8 per month is levied on all boats in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>A yacht must normally clear out from the same port at which it arrived, but it is possible to clear out from Scarborough if Customs are advised before leaving Charlotteville of the exact date. This may also be alot easier due to the irregular hours that the authorities practice here.</p>
<p>With permission, you may depart Charlotteville and overnight in Crown Point but you cannot land at all  and must leave by daybreak the following morning.</p>
<p>If you wish to circumnavigate the island you must file a passage plan and when on the southern coast you need to check into and out of Scarborough as it is a different jusisdiction from Charlotteville.  Sailing like this is refered to as "Bay Hopping" but you <strong>must</strong> get permission to do it. Be especially careful if leaving for Trinidad.  If you stop en route without permission you will be in trouble on arrival in Trinidad.</p>
<p>When sailing to Trinidad, you must gain clearance from both the Immigration &amp; Customs office with endorsements allowing the vessel to sail to the port of Chaguaramas. If the vessel was cleared to sail to Chaguaramas from Tobago, then the skipper is obligated to report to the Chaguaramas Customs &amp; Immigration office upon arrival.</p>
<p>You may NOT drop anchor en route along the north coast of Trinidad but must proceed directly to Chaguaramas. This is a security reason and for your own safety.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Charlotteville has a good, but deep, protected anchorage with a long-term community of cruisers.</p>
<p>Anchor north of the imaginary line extending from the end of the jetty to the northern point of Pirates Bay. Do not anchor inside this line. If you search around north of this line, it is possible to find depths of 45 feet in which to anchor. You will also find the breeze is more consistent and cooling north of the line and you should be out of the insect range. Take care that your anchor or chain do not damage any coral.</p>
<p>If you go in too close to shore (less than 40' of water) you will be in  coral.  45'-60' has you on a nice sandy ledge with good holding with  proper scope.  It is a little shallower if you go by the town beach, but  more exposed to any swell.  Also, if you try to anchor in the cove at  Pirates Bay, the fishermen will ask you move.</p>
<p>You must not discharge black water into the bay or any swimming areas.</p>
<p>When going ashore, it is advisable to pull your dinghy up onto the beach on the inside of the town jetty. Those tied to the lower dock often get sucked under it and capsize, or there is a danger it will be vandalised by local youths jumping off the dock into vacant dinghies (see comments below).</p>
<p>Alternatively secure it at Workshop Seatours. There is a grocery store here also.</p>
