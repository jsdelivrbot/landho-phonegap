<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is the best protected anchorage on the island, with good holding in sand. </span>There are also free mooring buoys available to visitors.</p>
<p>In 2011 Jet Skis were banned in Store Bay, however it appears this ban has been lifted, making this a not-so-peaceful anchorage.</p>
<p>There is restricted anchoring in the vicinity of Pigeon Point and Buccoo Reef and vessels (including dinghies) must not enter or anchor without permission of the Minister. There are now patrols policing this and if found in this area, sailors can face summary conviction and fines of up to $6,000.</p>
<p><b>Security Concern:</b><br/> There is an unsavory individual who hangs around the Store Bay anchorage (on the park bench next to Bago's Beach Bar). He goes by several different names - Allergy, Ron, Excel. Toyha or Michael. He might offer drugs, a rental car or an Island tour.
