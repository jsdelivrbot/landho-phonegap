<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying about 80 miles south of Grenada, Chaguaramas is a sheltered bay. It lies on the extreme western end of Trinidad's northern coast, about 10nm from Port-of-Spain. The approach is via the narrow Boca (be aware of strong currents).</p>
<p><span>The majority of boat yards and marine services are located in Chaguaramas.</span></p>
<p>Position 10°40.5'W, 61°38.3'W.</p>
<p><strong>Safety &amp; Security</strong></p>
<p>In the past much has been reported about crime and theft towards yachties in Chaguaramas. While unemployment has triggered an increase in theft from yachts in the Chaguaramas area over the past few years, one must note that Trinidad has the highest concentration of boats for hurricane season in the Caribbean. Co-operation between the local marine business community, the cruising community and the authorities has improved the situation considerably. Security patrols at night have helped to reduce the number of thefts from boats here, this is IN ADDITION to the security service that each and every yard and marina has, however thefts do still occur.</p>
<p>A good source of up-to-date security information by cruisers is the Yahoo <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/trinidadcruisingsailorsforum/"><strong>Trinidad for Cruising Sailors Forum</strong></a>.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Their are a number of marinas here, all with varying levels of security. Transient berths are is demand so booking in advance, if possible, may be advisable.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong></p>
<p>There are about 25 cylindrical mooring buoys in the anchorage area controlled by YSATT. These are checked monthly for wear and tear. Moorings can not be reserved in advance of arrival; they are strictly accommodated on a first come first served basis. Upon arrival in Trinidad, contact the YSATT office or speak to the water taxi operator to advise of your need for a mooring. See <a href="http://www.ysatt.org/moorings.htm"><strong>YSATT moorings</strong></a> for more information.</p>
<p>There may also be other moorings for rent in the bay.</p>
<p>If using these moorings, be aware that while it can blow for days from the east with flat seas, when a W or NW wind blows the bay is wide open and provides no protection. The seas and surge make up quickly and one must be careful to secure the mooring lines to prevent chafe.</p>
<p>The Trinidad and Tobago Sailing Association in Harts Bay also have mooring buoys available, however this is not in Chaguarmas. Prices are cheap, however facilities are basic and there is no security.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><strong>The harbour is deep and the holding can be poor. Beware of a <span>sunken barge at Latitude 10-40.465N, Longitude 61-38.319W. It is in 70ft of water but can snag anchors.</span></strong></p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor off the town or close to Carenage Bay. The bay can be rolly in a southerly wind as well as uncomfortable due to the number of craft operating around the bay at high speed. Be sure to anchor in the designated anchorage area.</p>
<p>Another option is to anchor in Escondida Cove. It is exposed in westerly winds but otherwise, well sheltered.</p>
<p>The YSATT shuttle (water taxi) operates from 0730 to 2230 Monday to Saturday and can be called via VHF, call sign "YSATT Shuttle", on Channel 68. It is available for any journey within the bay. The shuttle became privately owned in October 2007, and now charges from TT$10/person to TT$30/person, depending on how far out into the bay you are going. Bookings can be made in advance for trips on Sundays and public holidays.<strong> Note:</strong> It has been reported (April 2015) that this water taxi is out of service, but there others available.</p>
<p>Note that Chaguaramas is a commercial harbour, and there are frequent oil and diesel spills here. Also there are party boats that play loud music until well into the night.</p>
