                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>Yachts entering Trinidad territorial waters should call coastguard control on Channel 16 to advise of the yacht's arrival and to give an ETA.</p>
<p>Fly the <code>Q</code> flag.</p>
<p><b>Overtime</b></p>
<p><span>If you arrive or depart Trinidad Waters outside of regular office hours <span>(0800-1200, 1300-1600 Mon-Fri, except public holidays</span>), you will be charged overtime. It is therefore </span><span>advisable to time your arrival and departure within normal office hours</span><span> </span></p>
<p><b>Inward Clearance</b></p>
<p><span>Customs is open 24/7 and it is important to visit them </span><strong>immediately</strong><span> on arrival even if Immigration is closed. </span><span>Once a vessel has entered territorial waters, the captain </span><strong>and</strong><span> the crew must check in with 24 hours of arrival.</span></p>
<p>Arriving yachts should clear at either Chaguaramas in Trinidad or Scarborough  or Charlotteville in Tobago. Port of Spain is a commercial port, and yachts may only stop there in real emergencies. Chaguaramas has an office dedicated to clearance formalities.</p>
<p><span>Yachts are required to check in/out when moving between Trinidad and Tobago.</span></p>
<p>Yachts sailing from Trinidad to Tobago must get the "Arrival Form" endorsed by the Customs officer in Chaguaramas. This form must be presented to Customs on arrival at Scarborough or Charlotteville. The same procedure is necessary for the reverse voyage. <span>Be sure to make sure your paperwork is all in order before moving between the two islands as penalities for incorrect paperwork can be harsh (see this </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TrinidadTobago#1421253054209594">comment</a></strong><span>). </span></p>
<p>With permission from the Customs officer in Trinidad you can anchor elsewhere in Tobago, such as Store Bay, and go overland to Scarborough to complete the necessary formalities.</p>
<p>Once in Tobago, Customs will require a 'float plan' complete with the dates on which you will be at various destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Outward clearance</strong></p>
<p>Yachts must clear out of one of the two recommended ports. Yachts clear out with Customs, Immigration and Port Authority. Whilst Immigration give you 24 hours to depart Trinidad Waters, Customs only give you 4 hours.</p>
<p>You may NOT drop anchor en route along the north coast of Trinidad but must proceed directly to Chaguaramas. This is a security reason and for your own safety.</p>
<p>If departing for Grenada, it is now possible to file a passage plan with the coastguard. See report <a href="Members/sue/R2010-03-25-3"><strong>here</strong></a> for further details.</p>

                Immigration
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>Passport must be valid for 6 months beyond the intended stay (3 months for citizens of USA, EU and the British Commonwealth).</p>
<p><span>Ebola Outbreak: Entry restrictions may apply if you ordinarily live in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, or you have visited any of those countries in the previous 28 days.</span></p>
<p>Visas <span>for visits of up to 90 days </span><span>are not required by citizens of the United States, the Caricom countries (except Haiti), European Union and British Commonwealth </span><strong>with the exception</strong><span> of the following countries:-</span></p>
<p>Czech Republic,  Estonia,  Hungary, Latvia,  Lithuania,  Poland,  Slovakia,  Slovenia,  Australia,  Cameroon,  India,  Mozambique,  New Zealand,  Nigeria,  Papua New Guinea,  South Africa,  Sri Lanka,  Tanzania and  Uganda.</p>
<p>Australian crew on yachts are also <strong>not required</strong> to have a visa, however Australian tourists entering by plane or ferry do require visas.</p>
<p>Upon entry to the country, Immigration normally provides for an approved stay of 3 to 6 months. Visas may be extended for another three months if you have a reasonable reason (hurricane season, work on the boat etc.). One week prior to expiration an extension may be requested. You are likely to be asked to return on Tuesday of the following week, at which time an extension may be granted upon payment of the applicable fee.</p>
<p>Immigration (and Customs) will charge overtime outside of the normal working hours, which are 0800-1200, 1300-1600 Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Crew departing Trinidad and Tobago by air must be signed off the vessel and signed on again when returning. The procedure requires a letter prepared by the marina or boatyard, which must be approved by the Immigration officer. This approval allows for proper paperwork at the airport (or other port of exit) and an exclusion of the airport tax if executed within 24 hours of departure. This letter must be in the hands of the crew prior to departure to enable embarkation without a return ticket. This same letter will be used as authorisation for re-entry into Trinidad to rejoin the vessel. When the crew returns to Trinidad and Tobago, the master must present the crew's passport to the Immigration officer at the Chaguaramas station within 24 hours to sign the crew back on the vessel.</p>
<p>There is a similar procedure for crew transferring to another boat.<br/> <strong>Important note:</strong> A crew member may not sign on to a vessel that is staying longer than the one on which he arrived.</p>
<p>Immigration requires a Medical Certificate for persons who wish to remain in Trinidad &amp; Tobago for periods exceeding one year. Declaration by applicant must be made in the presence of the Examining Medical Officer.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>You <strong>must</strong> report to Customs immediately you arrive, even if Immigration is closed.</p>
<p>Note that on checking-out of Trinidad, Customs give you 4 hours to depart.</p>
<p>If your arrival or departure time is outside of business hours (i.e. <span>08:00 - 12:00, 13:00 - 16:00 Monday to Friday), you will be charged overtime fees.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Firearms</strong></em><br/> Firearms and ammunition must be declared on arrival and will be taken by the Customs boarding officer and placed in custody at the central police station.</p>
<p>Requests for their return prior to departure must be made to Customs at least 48 hours before clearance (preferably longer). Failure to do so may result in a delay to departure or departure without the firearms. To keep firearms in your possession during the stay, it is necessary to apply to the Commissioner of Police for a licence.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fruit &amp; Vegetables</strong></em><br/> Fruits, plants and plant material must be inspected by a plant quarantine officer before being landed. Honey from other islands may not be allowed.</p>
<p>Any alcohol on board should also be declared.</p>
<p><em><strong>Temporary Importation of Yachts</strong></em><br/> Yachts are admitted duty-free for a reasonable period of time. Boats stored for longer terms must be left in the care of an approved yard. Some formalities must be completed at Customs, including a full inventory of items on board.</p>
<p>If a yacht is left unattended, it will be necessary to complete formalities for temporary importation. This is normally carried out through Chaguaramas Customs station.</p>
<p><em><strong>Importing Yacht Parts</strong></em><br/> Boat parts and spares for yachts in transit <strong>may</strong> be imported free of duty by following the recommended procedure by Customs. Only items deemed to be yacht parts can be imported duty free. The treatment of anything else will depend on the officer in charge at the time.</p>
<p>Only the captain of the vessel is allowed to carry duty free parts from the airport to Chaguaramas Customs station, where they will be transferred on board.</p>
<p>Parts arriving by courier will be delivered to Chaguaramas Customs station. Parcels arriving via the postal service will come to the Carenage Post Office, which will notify the yacht, after which the parcel will be cleared at the Ajax Street post office in Port of Spain.</p>
<p>It is <strong>very</strong> important that not only the parcel be marked <code>Yacht in Transit</code>, but ALL the paperwork be also so marked.</p>
<p>There is no longer any overtime charge for the Customs inspection of imported spare parts.</p>
<p>Large items (eg dinghy, engine etc.) can be purchased free of tax by providing a set of your ship’s papers and declaring the purchase is for a yacht in transit. The same is true if you contract for a large job like a set of sails or a new teak deck; you will not have to pay any tax.</p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Both islands of Trinidad &amp; Tobago are areas of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
