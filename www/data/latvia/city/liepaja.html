<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an important ice-free port on the Baltic Sea, located in the far south-west corner of Latvia at position 56°31' N; 21°01' E. Although a manufacturing town, it is also a cultural centre with plenty of music and a lively night-life. It has an excellent beach.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is best to approach through the southern entrance in the long breakwater protecting the port. Take care to follow the  buoyed channel, which leads to the Tirdzniecibas Kanal, as there are shallow patches as well as wrecks to avoid. The moorings are close to the city centre, on the sta’bd side, just before the bridge. </p>
<p>A night entry is also possible.</p>
<p>The Guest harbour office and all facilities (showers, WC etc.) are in the basement of the Promenade Hotel. </p>
