<div class="hello"><div><p>Ventspils is an important port in northwestern Latvia, at the mouth of the Venta River.</p>
<p><span>There are two approach channels to the Port. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The NW approach channel leads SE from Lighted Buoy </span><span>'B' (57*28.52'N, 21*25.91'E) to the Outer Harbour of </span><span>Ventspils protected by two, N and S, breakwaters, and then into the Fishing Harbour and </span><span>marina located in the S side of the River Venta estuary. </span></p>
<p><span>Another option is available by </span><span>choosing the Lighted Buoy 'A' (57*26.3'N, 21*24.7'E) which marks the seaward entrance of </span><span>the W approach channel. </span></p>
<p><span>Both approach channels are indicated by lighted ranges. The rear</span><br/><span>range light of the NW channel is shown from a prominent framework tower, 35m high, </span><span>standing 1.5 miles SE of the harbour entrance. </span><span>The port of Ventspils can be identied from a considerable distance by a conspicuous </span><span>church, with a tall spire, standing in the centre of the town on the S side of the river. A</span><br/><span>conspicuous pilot watch tower, 20m high, stands close E of the root of the S breakwater. A </span><span>prominent group of storage tanks is situated near the root of the N breakwater.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/latvia-pics/latvia_ventspils-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>The length of the entrance channel is 5.5 km, with an approximate depth of slightly over 17m. The port becomes shallower all the time and the Ventspils marina (see photo) has a depth of 3.6m.</span></p>
<p><span>The tides are </span><span>negligible, but the water level fluctuates with wind conditions and may differ by 0.3m above </span><span>or below the mean level.
