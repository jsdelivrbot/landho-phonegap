<ul>
<li>Latvia lies on the Baltic between Estonia, Russia and Lithuania. Although it offers fewer cruising opportunities than its neighbours, the capital Riga is one of the most attractive cities in Europe. The city lies on the banks of the river Daugava and its old district has a medieval flavour that has miraculously been unaffected by its recent Soviet past.</li>
<li>Latvia became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. </li>
<li>Riga, and the Andrejosta Yacht Centre in particular, has the best facilities for visiting yachts. The marina is close to the centre of town and has marina type facilities. Repair facilities are limited, but the yacht club will help if necessary and will also arrange deliveries of fuel. The port of Roja now also has some repair facilities.</li>
<li>The ports of Ventspils and Liepaja are commercial harbours and are both are currently improving facilities for yachts. There is a designated dock for visiting yachts at Liepaja, and yacht harbours at Ventspils and Jaurmala, a few miles west of Riga.</li>
<li>Latvia have many attractive fishing ports which are worth visiting, but good, updated charts (the Russian ones are best) are essential due to the shallow waters.</li>
