            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p align="justify">One of the most popular Cuban ports of entry for boats arriving from the north is Marina Hemingway. The harbour for the marina is in fact called Santa Fe, and whilst it's the closest marina to Havana, it is nine miles west along the coast from the city.</p>
<p align="justify">Marina Hemingway can cater for approx. 150 boats, and the majority of slips now have both water and/or electricity. But be aware that this marina was built in the 1950s and not a huge amount has been invested since, so it is showing its age.</p>
<p align="justify">More than 50% of the berths are permanently occupied, the rest are for transients. As there is no alternative port within 70 miles east or west,<strong> be sure to check there is available space prior to arrival.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Havana's architecture reflects three principal periods in Cuba's history: Spanish colonial, American neo-colonial and revolutionary. The core of Old Havana (Habana Vieja), which occupies the western side of the long narrow entrance to Havana harbour, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.</p>
<p align="justify">The restoration of Old Havana  continues and many of the old narrow streets have now been pedestrianised making a stroll around the old city much more enjoyable.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Approaches</strong></p>
<p>From Marathon or Key West, one passes Havana itself, angling in to the coast and approaching Marina Hemingway which is some 9 miles further West of the City. There is a sea-buoy off the entry-channel to the marina which can be hard to find visually against the back-drop of low buildings, trees and the white-water surf along the beach.</p>
<p>There are reefs on either side of the entrance, which is difficult to identify until fairly close in. With an onshore wind, which is the usual direction during winter months, entering the marina is not easy and in strong winds and breaking seas, should not be attempted nor is a night entry safe to attempt.</p>
<p>Contact the marina on approach for entry instructions. <br/><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The mark shown on charts as G7 is referred to in the instructions issued by the marina as G9. This can cause confusion if you are trying to match your chart with the directions given.</span></li>
<li><span>Be sure to check your drift. There is a strong east to west current and the channel is only about 100' wide at the entrance.</span></li>
<li><span>Stay as close to the center line as possible. The red side channel marks can drift slightly and can be slightly behind the reef so don't be tempted to get too close to the marks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Position <span>23°05.3'N, <span>82°30.6'W (sea buoy)</span></span></p></div></div>

<p>Most visiting yachts try and enter at the large Hemingway Marina as the officials are used to dealing with foreign boats and are friendly and efficient. They speak good English.</p>
<p>It has been reported that it's best to wait until you are fairly close to the Marina before calling them on VHF Ch. 16 as the Harbourmaster who answers and can speak English, operates with a hand-held VHF.  The marina also uses Channel 68, as a working channel, and 2790 kHz.</p>
<p>If you don't receive an answer, don't worry, it's highly likely the authorities are aware you are coming and will be ready to receive you.</p>
<p>There is a Customs dock in the entrance channel to the marina, just past the flag poles (but you can also stop anywhere along the seawall). <span>Put your fenders at least 1 foot higher on your vessel than normal. C</span><span>learance formalities are completed here, after which a yacht is assigned a place in the marina.</span></p>

<p>The marina has a good range of services and Yacht Services Inc. is a useful source on local conditions. Boats can be hauled out by crane here and this is also a good place to store the boats ashore.</p>
<p>In 2016 marina berthing rates have increased substantially. See this <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cuba/havana-marina-hemingway-updates/">April 2016 cruising repor</a></strong>t for details.</p>
<p>The two hotels by the marina both play loud music, so try and get a berth away from them if wanting some peace.</p>
<p>From the Marina there is a shuttle bus for <span>1cuc to the "Playa" from where you can get the double decker tourist bus to Old Havana for 5cuc. Both are hop-on hop-off and tickets are valid all day.</span></p>

      Whilst prices have risen, facilities here are poor. The north side of canal #2 is the most convenient, being closest to the showers (still quite a long walk!). Take your own toilet paper and hand soap.<br>
No pool available to marina users, however the Hotel Acuario charge $20 CuC/person/day to use their swimming pool. Fuel still available here. Security presence has been reduced at this marina, so locking your boat at all times is recommended.
