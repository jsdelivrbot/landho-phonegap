<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage is on the SW coast of the mainland. It is on the east side of a very wide bay and is exposed, potentially, to everything other than easterlies.</p>
<p>This area is part of the <span>Cabo Corrientes Natural Reserve and the </span>anchorage is among coral and care needs to be taken.</p>
<p>There is a small dock just to the north of the anchorage for use by the Dive Resort boats only. Cruisers are welcomed at the dive resort which offers restaurants, rooms, a bar and laundry.</p>
<p>There is no fuel or electricity available. Jerry jug water is possible.</p>
<p>There are no public transport links, however, car hire is possible from the dive resort.</p>
