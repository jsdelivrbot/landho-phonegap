<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Baracoa is a city in Guantánamo Province near the eastern tip of Cuba. It was founded by the first governor of Cuba, the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in August 15 of 1511 and is the oldest Spanish settlement in Cuba. </span></p>
<p><span>This unspoilt colonial town, rarely visited by tourists, is well worth a visit.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a commercial dock here but yachts need to anchor.</p>
<p>The bay is very sheltered but is rolly in NE swells. There is good holding in the sand at a depth of about 4m in the south eastern corner of the bay, but keep away from the shallows near the shores.</p>
