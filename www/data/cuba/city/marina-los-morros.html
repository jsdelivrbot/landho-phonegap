<div class="hello"><div><p>This not a protected marina. Docking consists of one long dock previously used for fishing and commercial boats. There is no breakwater and in any weather it is not safe to stay there. It is possible the anchor in the bay close by, but it is reported that the holding is poor.</p>
<p>It is remote, and there are no facilities other than a bar and restaurant. Fuel is available here (2012).</p>
<p>Last updated February 2013.</p></div></div>
