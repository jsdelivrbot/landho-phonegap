<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Located on the south of Cuba in the Los Canarreos archipelago.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cuba/?rc=Formalities">Cuba Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed information on clearing into and out of Cuba.</span></p>
<p>The marina monitors VHF Channel 16 and being used to yachts, formalities are relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>You can enter the marina and tie up for your clearing in formalities, but you do not have to stay. Alternatively, anchor and dinghy in with your papers. You <i><strong>may</strong></i> be able to persuade the Guarda to clear you in without boarding the boat.</p>
<p><span>Cayo Largo is a good place to extend your tourist visa because all of the requisite services are in the same place.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The channel to the marina is buoyed, but is both shallow and narrow in places (see <a href="Countries/Cuba/two-months-cruising-cuba"><strong>adjacent report</strong></a>).</p>
<p>There is a concrete dock and two floating docks with slips, some of which are in a very bad state of repair. <span>The visitors dock is the eastern most dock system and the easiest docks to get in and out of are the ones on the east side. Be careful not to go too wide if you use the east docks, because there is a mud bank with small mangroves that is very hard to see about 100 ft off the docks.</span></p>
<p><span>It may be advisable to anchor off and do a survey by dinghy before entering.</span></p>
<p><span> Available water is not potable and the power supply is extremely variable (reported to be more "off" than "on"). </span></p>
<p><span>There is fuel available here, a <span>bar/restaurant, a small convenience store that sells a few expensive staples and a decent selection (for Cuba) of wines and spirits. Fresh bread is also available, but it must be reserved. There is also a bank.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note there is no fishing permitted at Cayo Largo. There are game wardens on duty and they will confiscate your equipment if they catch you fishing.</span></span></span></p>
