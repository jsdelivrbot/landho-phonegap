<div class="hello"><div><p>Varadero lies about 70nm east of Havana on Cuba's north coast.</p>
<p>Take care when sailing close to Cayo Piedras. There are hidden concrete and steel blocks (surplus building material) close to the shore at the SW of the Guarda Fronteras base NE of Varadero.</p>
<p>Until further notice the only Marina in Varadero is Marina Gaviota on the extreme north east end of the Hicacos Peninsula. <span>The approach to Gaviota is well marked with large metal buoys that are lit and radar reflector equipped. The difficult part is the entrance to Bahia Cardenas which is straight forward, but best left for daylight as you need to avoid a shoal that extends eastward from Cayo Piedra del Norte.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 23° 11'N, 81° 07'W (entrance)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cuba/?rc=Formalities">Cuba Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed information on clearing into and out of Cuba.</span></p>
<p>Marina Dársena de Varadero <span>is still closed to international arrivals until further notice. </span><span>Vessels can only enter this marina if the boat has been in Cuba for a minimum of 30 days.</span></p>
<p><span>Marina Gaviota has the </span><span>Guarda Frontera (who deal with </span><span>Customs and Immigration) on site and they are available 24/7. The first person you will see is the doctor to do a quarantine inspection. It is likely all officials will come to the boat. Fees can be paid in USD cash at a discounted rate of 12.5%. This is the only marina in Cuba where this is possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you enter the marina basin the clearance dock is immediately to the right. You will see a long floating dock in front of three small shed like structures. The sheds are the offices of the government agencies. The procedure is to med moor at the clearance dock and then move to a transient mooring after the formalities are completed. The authorities are very friendly and professional and the clearing in should not take more than an hour. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><strong>Marina Dársena de Varadero</strong><br/></span><span>Vessels can only enter this marina if the boat has been in Cuba for a minimum of 15 days. Docking prices are rising, yet facilities remain poor.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Marina Gaviota</strong><br/>Tucked just inside the extreme <span>north east end of the Hicacos Peninsula. Rather remote. T<span>o get to the farmers markets or to meet Cubans who are not working in the resorts requires either a $5 hour-long bus ride followed by a 20 minute walk, or a $25 taxi ride (that could easily cost much more if you are not careful).</span></span></span></p>
<p>That said, Marina Gaviota is a modern facility <span>with good installations on new floating concrete docks.<span> There are restaurants around the marina and a well stocked grocery store. </span></span><span>Security at night is fine, but during the day tourists come onto the docks for the dive/fishing boats, so it can get busy.</span></p>
<p>Varadero is a holiday town with  hotels, restaurants and banks. There are a couple of cash machines near to the  bus station.</p>

All facilities, showers, laundry, bar and restaurant, Wi-fi available for $2 CUC/hour (buy your cards at the front desk of the Melia). Dive centre. Facilities are good and well appointed but scattered all around the marina so a bike is useful!<br>

Boatyard with travel hoist and repair services. Haulout and storage fees (in paved yard) reported to be very reasonable. DIY or local workers available. Bring your own materials.

      Whilst this marina is still closed to International Arrivals (July 2016) the 30 day quarantine has now been reduced to 15 days. This means a boat that has been in Cuban waters for 15 days can now enter the marina facilities.<br>
The approach to Marina Darsena is via a canal at the western end of the Varadero Peninsular (23°07.6'N, 81°18.4'W).<br>
Services include water, fuel, electricity, cruisers' lounge, chandlery, and some repair facilities.<br>
The marina is about 10 mins. from the town of Santa Marta which has a small market, various shops, horse drawn carts everywhere and a small bank. Varadero is a two mile walk away.
