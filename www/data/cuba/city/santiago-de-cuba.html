<div class="hello"><div><p>The Marina Punta Gorda is located in Gaspar Cove, close to the entrance of the Bahia de Santiago de Cuba, which is Cuba's second largest city.</p>
<p>The city itself especially beautiful with a huge range of architecture, however sadly it is in various states of decay and nothing has been painted is 30 years.</p>
<p>There is a lot of history on the revolution and of course the famous pilgrimage site "El Cobre". Be prepared to step back 60 years in time with old cars and trucks and horse drawn carriages.</p>
<p>Position 19° 58'N, 75° 52'21"W (entrance to the Bahia)</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cuba/?rc=Formalities">Cuba Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed information on clearing into and out of Cuba.</span></p>
<p>On arrival <span>you will be hailed on the radio by the Guarda Frontera and instructed to anchor in the "quarantine" area on the other side of the harbour (approx. a mile from the marina). A health inspector will come on board to check everyone on board is fit and well and inspect the fresh food on board.</span></p>
<p><span>You can then head to the marina. <span>Marina staff are very welcoming. Call Marina Punta Gorda on Channel 16 between 1800 and 0800, otherwise CH 72.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span>Other officials will come to the boat. Clearance <b>can</b> involve up to 6 different people and a fair amount of paperwork. The entire procedure will take between 3 and 5 hours - be patient.</p>
<p>Expect three sniffer dogs which will not have shoes. Handheld VHFs, GPS, flares and Very pistols are wrapped and sealed and must not be taken ashore.</p>
<p>The marina <span>may be able to change money for you so you can pay clearance fees. If not, they will give you time to go into the City to change money.</span></p>
<p>Note that if you declare that you have come from Haiti you will be put on "Cholera Watch" - all crew temperatures to be taken every four hours and logged until the Sanitary Department say you are clear.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/cuba-pics/cuba_marina-punta-gorda_sy-calliope/@@images/image/preview"/>Call the marina on CH 16 between 1800 and 0800, otherwise CH 72 <i>(photo courtesy of SY Calliope 2015)</i>.</p>
<p>The marina has two rather rough piers - be sure to have good fenders. Holding either side of the pier is patchy and you will need to ensure your anchor is well dug in as the winds will turn through 360 degrees in the course of the day.</p>
<p>There is a charge for anchoring out (approx. half that of taking a berth). The cove nearby is very deep (50ft +), however depths of 17-20ft can be found just off the marina. If at anchor you may only dinghy in to the marina - the naval police will prevent you from going anywhere else.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that yellow soot from the cement factory close by will stain your decks.</p>
<p>Showers and toilets at the marina are poor (cold water, no toilet seats or paper).  WATER IS A PROBLEM HERE. Frequently the water is off; sometimes for two days at a time. There is a fuel dock, however the fuel pumps are out of commission and have been for a long time.</p>
<p>There is a restaurant (open 10am to 4pm) and bar at the marina. There is also a hotel bar just a short walk down the road. The marina gates are locked at 10pm.</p>
<p>Be aware that as soon as you step outside the marina grounds you will be hassled by people asking for things. The marina can order a taxi for a ride into the city. It takes about 20 minutes.</p>
