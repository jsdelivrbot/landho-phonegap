<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../cuba-pics/cuba_puerto-vita_sv-lily-2015/@@images/image/preview"/>The entrance channel to the port is narrow but well marked. If help is required to navigate up the channel<span>, call for assistance on VHF channel 13 or 16.</span></p>
<p>The marina is very well sheltered, even in a hurricane. Yachts are Med-moored here (<i>see photo courtesy of SY Lily who visited here in 2015</i>). It is rather isloated however, so a hire car is probably a good idea for re-provisioning and getting around. Holquin is 20km away.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage with a water taxi service.</p>
<p>Some repairs are possible.</p>
