<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying on the southern coast of the island, the town of Cienfuegos is some 1.5 miles inland from the port. You can either walk there in 20 minutes, take a bicycle taxi or horsedrawn carriage. The town centre is beautifully restored with lots of colonial buildings.</p>
<p>This is a good place for exploring more of Cuba overland as there are three car hire companies within walking distance of the port, and it is just a 3 hour drive to Havana.</p>
<p>Position 22°07’.50 N, 80°27’.20 W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/cuba-pics/cuba_cienfuegos_marine-docks/@@images/image/mini"/>The marina has good solid concrete berths. With a strong Southerly wind there tends to be some swell. All personnel speak good English. The channel to the marina is well marked. Unfortunately, latest reports are that the majority of space here is taken up with charter companies, so it has very few berths for visiting yachts.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/cuba-pics/cuba_cienfuegos_anchorage/@@images/image/mini"/>The anchorage here has good holding. When going ashore, dinghies can be left <span>on the beach beside the main marina office. This beach is actually outside the fenced secure area, so you will need a long chain to loop around a tree to secure your dinghy. The marina charges a fee for anchoring, but does allow use of their bathroom facilities and has a security patrol through the anchored boats at night.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/cuba-pics/cuba_cienfuegos_dinghy-beach/@@images/image/mini"/>A short walk from the marina is the place where everybody goes out in the evening and there is music playing here. In addition, right next to the marina and anchorage is the Cienfeugos Club which plays very loud music at night, making it difficult to sleep.</p>
<p>Take care to lift your dinghy out of the water at night and to ensure both it and the outboard are well locked.</p>
