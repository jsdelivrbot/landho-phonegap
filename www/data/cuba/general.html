<p>Plugs A &amp; B, C, F &amp; L.    <br/>Most older hotels 110 V.  Some newer hotels 220 V.  Some outlets are a combination of type A and C and can accept either type plug.</p>
<p><strong>LPG/Gas<br/></strong><span>Cooking gas in Cuba is Butane. The fittings are American style, so if your stove can burn propane it will also burn butane in most cases.</span></p>
<p><span><span></span><span>Butane can be obtained, but for foreigners it is a black market item because the cooking gas depots will </span></span><span><span><span>only sell gas to residents on a bottle exchange basis. Depending on your port there are usually some local entrepreneurs who will fill a 10lb bottle for around $10cuc. In Havana the same bottle can cost as much as $20cuc. If you have a </span><span>decanting hose you may be able to negotiate with a restaurant owner to sell you some of his supply.</span></span></span></p>
<p><b>Marine Supplies</b><br/><span>Marine supplies and parts are still non-existent, so cruisers must arrive in Cuba with all marine essentials.</span></p></div>

<div><p style="text-align: left; "><span><strong>Currency</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Cuba's dual-economy can take some getting used to. Two currencies circulate in Cuba: convertible pesos (CUC$) and Cuban pesos (CUP - also referred to as <em>moneda nacional</em>, abbreviated MN). The currency situation is made more confusing since Cubans will refer to both CUCs and CUP as <em>Pesos</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">There are approximately 25 CUP to 1 CUC.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">For the average Cuban it will be obvious which they are referring to, but this may lead to confusion for tourists who consider that they are bargaining in local currency only to find that their counter-party expects payment in CUCs!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">For most tourists CUP has little relevance since most, if not all of their expenditure will be in CUCs. This includes accommodation, food in most restaurants, taxis, bus tickets, nightclub entrances, tips and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Things which can be paid for in CUP include fruit and vegetables at the agricultural market, street food (such as pizza and peanuts) as well as local buses. Even at the agricultural market the prices are such that a pound of tomatoes may cost CUC 1 or 25 CUP (i.e. the same). There are some restaurants and bars/cafes, which charge in CUP although the quality is generally poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span>In October 2013 the government announced that it is going to scrap the two currency system - but it is expected that this will take some time to achieve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Exchange Rates</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><span> The exchange rate is tied to the US dollar and that is the only currency - which at the moment - incurs a 10% penalty for cash exchange (<span>so you will only receive 87 CUC for one USA dollar allowing for the 10% penalty and a 3% currency exchange fee). A better rate can be found using credit cards (see below).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><span><span><strong>Note: On March 17, 2016, the Cuban Government announced that it will eliminate this 10% tax on the US dollar.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><span><span></span></span></span><span>The best currencies to exchange in cash are Euros, Canadian Dollars, or Sterling since these are the most common and the exchange rates are generally quite reasonable. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span>Bear in mind that a stronger US Dollar means a stronger CUC (and hence less CUCs for your Euros/Sterling etc.). Other currencies, which are universally accepted include the Swiss Francs (CHF), Mexican Pesos (MXN) and Japanese Yen (JPY).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">There is no outright commission charged on transactions in cash although the exchange rate will generally be 3% worse than you would be charged on your credit card (for which you pay a 3% processing fee) so net you receive the same CUCs for changing 100 Euros in cash or 100 Euros on your credit card. For American Dollars, you will get a better exchange rate doing so by credit card as this does not incur the 10% penalty, only the 3% processing fee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Getting Money</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The easiest place to change money is at a CADECA (change bureau) or at a Cuban *BFI Bank. The exchange rates in all CADECAS and all banks are identical so there is no need to shop around. Hotels often have CADECAS within their premises. <span>ATMs work well but normally have some queues (it’s Cuba after all). Most of the marinas will also change money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><em>* There are 4 main banks in Cuba. BFI is the most reliable. You may be able to use other Cubans banks but these are less likely to be able to meet your needs since most operate mainly in Cuban Pesos. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Opening Hours</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span>Banks are open 7 days a week.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Note:</strong> There is a 25 CUC per person departure tax that has to be paid to leave Cuba, so put some CUC aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Credit Cards</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">Cash is king in Cuba. Except in major hotels you should not count on paying for goods or services with a credit card anywhere in Cuba.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><span>Lastly, if you leave a tip, leave it in CUC. Don't tip in CUP, it has very little value.</span></span></p>

<p><span>On July 1 2015, the Cuban government began rolling out expanded </span>Wi-Fi service <span>at 35 hotspots around the country and has lowered the price of connections from $4.50 an hour to $2. </span></p>
<p>Virtually all internet access is through ETECSA cards. These can be bought from hotel lobbies or ETECSA offices (where they are much cheaper) or off the street (normally for a 1CUC premium). <span>Make sure the plastic wrapping is on the card when you purchase it.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>A 1 hour <span>ETEKSA </span>card costs 2CUC. Once you have the card you log into the Wi-Fi with the password and user number on the card.</span></p>
<p>The best reception can often be found in hotel grounds, but ask around for good local hotspots. <span>Generally the connection is good but the hotspots get easily overloaded. As with everything else in Cuba, some waiting and persistence is required.</span></p>
<p><span>Worth noting is that hotels in Cuba are run on an all-inclusive basis, so if you buy a ticket for breakfast/lunch/dinner or for the day/evening, everything is free (including WiFi). </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>None of the hotels in Casilda however have working internet.</p>
