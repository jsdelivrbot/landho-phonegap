<div><p><strong>Pre-Arrival</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the latest details of the paperwork required by a US vessel to enter Cuba, see comments at the bottom of the page. Apply at least 4 weeks prior to your intended departure date.</strong></p>
<p>As soon as Cuban territorial waters are entered 12 miles off the Cuban coast a yacht must contact the port authorities or coastguard (Guarda Frontera) on VHF Channel 16 or HF 2128KHz. As most officials use hand held radios, you may not be able to do this until closer inshore.</p>
<p><span>Don't worry if you don't get an answer. If you have AIS on board it is likely the authorities will already be tracking you and will </span><span>try to contact you via VHF</span><span> and organise for officials to be there for your arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Cuba has only </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">eight ports of entry and your landfall must be at one of these designated ports. Under <span>no circumstances should one attempt to arrive unannounced or anchor in a bay.</span></span></p>
<p>The various authorities operate as follows:- <br/> HF(SSB) 2760KHz Red Costera Nacional (coastguard net) <br/> 2790KHz Red Turistica (tourist net)<br/> VHF Channel 68 port authorities <br/> Channel 19 tourist services.</p>
<p>In most ports the harbour master will answer in English. The following details should be communicated: name of yacht, flag, port of registry, last port of call, intended port of arrival in Cuba with approximate ETA, type of yacht and number of people on board. The captain will then be given instructions to proceed.</p>
<p>Channel 16 is also monitored by the marinas, however g<span>etting hold of someone at a marina can be difficult. </span></p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Clearance can only be obtained at ports which have a marina. The main port of entry for yachts is Hemingway Marina immediately to the west of Havana. All ports with marinas have tourist facilities and are used to clearing in yachts. The commercial port of Havana should not be entered as it has no provision for clearing yachts.</p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Cuba?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></strong> for the paperwork required for clearing-in.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>An exit zarpe from your last port is not necessarily required. Neither the USA or The Bahamas normally issue one.</p>
<p>Once moored in port, wait for the officials to arrive and no one must go ashore until clearance is completed. You may be asked to anchor out for clearance. How many officials come on board will depend on the port, anywhere between 2 and 12 and possibly a sniffer dog as well.</p>
<p>Clearance must first be obtained from Quarantine health officials, after which are the visits by Immigration, Customs, Agriculture department officials and Guarda Frontera (Coast Guard). These officials are based in the marina and clearance is usually completed promptly (2-3 hours), unless you have firearms aboard.</p>
<p>Officials are usually good natured and whilst there is substantial paperwork to complete it all adds up to the excitement of visiting this country, which for so long has been off limits. <span>Sometimes a small gift (such as a coke or pen) or a tip is requested. Y<span style="text-align: justify; ">ou are not obliged to tip, and in many ports a handout is frowned upon by the ranking official.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Cruising</strong></p>
<p>Once initial clearance is completed, a coastwise cruising permit (despacho de navegacion - costera) can be obtained from the Coast Guard (Guarda Frontera) on departure. Be sure to advise the harbour master that you intend to cruise Cuba so the Guarda can be prepared. No pre-planned list of ports is required, but the Guarda must be advised of your next stop.</p>
<p><strong>This permit currently allows you to cruise the waters of Cuba,<span style="text-align: justify; "> it does not allow you to go ashore, except at a designated marina.</span></strong></p>
<p>If any of the ports of entry mentioned above are entered, one has to go through the clearance procedure again. When cruising along the coast, one must report to the Guarda Frontera office in every port. All papers are usually inspected and the cruising permit is kept until departure.</p>
<p><span><strong>Officially yachts may only visit harbours and anchorages where there are marinas - except for the offshore cays.  No other anchorage or harbour may be visited and if it is, the captain and crew may not go ashore.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Departure</strong></span></p>
<p>Twenty-four hours' notice of departure should be given, if possible, even if sailing to another port in Cuba.</p>
<p>Before departure one must clear out with the Guarda Frontera at an official port of entry/exit. They will retain the despacho and issue a new exit despacho (clearance certificate) along with the cruising permit. One must also clear out with customs and immigration.</p>
<p>Foreign yachts (i.e. non-US boats) might find it advisable to leave Cuba for another country, such as the Bahamas, and make entry into the United States from there, as cruisers continue to report being denied a cruising permit for the US when trying to clear into Florida, having come directly from Cuba. Although, with the current, more friendly attitude, at Key West, this may no longer be a problem.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months beyond your planned stay.</p>
<p><span><span>Most nationals are issued with a Tourist Card/Visa on arrival which <span>will be issued by immigration as part of the clearing in process. Under the streamlined clearing in procedures simply give your passport/s to the Guar</span><span>da Officer who boards the boat and they will take care of the rest. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The initial visa is valid for 30 days and may be extended twice for a further 30 days each time (so a total of 90 days). The cost of the visa is $25 CUC as are the subsequent renewals. It is important to note that the cost of the visa is added to the marina bill, so no money should ever change hands. This is a standardized procedure everywhere in Cuba. If you are asked for cash, be sure to ask for an itemised signed receipt.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Canadians however will be issued with a Tourist Card for three months, renewable for three additional months.</span></p>
<p>Extensions can be arranged at the Cuban immigration offices, with a stamp that must be purchased at an international bank before going to the immigration office. This process is speeded up if some six copies of the crew list are prepared with all crew passport details. Cruising forums comment that <span>Key Largo is a good place to get your visa extended via the marina. Cienfuegos is reported to be difficult.</span></p>
<p>For longer stays it is advisable to arrive with a visa obtained in advance. Alternatively you must depart Cuba for another country and then return, starting the Immigration clock once more.</p>
<p><strong>Note - Passport Stamps</strong><br/>Some Latin American countries will not admit someone with a passport stamped in Cuba, but if asked, Cuban officials will not stamp passports.</p>
<p><span>Whilst officials at the airport sometimes stamp passports, the majority tend only to stamp the tourist card, which is inserted into your passport, and not the actual passport itself. The tourist card is</span><span> removed when you leave the country, so in this case there is never any evidence in your passport that you have been to Cuba.</span></p>
<p>For the time being it may be advisable for US citizens not to have their passport stamped in Cuba. The Cuban Interests Section and the Swiss embassy in Washington DC deal with visa applications.</p>
<p><span>If heading to the US after Cuba, foreign nationals can get a visa to enter the US at the American Interests Section in Havana before leaving there.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Crew joining/departing the boat in Cuba</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><i>Crew Joining<br/></i></strong>We are waiting for confirmation one one-way tickets and documents arriving crew should carry.</span></span></p>
<p><span>New crew flying into the country will need to get "enrolled" onto the boat via the authorities at the marina (approx. cost US$10).</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><i>Crew Departing</i></strong><br/>When you check into Cuba, inform the authorities at the marina that a crew member will be leaving the boat. They will need to be "disenrolled" from the boat (approx. cost US$10). </span></span></p>

<div><p><strong>Length of Stay</strong></p>
<p>As of November 21, 2013, visiting yachts can now stay up to 5 years in Cuba (previously the limit was 365 days), and even longer with the marina's approval. The boat, regardless where it is flagged, is permitted to stay in Cuba while the owners return home as long as the marina fees are paid in advance.</p>
<p>The <span>import tax on the value of the boat is no longer charged. </span></p>
<p><strong>Firearms</strong></p>
<p>If a yacht is staying a long time in one of the marinas, firearms will be impounded by the Coast Guard (Guarda Frontera). If the yacht is cruising along the coast, firearms must be declared every time the boat checks in at a new port and may be confiscated until departure or alternatively sealed on board, placed under the responsibility of the captain. The seals and arms will be inspected when clearing out.</p>
<p>Other items such as portable GPS, radios, flares and telephones may be sealed onboard by Customs until departure.</p>
<p>All plant, animal and meat products that are not canned must be declared to the health authorities on arrival. Fresh meat products may not be imported (however hard-frozen is probably ok). Reasonable quantities of canned meat, eggs, dairy or vegetable produce can be imported for the crew's own consumption.</p>
<p>Due to the increasing use of Cuba as a staging post for drugs, a sniffer dog may be used to search the boat on arrival.</p>

<div><p><span style="text-align: justify; "> In a medical emergency you will be likely taken to a tourist-only hospital which are reported to be good. Cuban doctors are highly regarded and are often some of the best trained in the entire Caribbean. (There's a joke among some cruisers that say, "If you get sick in the Caribbean, hope the doctor is Cuban.")</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Prescription drugs are not available in Cuba so be sure to have sufficient in supply. </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">Herbal tinctures and remedies are commonly used and are inexpensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Cuba is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></span></p></div>

<p><span>For U.S captains interested in taking their boats to Cuba with an OK from the U.S. Government, the place to start is here: </span><span><a class="external-link" href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/simplified-network-application-process-redesign-snap-r">https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/simplified-network-application-process-redesign-snap-r </a></span></p>
<p><span><a class="external-link" href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/simplified-network-application-process-redesign-snap-r"></a></span><span>That URL will lead you to the Department of Commerce’s SNAP-R (Simplified Network Application Program-Redesign), a simplified process for getting the paperwork you need for permission to go to Cuba. There are a lot of wickets to navigate, but applications are typically approved or turned down 3-4 weeks after a SNAP-R form is submitted to Commerce. This apparently replaces the old requirements for getting a license to visit Cuba, something that took months.</span></p>
<p><span>However, except for certain categories, most US citizens still need a <span>OFAC license to visit Cuba.
