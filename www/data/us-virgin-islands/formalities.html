<div><p>Yachts must clear in with Immigration when arriving from outside the Virgin Islands, with the exception of Puerto Rico. This includes the neighbouring British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>You must go directly to a port of entry for clearance. Passengers and crew of arriving yachts are not allowed to go ashore until properly cleared. All passengers must present themselves and their documents to US Customs and Border Protection. For clearance it is necessary to present documentation of nationality for each person on board as well as the ship's papers and clearance from the last port of call.</p>
<p>See this <a href="http://www.vicl.org/usvi-clearance-information.html"><b>US website</b></a> for the latest information.</p>
<p>If a yacht is going on to Puerto Rico it is advisable to obtain a cruising permit in St. Thomas, issued free (otherwise on arrival in Puerto Rico a fee is charged). All yachts must clear out with Customs before going to Puerto Rico, but not with Immigration.</p>
<p>There are serious penalties for not reporting arrival.</p>

<div><p>Immigration requirements are the same as for the US mainland. See Noonsite's <strong><a href="Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Immigration">USA/Immigration</a> </strong>page for details.</p>
<p>All nationalities arriving by private yacht need a valid US visa, which must be obtained in advance of arrival. Crew members must accompany the captain when clearing in as each individual must be seen and sign the entry permit. The USVI website (noted above) might give the impression that certain nationalities do not require a visa but NOTE, this only applies if arriving on a 'registered carrier'. A private yacht is not a registered carrier.</p>
<p>An alternative method of entry for crew without a prior visa is to make use of the Visa Waiver Program (if they are eligable) by first taking a ferry trip from the BVI's to the USVI's. This has been confirmed as perfectly legal and will then allow crew to enter the USVI again by yacht. It is, however, essential that they are in <span>possession of a valid ESTA <span> (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). Once granted, an ESTA is valid for 2 years. Entry under the VWP permits visits of up to 90 days <span>from the date of the first entry into US territory.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The US department of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  has implemented the Local Boater Option (LBO) program.

In order to participate in the LBO you must contact CBP at the nearest registration location designated by the port of entry.

<div><p class="p1">Hospitals and medical facilities are of a high quality in the USVI, particularly at St. Thomas. The US government oversees their operations and are held to the same standard as elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. The USVI including St.Thomas, St.Croix, and St.John are areas of interest for the CDC. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p>

<div><p>In their fight against drug traffic, the government of the US Virgin Islands has created a special strike force to patrol the waters of the US Virgins. Any yachts within territorial waters may be stopped, boarded and searched, and the presence of any illegal drugs on board can result in the yacht being confiscated.</p>
<p>A number of regulations have been established to protect the natural resources of the Virgin Islands National Park. The following are of direct interest to cruising sailors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not anchor on coral and avoid damaging the reef.</li>
<li>Anchoring is prohibited in Salt Pond, Reef Bay, Great and Little Lameshur Bays. Use the white mooring buoys, with a blue band, in these locations.</li>
<li>Do not take any live or dead marine features, such as coral, shells or fans.</li>
<li>Do not tie boats to shoreline vegetation.</li>
<li>Spearfishing is prohibited throughout the park. Line fishing is permitted, but there are certain restricted areas.</li>
<li>A maximum of two male spiny lobsters (minimum size 9 in/23 cm) may be taken, and only by hand or handheld snare.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mooring buoys have been installed for the use of cruising boats. Prohibited areas are marked by white cylinders with orange markings. For latest information view the National Park Service (NPS) website.</p>
<p>NPS has produced a Mooring Guideline brochure downloadable at<a href="http://www.nps.gov/viis/planyourvisit/upload/MooringGuide.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>http://www.nps.gov/viis/planyourvisit/upload/MooringGuide.pdf</b></a> which has Park regulations, mooring restrictions and island map.</p>
<p>NPS has created an interactive map for mariners that answers most common anchoring/mooring questions.

<p>National Park Service, Tel. (340)776-6201 for St. John and (340)773-1460 for St. Croix.</p>
<p>There are also public moorings (blue striped buoys) set up by the The Reef Ecology Foundation of St. Thomas and St. John. Use is free but restricted to boats less than 60'. Tel (340)775-0097 for more information.</p>
