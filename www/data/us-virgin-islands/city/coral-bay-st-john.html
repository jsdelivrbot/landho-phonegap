<div class="hello"><div><p>Coral Bay at the south east end of the island is choc-a-bloc with liveaboards and cruisers. Once the main community on the island because of its sheltered harbour, it has fallen from prominence with the introduction of a ferry service to Cruz Bay. Many tourists holidaying on St. John don't venture as far as Coral Bay.</p>
<p>The "Skinny Legs Bar" ashore and "Angel's Rest" afloat are the natural meeting spots for cruisers.</p>
<p>Whilst facilities and services are very limited here (after all, that is the attraction of the place), there are a few shops and a good - if expensive - deli.</p>
<p>Position 18° 20'26"N, 64° 42'38"W (bay entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It can get crowded in Coral Bay, therefore often it is better to anchor a bit further out to get swinging room, which is not always there in the mooring field. When anchoring it is advisable to keep well away from the north west shore as there are many sunken boats here, some visible, some not.  </p>
<p>Holding is good and the anchorage is reported to be calm. </p>
<p>Alan, at the head of the dinghy dock, has limited chandlery and will also rent you a mooring if you want. He is reported to be a good diesel mechanic as well. </p>
<p>The bus to Cruz Bay is quite reliable (US$1).</p>
