<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruz Bay is St. John's main town located on the west coast and the island's largest commercial center and port. Frequent barge and ferry, including car ferry, services connect St John to the neighboring more-developed island of St Thomas. Ferries also run regularly between Cruz Bay and Tortola, Virgin Gorda, and Jost Van Dyke in the BVIs.</p>
<p>The National Park Service has its headquarters near the waterfront in Cruz Bay as does U.S. Customs and Immigration. Cruz Bay also has a post office and bank.</p>
<p>Coral Bay, popular with cruising boats and liveaboards, is just 20 minutes away from Cruz Bay by car, at the SE end of the Island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring in Cruz Bay</strong></p>
<p>There is very limited anchoring space by the seaplane ramp in Cruz Bay.  The other anchoring areas have no room being full of fixed moorings. Bigger boats (draft 2m plus) will have to anchor well outside to clear in at the ferry terminal across from the National Park office.</p>
<p>For anchoring information around St John, see the<b> <a href="http://www.nps.gov/viis/planyourvisit/upload/anchoring_information_2009.jpg">National Park Map</a>.</b></p>
<p><strong>Moorings around St John</strong></p>
<p>There are restrictions on vessels travelling through and anchoring in National Park waters around St. John. Over 200 moorings have been laid around the island, to be used by visitors to the National Park. Moorings are safe, easy to use, and eliminate the need to anchor. Many of the National Park mooring centres have floating pay stations making life easier - just look out for the rafts with the National Park flag flying. Moorings cost $15 a night from 5.00pm to 7.30am.</p>
<p>Find more information at <b><a href="http://www.nps.gov/viis/planyourvisit/upload/MooringGuide.pdf">Using the National Park Mooring System</a>.</b></p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://reefecologyfoundation.org/"><b>The Reef Ecology Foundation of St. Thomas and St. John</b></a> have set up 45 moorings for public use. These are easy-to-see, blue striped buoys. Use is free but restricted to boats under 60' long for day use only with a three hour limit. The sites include; Thatch Cay, Grass Cay, Congo Cay, Carvel Rock, Great St. James, Little St. James, Cow and Calf, Capella Island, Flat Cay and Saba Island. Moorings are often under repair so see the <a href="http://reefecologyfoundation.org/page436127.htm"><b>Foundation's website</b></a> for details on the state of all moorings.</p>
