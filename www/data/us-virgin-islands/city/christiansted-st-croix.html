<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several small docks owned by Jones Maritime in the downtown area. St Croix Marine is just to the east in Gallows Bay, and there are also mooring buoys here (although it can be very rolly). Further east is Green Cay Marina.</p>
<p><span>Anchoring can be tricky because the best places, near The Boardwalk and Angry Nate's (popular cruiser hangouts) are occupied with private mooring balls. </span></p>
<p>Dinghies may be docked in front of Styxx Restaurant. St. Croix Marine also has a dinghy dock, which is walking distance to the Customs Office at the commercial dock.</p>
<p>There are restrictions on both travelling through, and anchoring around St Croix. Contact the National Parks Service for more information.</p>
<p>Moorings have been laid by the Reef Ecology Foundation (easy-to-see blue striped buoys) in the following locations:- Long Reef, Salt River, Cane Bay, Davis Bay and Annaly Bay. Their use is free but restricted to boats under 60' long.</p>
