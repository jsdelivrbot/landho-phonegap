            </h2>
<div><p>To clear in you MUST currently go to the commercial dock at Oranjestad NOT Barcadera Harbour. This is<strong> </strong>“Yellow marked” area (H Pier). It is next to the <span>Renaissance </span>marina.</p>
<p><span>On approach, call “Aruba Port Control” on VHF channel 16 (or 11). The port Captain will switch to channel 11 or 14. Then request permission to enter the harbour to clear Customs and Immigration. Everyone must remain on board until clearance is completed. The officials will come to the boat.</span></p>
<p>See the comments from cruisers at the bottom of the page on the difficulties with mooring at the Oranjestad commercial dock. Also see the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Aruba/Oranjestad/">Oranjestad</a></strong> page for tips and best advice. The good news is that Aruba Port Control have listened to cruisers' complaints and have promised to improve the berthing arrangement here for visiting yachts undertaking clearance.</p>
<p><span>Fly the 'Q' flag once in Aruban waters until clearance is completed.</span></p>
<p><span>The correct courtesy flag is that of the Netherlands, but a request can be made for an Aruban flag. On departure, be sure to obtain clearance out of Aruba.</span></p>
<p><span>If visiting during the cruise ship season (October - April) planning clearance, either in or out, in the afternoon is likely to result in a short waiting time for the officials to visit.</span></p>
<p>In the main, cruisers report that of<span> all the Dutch Antilles on the south side of the Caribbean, Aruba is the least yacht friendly of them all.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Visa requirements: </strong><br/></span>Even though Aruba is now an autonomous country of the Kingdon of the Netherlands, its own visas rules apply.</p>
<p>Citizens of the USA, Canada, U.K. , Ireland and a Schengen Area country do not require a visa. .</p>
<p>Other nationalities should download entry requirements from <a href="http://www.aruba.com/sigma/Entry_Req-Eng.pdf"><strong>http://www.aruba.com/sigma/Entry_Req-Eng.pdf</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The initial period of time that a person can be admitted to Aruba as a tourist is 30 days, however, a longer period can be requested on entry.  The total amount of days a person can stay in Aruba, as a tourist cannot exceed 180 days per year. For a list of nationalities who can extend their 30 day stay for up to 180 days, go to the above link.</p>
<p>If you plan to stay longer than 30 days, ask for an extension on entry.</p>

<p>If a yacht stays for less than 180 days, a Temporary Import Permit (TIP) <strong>is</strong> <strong>required</strong>. In this case, no deposit is required.</p>
<p><span>Any time a yacht is stored in an official Customs Storage facility (i.e. the one at </span><span>Varadero Caribe) is not included in the 180 days.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that as this rule is new, not all Customs officials are familiar with it.</span></p>
<p><span>If a yacht stays longer than 180 days, a Temporary Import Permit will need to be obtained together with payment of a deposit (or a bank guarantee) for the value of the duties for the yacht.</span></p>
<p><span>At the expiration of the TIP the yacht will have to leave the island for at least 15 days before a new temporary permit can be applied for.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>If the yacht stays longer than a year the yacht will have to be imported.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Yachts brought into Aruba with the intention of sale will have to pay duties upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span>Varadero Caribe now has Customs Storage status where the time  a yacht is left on the hard is not included in the 180 day restriction.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Aruba is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</p>
