<div class="hello"><div><p><span>To clear in you MUST currently go to the commercial dock at Oranjestad NOT Barcadera Harbour. This is the</span><strong> </strong><span>“Yellow marked” area (H Pier). It is next to the </span><span>Renaissance </span><span>marina.</span></p>
<p>For full details of clearing in here, refer to the main <a href="Countries/Aruba?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Aruba Formalities</strong></a> page for detailed information on Clearance, Customs and Immigration Rules.</p>
<p>Various cruisers have commented on the terrible state of the commercial dock in Oranjestad, alongside which yachts have to tie in order to clear in <span> (officials need to be able to board and inspect the boat if required)</span>. Be prepared. The dock is concrete with filthy rubber tyres that will mark your boat and limited bollards. <span>You will not be given any help to tie alongside, and the wind and currents will make it a difficult procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>Best advice on how to deal with this 'dock' is to try <span> and raft up with a fishing or commercial boat and walk across their boat. Alternatively, if you can, try </span>and arrive in settled weather and have a fender board in place before approaching the 'dock' and long lines. Loop the bollards when close enough and tighten the looped lines back on your deck cleat.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The good news is that Aruba Port Control have listened to cruisers' complaints and have promised to improve the berthing arrangement here for visiting yachts undertaking clearance.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Call the harbour authority before entering this port. There is a lot of cruise ship activity here.</p>
<p>Besides the marina, which is convenient for the town,  there are two yacht clubs where visitors may sometimes use the moorings.</p>
<p>Down the coast from Oranjestad, near Spanish Lagoon, is the Aruba Nautical Club, which has berths, fuel, water and electricity. Members of other yacht clubs may use the facilities, but should check in advance.</p>
<p>Between Oranjestad and Spanish Lagoon, just south of the airport, is the Bucuti Yacht Club which also has docking space and may have room for a visiting yacht.</p>
<p>Varadero Caribe right next to (NE of) BYCA, will accept visitors, but is usually full. There is a restaurant on premises and also a travel lift.</p>
<p>The anchorage just south of the port, known as the Airport Anchorage, has good holding in 7 to 9ft if you ensure you are dug into sand. It is a short walk into the town.</p>
<p>The anchorage in the <span>Bucuti Lagoon is the most protected one. It is fairly shallow but the holding is good in about 7ft (2m).</span></p>
