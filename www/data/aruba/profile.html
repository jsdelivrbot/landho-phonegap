<div><ul>
<li>Aruba together with <b><a class="external-link" href="Bonaire"> Bonaire</a></b> and <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Curacao">Curacao</a></b> form the ABC islands. They are the three western-most islands of the Leeward Antilles in the Caribbean and Aruba is the westernmost of the ABCs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aruba lies just 18 miles off the coast of Venezuela. The island is 20 miles at its longest and 6 miles at its widest. The southern, leeward side of the island has long stretches of white sand beaches, while the northern coast has a more rugged and dramatic landscape.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aruba is a flat island, exposed to the ocean currents. Bonaire and Curaçao are surrounded by reefs, and so are much more sheltered from the weather. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aruba is an autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The island has the same status as the Netherlands Antilles.</li>
<li>The official language is Dutch, but English and Spanish as well as a local dialect called Papiamento are spoken.</li>
<li>The island is a convenient last stop for yachts heading for Panama.</li>
<li>The new Renaissance Marina in Oranjestad has improved the previously poor yachting facilities, however note that yachts must first clear at Barcadera harbour.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>
