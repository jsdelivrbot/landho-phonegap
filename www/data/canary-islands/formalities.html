            </h2>
<div><p>As part of Spain, the Canaries are members of the EU, with which they have a special relationship. The islands have remained outside the EU VAT area, although there is a low local tax on sales and services. The usual EU regulations apply, although because of their isolated position, the authorities tend to treat all arriving yachts as if coming from a non-EU country.</p>
<p>All boats should report immediately to the Port Authority or marina on arrival and formalities can now be completed at the major port on any of the seven islands.</p>
<p>The Port Captain or marina office who will advise on the correct procedure and, in the case of the marinas, will contact the relevant authorities. The Canaries are a duty-free area, so yachts are not expected to clear customs.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on yacht movements in the Canaries, although papers may be checked at subsequent ports.</p>
<p>It is advisable to obtain Clearance when leaving the Canaries as this is often required by officals in other countries. However, in Las Palmas it is almost impossible to obtain such papers.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Passports must be valid for 3 months beyond the intended stay.</p>
<p>Visa exemptions and requirements are as for <a href="Countries/Spain?rc=Formalities#Immigration"><strong>Spain</strong></a>; however, this does not appear to be applied strictly to yachts, provided the person also leaves the islands by yacht.</p>
<p>The Canary Islands are part of the Schengen Agreement Area.</p>
<p>Passports of crew are not normally stamped on arrival, but if crew members wish to leave by air, it is essential to get their passports stamped, as otherwise they might be turned back from the airport.</p>
<p>Visas are not required for nationals of the EU, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland regardless of the length of stay.</p>
<p>Visas are not required for nationals of other West European countries, Canada and the United States, as well as Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Singapore, Uruguay and Venezuela for stays of up to 90 days in any 180 day period.</p>
<p>Children under 14 of any nationality do not require visas if they have their own passports.</p>
<p>Visas are required for all other nationals or for stays longer than 90 days, to be obtained in advance from a Spanish embassy or consulate abroad. If obtained locally, proof of medical insurance and adequate funds will be required.</p>
<p>National of the following countries will need to apply for a visa <strong>in person</strong>:- Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Burundi, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran , Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, N. Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Qatar, Tunisia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Often the immigration official does not stamp passports of people entering on yachts, but if planning to leave Spain by another means of transport, an entry stamp (entrada) will be needed.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>There are no customs formalities on arrival, nor are there restrictions on firearms.</p>
<p>However, Customs are concerned about drug trafficking, especially from North Africa, and although they appear to be easy-going, they do keep a close eye on yacht movement.</p>
<p>It is possible to lay up a boat in which case the authorities must be informed and the boat is sealed. Duty is not then liable.</p>
<p>Although the Islands are in the EU, they are outside the EU Customs territory, so VAT is not applied here. Instead, there is a specific Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 5%. This tax is payable on non-EU boats which remain in use, in the country for more than 18 months.</p>
<p>British cruisers who recently imported their boat into Spain (in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) with the new improved Spanish system, reported the process to be simple. All paperwork is done at Trafico and 12% of the purchase cost (not current value) of the boat needs to be paid.</p>
<p><b>Importing Spares</b></p>
<p><span>Importing spares can unfortunately still be very complicated due to the Canaries’ status as an outermost region, outside the EU VAT area. It is recommended to use an agent if bringing in items of value, since this way the item can both be sent as cargo from airport to airport (each of the islands has at least one!) and arrangements can also be made for the item to be imported to the boat as a vessel in transit, thus avoiding importation taxes. </span></p>
<p><span>Courier companies (DHL, Fedex, UPS and TNT) can be rather difficult to work with as they either have in-house customs departments or send off packages to third parties, upon which point, especially recently in the case of Fedex, they can be very difficult to trace. If this route cannot be avoided, be sure to add a contact telephone number on the packaging to avoid the package being held in limbo.</span></p>

<p><strong>Tasa de ayuda a la navegacion (Navigational assistance rates or the "lighthouse tax")</strong></p>
<p>Light dues, payable throughout Spain (and the Canary Islands), were revised for 2015. This tax is now charged as a daily rate to transient foreign yachts.</p>
<p><span>Tasa de ayuda a la navegación (T-0): m ² x 0.025 x day. (Sail ≥ 12 m)</span></p>

<p><span>Tasa de embarcaciones deportivas y de recreo (Berthing) (T-5): 0,145 x m² x day.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Total Daily Rate to pay</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>Multiply length (meters) by beam (meters), and result in square meters multiplied by 0.17€ (0.145€ + 0.025€), and the daily rate is obtained (included IGIC local tax).</span></span></p>
