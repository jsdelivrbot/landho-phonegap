<div class="hello"><div><p><span>La Restinga port is located on the southern tip of El Hierro.</span></p>
<p>The south coast of El Hierro, west of La Restinga, has been declared a nature reserve. Anchoring and diving is now prohibited in this protected area.</p>
<p><span>This port is open to visiting yachts. </span><span>Scientists now believe that the underwater volcano can not cause any harm as the magama reservoir is not great enough to break through.</span></p>
<p>Position 27° 38'16"N,17° 58'57"W (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Although the addition of a western breakwater in the fishing harbour  has improved the protection, there is still a constant surge in the marina/harbour.</p>
<p>The marina here suffered storm damage pre-2010, however latest reports are that this is a friendly little harbour with pontoons and you can find provisions and restaurants on shore. Many of the fishing boats left following the volcanic activity in 2011, so there is reported to be plenty of space.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts may also come alongside the harbour wall, which has large vertical hard rubber fenders suitable for fishing boats (reported to be too far apart to use a fender board). It is recommended a breast anchor is laid to haul the boat off the wall. Although the quay is high there are step ladders leading right down to the water.</p>
<p>There is no safe anchorage here for yachts.</p>
<p>A port official will normally come to the boat.</p>
<p>There is a small hotel by the port (Kai Marine) where sailors are allowed to use the showers (3 euros). There is fuel, water, a travel hoist and hard standing also available.</p>
