<div class="hello"><div><p>Rarely any moorings for visiting boats. </p>
<p>Visitors must anchor outside and take stern lines to the inner breakwater, or anchor in the well-protected area between the harbour and the beach. The holding here seems to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Skippers are advised to enquire if there is space before they arrive, otherwise visiting yachts berth at the main wharf until a place is found for them. </p>
<p>There are a few moorings for yachts to come stern-to the outer breakwater which is fronted by large rocks.</p>
