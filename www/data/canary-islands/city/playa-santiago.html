<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts are normally directed to come alongside the main quay, past the large fenders marking the area used by the regular jetfoil. There is some space to come alongside on the inner quay by the travelift pen.</p>
<p>If all places are taken, you may be asked to anchor in the bay. The mooring buoys in the harbour are for the use of local boats. The holding is not very good on a sandy bottom.</p>
<p>In strong east and southeast winds surge is a problem and if berthed alongside the quay, hold off with the help of an anchor.</p>
<p><span>The port office is in a low building outside the gates. </span></p>
<p><span>There is an ATM outlet at Caja Canarias in the main square.</span></p></div></div>
