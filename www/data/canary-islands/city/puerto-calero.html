<p>Puerto Calero is <span>situated just SW of </span>Puerto del Carmen<span> on Lanzarote's south east coast.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>A preferred base in the Canaries for leaving boats unattended, standards are high and the </span><span>marina is well-kept and maintained. Despite many restaurants and a fully-equipped yard, the </span><span>area is quiet and relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span>The airport is 15 minutes drive from the marina and car-hire, taxis, bike-hire and a bus stop can all be found on site. There is a market on twice a week and Endeavour Sailing, the local RYA centre, offers many courses for cruisers.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Discounts are offered for sailing visitors in Cabrera Medina car hire; the well-equipped Mc2 </span><span>Action gym and Amura restaurant. Mention “Noonsite” for a 10% discount off short stay </span><span>berthing.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Position 28º 54'55"N, 13º 42'25"W.</span></span></p></div></div>

<p>Security is very good and this is a good place to leave a yacht unattended.</p>
