<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The port monitors VHF channel 12 at all times, and uses channel 6 as a working channel. <span>Outside of office hours, there is a watchman patrolling the marina with a VHF radio tuned to channel 6.</span></span></p>
<p>Arriving boats should come alongside the reception dock on the starboard side at the entrance to the marina. Many of the moorings on the pontoons are privately owned, but the 190m  long outer wharf is reserved for visitors. The marina has a capacity of just over 200 berths, of which 50% are available to visitors in summer and 20% in winter, the busier season.</p>
<p>As Mogan is a popular port among transatlantic voyagers, those who wish to leave their boats here should reserve a place well in advance, especially during the busy season from the end of October to February.</p>
<p>All pontoon berths have water and electricity, also telephone connections and even a television and video link. There are showers and toilets on the outer quay reserved for visitors, for which a key must be obtained from the marina office. There are also showers and toilets on the ground floor of the control tower. A weather synopsis is posted every day on the notice board outside the marina office.</p>
<p>Mogan operates its own inshore rescue service, the only such service on Gran Canaria's south coast, and has two large inflatable boats.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage east of the marina entrance which is occasionally used by cruising boats for short periods.</p></div></div>

      One of the most attractive marinas in the Canaries and is the furthest south on Gran Canaria.  Puerto Mogan is often full to capacity so reservations are essential. Haulout facilities available.
