<div class="hello"><div><p>The distictive shape of Montana Amarilla (Yellow Mountain) marks the western limit of the large bay. This is a tourist resort close to the southern tip of Tenerife where a range of sporting activities are available.</p>
<p>This port is very convenient for the Tenerife Sur (Reina Sofia) airport with cheap charter-flight connections to Spain, UK, France, Germany and Holland. So a good place to leave your boat for a trip home however a hire car would be needed to do major reprovisioning.</p>
<p>Position 28°0.1'N, 16°37'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is now a useful marina here. Access from the sea is easy, and the marina is reported to be fairly well protected in most conditions although the wind is often abeam when manoevering into the tight berths.</p>
<p>A line of yellow buoys to port as you enter mark a shallow area with rocks best avoided, particulary at low tides. Wait to be directed to a free berth if one is not visible and the reception pontoon is ful.</p>
<p><span>Staff are reported to be helpful and speak English.</span></p>
