<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/LasPalmasMarina.GrahamVantHoff.JPG/@@images/image/mini"/>Puerto de la Luz y Las Palmas, to give its official name, is a busy commercial port. It lies on the NE corner of the island.</p>
<p>This is the home of the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC) which departs from Las Palmas for St. Lucia in the Caribbean every November. See<b> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/CanaryIslands/LasPalmasdeGranCanaria/?rc=PortProfile#Docking">Docking</a></b> for further information.</p>
<p>New boatyard facilities opened here at the end of 2012 run by Rolnautic (chandlery). See<strong> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/CanaryIslands/LasPalmasdeGranCanaria/?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyards</a> </strong>for further information.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The movement of all vessels is monitored from a control tower in the Port Authority building. If in any doubt one should contact Port Control on channel 16 or 10, who will then advise to switch to a working channel. Yachts entering or leaving should look out for commercial traffic, particularly the fast ferries.</p>
<p>The yacht harbour, Muelle Deportivo, lies at the southern end of the main harbour. It is administered by the Port Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Entrance:</strong> the entrance into the marina is hard to detect and the situation is made more confusing by the entrance being marked by two red flashing lights, the one to be left to starboard being located at the eastern end of the northern breakewater, the other (port side) at the northern end of the main (southern) breakwater. Vessels should favour the starboard side of the narrow entrance as the port side is fouled and shallow.</p>
<p>All arriving yachts should go the new marina reception berth where a port official will meet them and assign a berth. (Reception Pontoon on your port side - do not go to a pontoon unless instructed to do so by a port official). At night tie up alongside reception pontoon or anchor just north of marina entrance</p>
<p>Formalities are completed in the port office in a new building at the entrance to the marina, next to the CEPSA fuel station.</p>
<p>The captain should report during office hours (0700 -1400 daily) with the ship's papers and passports. No other formalities are normally necessary for EU boats having only EU nationals on board.</p>
<p>Crew members who are leaving the Canaries by air must take their passports to the Immigration office (Policia de Frontera, Tel 0034 928 264 431) located at the eastern end of the main Port Authority building (Edificio Autoridad Portuaria) in the port compound. This can be reached by taxi or bus no.1.</p>
<p>All boat movements are monitored by radar and video surveillance from Port Authority control tower</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p><span>Yachts are allowed to anchor here for 24 hours, whatever time they arrive they have 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The beach next to the anchorage is a recreational beach and so the authorities want to keep it clear for recreation, and yachts to berth in the marina where there is space. </span><strong>No anchoring is permitted in the bay between March 15 till Sept 15. </strong>Yachts are given 24 hours to leave or enter the marina, where there will always be some space available. The one exception is prior to the ARC rally in November when all yachts that do not have a long-term contract will be requested to leave the marina.</p>
<p>Outside these months, it is possible to anchor north of the marina. Many yachts anchor with stern lines to the marina breakwater. <span>This anchorage gets very busy in October/November with over 60 yachts at anchor trying to avoid each other.The port makes a small charge for this anchorage. The T-0 tax is also applied if you just anchor outside the marina.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Information</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="Countries/CanaryIslands/gran-canaria_las-palmas_muelle-deportivo-map-2015/"><strong>this map</strong></a> for the marina layout.</p>
<p>The reception dock is located on the port side immediately past the marina entrance. The marina office is also located here. The Texaco fuel dock is just beyond the reception dock further into the marina on the port side.</p>
<p>A floating pontoon along the main quay makes docking easier. Larger yachts normally come stern-to the main quay after picking up a mooring buoy or dropping their own anchor.</p>
<p>Yachts under 18 metres tie up to one of visitors' pontoons along the northern breakwater.  There is water and electricity to all berths.</p>
<p>There are shower blocks close to all pontoons; magnetic cards for these and the pontoon gates can be obtained from the port office for a small deposit <span>(€10 in October 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>For stays longer than a month there is a discount, if port fees are paid in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Berthing in October/November and the ARC</strong><br/> <!--added oct11 following complaints. Nick (ARC organiser) got us the info.--></p>
<p>The marina has informed Noonsite that during October until the first week of November, yachts in transit are allowed to stay in the marina for 3-5 days (space permitting). Longer stays are not permitted as the marina can not risk yachts being left in the marina and the owners vacating their boats (which has happened in the past). All available marina space is needed in the last 3 weeks of November for the ARC. Permanent berth holders (more than 6 months) do not have to leave the marina.<br/> <i>Note however that yachts requesting berthing in advance by e-mail ihave been refused, although turning up on spec. may result in a few days being given.</i></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A magnetic card system for the pontoon gates/showers has been installed and is now fully functioning; yachts are only given access to their own pontoons<span>. </span>A comprehensive <span>CCTV </span>system is in operation, as well as regular patrols by the Port Police.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that this is a public marina and non-sailors are frequently around the pontoons, <span>although the new magnetic card system has helped restrict access. </span>There have been reports of burglaries at night while crew are sleeping and therefore it is best to adopt the policy of locking your front door at night and not leaving anything of value visible on deck or in the cockpit.</p>
<p><strong>Rubbish/Garbage and Recycling </strong></p>
<p>Most items can be recycled in Gran Canaria, and there are containers positioned around the marina: Yellow containers are for milk cartons, aluminium cans, tetrapak, etc.; Blue/grey containers are for cardboard &amp; paper; Gas bottle and oil recycling containers are situated near the Texaco fuel dock <span>and there is an oil recycling facility (for oils and used contaminated containers) next to the boatyard in the northern part of the marina. </span>Some glass bottle containers are also in the marina. All other refuse should be securely tied in plastic bags and placed in the dark green containers near every pontoon.</p>
