<div class="hello"><div><p>A busy ferry port at the northern extremity of Fuerteventura, popular with tourists and known for its excellent windsurfing and kitesurfing.</p>
<p>The approach to Corralejo calls for care as there are various outlying dangers. Reefs to the north and north west of the harbour entrance. Car ferries entering or leaving the ferry dock are not easily visible (at night the ferry dock is lit by bright floodlights).</p>
<p>Position 28°44'23"N, 13<span>°</span> 51'52"W (marina)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are four pontoons: the visitors pontoon is long, the first one you come to on entering (i.e. the outer pontoon); the one running parallel to the quay is reserved for excursion boats.</p>
<p><span>The visitor berths are finger berths on the outer pontoon and there are only six, so space is at a premium. Yachts can moor bow or stern-to the main pontoon with the finger pontoon alongside. The finger pontoons are a bit short and lacking in cleats so clever tying up is required. There can be a swell here in southerlies so be sure to use springs.</span></p>
<p>Arriving yachts should anchor or come to the visitors pontoon if there is space. The skipper should then go ashore and contact the port official to arrange berthing. The office is on the main quay by the ferry terminal. Be sure to check how long you are permitted to stay. There have been reports that only 3 days is permitted here (see comment at bottom of page).</p>
<p>Water and electrics are good and there is regular security at night, however no shoreside bathrooms. Very good pricing.</p>
<p>Larger yachts should come alongside the E. quay or the ferry terminal, but this must be prearranged with the port official.</p>
<p>Space for anchoring is limited by rocky shallows near the beach and ferries need room for manoeuvre.</p>
