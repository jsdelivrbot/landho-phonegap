<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts can use either the marina or the protected small fishing harbour to the north of the church. </p>
<p>The harbour opens to the south and the narrow entrance should be entered with care as the harbour is small, crowded with moorings and manoeuvering is difficult. Go alongside the outer wall or, if there is no space, alongside one of the larger fishing boats, although one must be prepared for a lot of movement both day and night in this crowded harbour. </p>
<p>Visitors are usually ignored by the authorities and docking fees are rarely collected.</p>
<p>With the completion of the new fishing harbour it is expected that there will be more space available in the old harbour.</p>
