<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto del Rosario is more suited for commercial shipping or fishing vessels and yachts are better served by the small marina at Caleta de Fustes, a few miles further south.</p>
<p>There is water on the fishing quay and electricity on the pontoons, but otherwise the port has limited facilities for yachts. Short stays may be accommodated <span style="text-align: justify; ">inside the south western mole.</span></p>
<p>The entrance is clear of any dangers. Steer towards the eastern breakwater and once past its end, make for the smaller southern wharf.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor SW of the cruise ship terminal. The holding is sand and rock.</p>
