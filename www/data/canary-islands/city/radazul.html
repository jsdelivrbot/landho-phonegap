<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is narrow, and yachts must proceed around the western end of the outer breakwater. It is not advisable to enter in rough weather, although once inside, the marina is well-protected.</p>
<p>The marina is very quiet on weekdays and security is very good. Because of its isolation, the marina is provided with everything essential, which includes a pharmacy and even a chapel.</p>
<p>Charges include the use of water and electricity, which are at each pontoon and also on the main dock. There are large discounts if the docking is paid in advance for longer stays. Long term storage space is also available on the main quay.</p>
