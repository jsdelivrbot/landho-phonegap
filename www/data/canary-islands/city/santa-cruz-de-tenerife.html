<div class="hello"><div><p>Santa Cruz de Tenerife is a busy ferry and cruise ship port on the southern coast at the eastern end of the island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Any vessel approaching to Santa Cruz de Tenerife’s Port must contact “Tenerife Traffic” control on radio channels 16 or 74 at 12 miles or 1 hour before arriving. The control centre will then ask  for information about the ship and advise to switch to VHF working channel12, and maintain in permanent listening on VHF channels 16/74.</span></p>
<p><span>All vessels must keep a listening watch on VHF channel 12 when sailing up to 3 miles to/from port entrance. Vessels sailing inside port waters shall not exceed 7 knots speed, shall sail using their motor (when available) and keeping the port entrance as clear as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Entrance: Before entering or leaving the Marina, vessels must report to the Control Centre. Vessels must enter or leave using the assigned channels by Port Authority, and in any case, as close as possible to the coast, avoiding crossing other entry and exit channels. Entry and exit to the marina should as close as possible to the green light in the outer dike. The entry channel for Marina Tenerife (at fishing dock) is 100m wide and 2500m long, the entrance is facing SW, has a width of 65m and has a minimum depth of 9m.</span></p>
<p><span>Arriving yachts should wait for an assigned berth. Do not go to a pontoon unless instructed to do so by a port official.</span></p>
<p><span>On arrival, the skipper must report to the Port Authority or marina office who will advise on procedures. Marinas will contact the relevant authorities on their behalf. After having checked in, skipper can cruise around Canary Islands with no restrictions, however, documents may be checked at subsequent ports. As the Canaries are duty-free, yachts are not required to clear customs.</span></p>
<p><span>Crew members who are leaving the Canaries by air must take their passports to the immigration office (ask in marina office for directions) to have their passports stamped on entry.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts berth at either Marina Santa Cruz (also known as Marina del Atlantico) in  the centre of Santa Cruz or Marina Tenerife in the fishing harbour (Darsena  Pesquera) some three miles north of the city or, if a berth is available, at Marina Radzul about 5 miles south of the city..</p>
<p><strong>Marina Santa Cruz</strong> is entered via the southern entrance into Muelle de Los  Llanos, which is the southernmost basin facing Tenerife's capital. It is located  right in the centre of the city and is protected by a detached mole separating  the marina from the rest of the commercial basin. Docking facilities are good  and there is space available for visitors, as well as a travel lift for hauling out. The marina is increasing the number of berths.</p>
<p>Note that the only way out of the port on foot is at either end - about 1/2 mile  to the East and 3 miles to the West. All taxis have to leave by the West road,  so the taxi fare to Plaza de Espana (city centre) is approx. 5€ even though it  is just across the road from the port.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that this marina is charging high Light Dues, reported to be over 100% of the berthing fees. The marina has been contacted to confirm this, we are still waiting for a reply.</p>
<p><strong>Marina Tenerife</strong> is in the former fishing harbour (Darsena Pesquera) in  the northern part of the port. Permanent watch is kept on VHF channel 9 and an  attendant will direct the yacht to a vacant slip. During the high season  (September to December) it is advisable to reserve in advance. This is the only  marina with a fuel dock for yachts.</p>
<p>It is also possible to berth on the northernmost quay of the fishing harbour,  which is administered by the Port Authority; a few yachts prefer this low-cost  option, despite the lack of  facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Without special permission from the Port Captain, there is no anchoring in Bahía  de <span>Antequera</span> for yachts flying a foreign flag.</p>

      240 side berth slips. Normally well protected, but a southerly wind can cause an uncomfortable swell. Water, electricity,  travel lift and some repair services. Marina now has WiFi by the office. Currently does not work on the docks. Fees reported to be considerably higher than elsewhere in the Canaries due to charging of an extra port tax other Spanish ports do not seem to implement. Personnel not English speaking but reported to be very friendly. No fuel dock, but marina will organise a free delivery by small tanker from the nearby Texaco station, at short notice. Chandlery facilities are available a walk away.<br>
