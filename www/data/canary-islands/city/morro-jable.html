<div class="hello"><div><p>A<i> </i>marina has now been created here in Morro Jable.</p>
<p>When approaching from the east, yachts first pass the long sandy beaches, then hotels and apartment buildings to the east, and finally the massive breakwater comes into view.</p>
<p>When approaching from the west, Punta Jandia should be given a wide berth to avoid some shallow patches.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in the harbour just to the west of the boatyard, but beware of the foul ground.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage west of the harbour from the bay to just east of the lighthouse. The holding is good in a sand but put out plenty of chain as the wind gusts can be very strong.</p>
