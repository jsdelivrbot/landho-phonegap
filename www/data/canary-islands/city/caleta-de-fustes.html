<div class="hello"><div><p>Entrance to the marina can be difficult for those unfamilair with the outlying dangers. Reefs extend half a mile offshore, both from the harbour wall and the southern shore of the bay.</p>
<p>Navigation buoys mark the southern extremity of the offshore reef and also the eastern extremity of the shallow ground to the west of the port entrance.</p>
<p>Night entrance should be avoided.</p>
<p>To be safe, yachts coming from the north should keep between half and one mile offshore and sail well south of the marina entrance before turning to enter. The marina advises that a course of 355deg should be sailed in the final approaches.</p>
<p>The marina monitors VHF channels 9 and 16 between office hours (09:00-20:00) and will give advice on the approaches if requested.</p>
<p>There is one main floating pontoon with fingers as well as a pontoon alongside the quay.</p>
<p>Yachts larger than 16 metres should reserve a slip in advance. If no prior arrangements made, tie up at the fuel dock on the main quay until a berth can be arranged.</p></div></div>
