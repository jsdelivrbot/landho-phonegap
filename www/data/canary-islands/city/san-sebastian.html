<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care as you are likely to experience very strong winds as you approach the Island. Entering the harbour at San Sebastian, keep to the port side and motor between the yellow buoys parallel to the beach. This is to leave space for the ferries to enter and depart from the dock. This channel is not obvious when entering the harbour.</p>
<p>Boats can be hauled out at Playa Santiago. A small workshop, AYS, has opened in the marina run by a German called Andy. See boatyards for more information.</p>
<p>Marina exposed to the SW and can be uncomfortable in gales.</p>

      This is a well sheltered marina right in the centre of San Sebastian. It does not take bookings. The marina office, showers and toilets are at the western end of the marina.<br>
All slips have water and electricity and free Wi-Fi (although a good Wi-Fi antenna is needed). Most pontoons have key cards and there is a security guard on watch at night. New Taxes for visiting yachts have been introduced 2010 (see report adjacent).
