<div class="hello"><div><p>It is permissable to take the ferry over to Lanzarote to arrange clearance.</p>
<p>Isla de Alegranza to the north is now a nature reserve and you need a permit to visit. A permit is also required to anchor in most of the bays on Graciosa.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>If possible, ask the marina/harbour authorities of your previous port to call ahead before you visit La Graciosa and organise berthing in the port, or permission to anchor. You may be turned away if you arrive unannounced. </span></p>
<p><span>The harbour has been extended with plans to make a marina (of sorts). There are pontoons for visiting yachts both on the SW side of the port and parallel to the eastern breakwater. </span></p>
<p><span>Shelter is good and there is water available. Prices are very reasonable and it is close to the charming town. </span></p>
<p>There is a toilet and cold shower in the same building as the port office. <span>The port office is in the low white building in the NE corner of the quay and is only open during the morning.</span><span> T</span><span>here is however a guard who can show you where to berth 24/7.</span></p>
<p>It is possible to anchor off the beach, <span>Play Francesca.</span> where there is good holding. Permission is necessary first. <span>You are not allowed to anchor closer to Caleta del Sebo. </span></p>
