<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Arrecife has been the capital of Lanzarote since 1852. The city owes its name to the rock reef ('Arrecife' is Spanish for 'reef') which covers the beach located in the city.</span></p>

<p><span><span>In the approaches to port attention must be paid to the outlying reefs. Maintain a quarter mile distance off Punta de la Lagarta and round the south wall keeping the buoy to the south.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Full details of the approach to Puerto Naos can be found on the <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.caleromarinas.com/marinas/lanzarote/en/servicio_varadero/arrival-procedure/">Marina Lanzarote website</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Important Notice April 2016:</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Works being carried out to the extend the Puerto de los Mármoles breakwater have modified some of the navigational lights. The end of the breakwater is now marked at the SE point by an E. Cardinal tower with an accumulative height of 16m, 3M range and light sequence: VQ(3)W5s . The SW point of the breakwater is marked by a green mast:  (Fl.(2)G7s9m1M)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Signalling the Works area, about 450m from the end of the breakwater (28º 57.571  13º 3.876W), is a green pillar buoy: (FlG5s7M)</strong></p>

<p><span>If staying on anchor in Arrecife, the onlly crew that really need to be concerned about checking in with Immigration and have passports stamped are likely to be non-EU citizens having previously checked out of the EU and now expecting to fly home via the UK. In these circumstances, crew should visit the “Policia de Fronteras” office in Puerto de los Mármoles, open Mon-Fri from 8am – 2pm (approx. 10€ in a taxi or about an hour on foot).</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Naos, 1 mile north of the town, is the old fishing harbour and shares its entrance with the commercial harbour - Puerto de los Marmoles. For details of approach to the harbour see the marina website linked to above in Location.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>Whilst previous anchorages included the Puerto Naos harbour and below the Castillo San José, these are no longer valid options. Many boats still enjoy the anchorage next to the Castillo San Gabriel (now a History Museum) in the original “Puerto de Arrecife”, (rocky) in the southeast corner of the harbour. Take care with the depth (max. 3m). Anchoring here is not recommended when the wind is between S and W, but is very secure in the prevailing NE winds. Dinghy access via the steps on the breakwater, which via the bridge leads straight into the town centre.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; ">Following the channel into the harbour, the buildings and marina pontoons are clearly visible to port. <span>The fishing dock on the land side of the harbour where the fishing boats tie up to the wall is marked with green cylindrical tower with light sequence Fl.(3)G.9s.9m.1M.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Dredging work is currently underway to clear 5m draught along the length of the entry channel.</p>
<p>Once inside the harbour, the two hoisting slips are visible at most NE point of the marina and the first pontoon after these is the visitors’ arrival berth and fuelling pontoon. The marina office is clearly identified for arranging a berth. Pontoon gates are open during the day and closed at night.</p>
<p><span>English is widely understood here.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other options</strong></span></p>
<p>Visiting yachts may use the old quay in Arrecife for short stays, normally stern-to the southern pontoon. There are also a few moorings here.</p>
<p>Some pontoons have been installed close to the yacht club (just north of the tall hotel tower), but these should only be used at high water or by shallow draft boats.</p>
