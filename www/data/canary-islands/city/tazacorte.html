<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is now protected by a large, new breakwater making the entrance much safer, even with a large westerly swell. This breakwater also minimises any the swell entering the marina.</p>
<p>There is now a modern marina inside this harbour.</p>
<p>When closing with the harbour beware of the extensive fish farms to the NW of the entrance.</p>
<p>On arrival, report to the port office. </p>
