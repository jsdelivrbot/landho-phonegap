<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour has no outlying dangers, and the entrance, open to the east, is straightforward once the end of the mole has been located. </p>
<p>The harbour does not have much room, and visiting yachts should anchor in the eastern part of the harbour keeping well clear of the ferries. If there is space, arriving yachts may come alongside the quay by the fixed crane and travelift pen. </p>
<p>The four pontoons are all taken up by small local boats.</p>
