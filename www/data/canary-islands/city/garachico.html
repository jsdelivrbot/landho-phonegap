<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an old seaside town on the NW coast of Tenerife with a brand new marina.  It's about 60km west of the capital Santa Cruz, and 50km from the north airport, 67km from the southern one.</p>
<p>The town itself is nestled below a very high cliff, with twisting cobbled streets and a wonderful atmosphere. This area is very Spanish still and probably the least spoilt coastal area of Tenerife.</p>
<p>Position 28°22′20″N,16°45′50″W.</p></div></div>
