<div class="hello"><div><p>The resort of Los Cristianos used to be one of the favourite ports among cruising sailors. Sadly the situation changed and for quite a while visiting yachts were made distinctly unwelcome by the authorities. Now, whilst there is still no space in the marina, the boatyard has started to welcome international yachts as well as local yachts.</p>
<p><span>Anchoring is however severely resticted here. </span>The port is a thriving whale watching centre and commercial port.</p>
<p>Position 28°93'N,16° 43'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting skippers are required to report on arrival at the port office, which has a yellow door and is located on the first floor inside the ferry terminal building. </p>
<p>The port office (Tel. 922 790827, Fax 922 797863) is open 0800-1430 seven days a week, but depending on ferry and hydrofoil movements; if the officials are not in the office, they will be somewhere in the port.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Anchoring has been prohibited inside the harbour since 1998. A port launch used to visit any yacht anchored and ask them to anchor further out. </span></p>
<p><span>The designated yacht anchorage is to the SE of the green starboard buoy marking the entrance into the harbour. This is both a long dinghy ride away from the shore and facilities and also prone to swell, so few yachts remain here longer than absolutely necessary.</span></p>
<p>If you anchor off Las Vistas beach, to the SW of the port, harbour authorities will ask you to move and you risk being fined.</p>
<p>The marina here is full, with a long waiting list for permanent berths, therefore there is no space available for transient yachts.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be landed by the fishermen's cooperative quay, on the inside, by the fuel dock. Dinghy thefts have been reported here. There are showers on the public beach.</p>
<p>Lift out at the boatyard here is now possible for international yachts. The boatyard - <span>MARINA SECA LOS CRISTIANOS -</span> belongs to the Port Authority, so prices are very reasonable. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CanaryIslands/LosCristianos?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyards</a></strong> for more details.</p>
