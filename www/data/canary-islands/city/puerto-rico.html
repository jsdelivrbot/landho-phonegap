<div class="hello"><div><p>The white buildings covering the hills easily identify Puerto Rico from seaward, although one has to sail in fairly close before the marina entrance becomes clear. There are two well-protected harbours either side of a large common breakwater. The eastern harbour, Puerto Base, is for visiting yachts, while the western harbour, Puerto Escala, is used mainly by local craft.</p>
<p>Both harbours are run by the same office and skippers should tie alongside the main quay in the eastern harbour just inside the breakwater and report to the office at the end of the quay to be assigned their berth. The marina is usually full so it is best to phone in advance to find out if there is any space available. The office (Tel.0034 928 561141) is open permanently and monitors VHF channel 8 at all times.</p>
