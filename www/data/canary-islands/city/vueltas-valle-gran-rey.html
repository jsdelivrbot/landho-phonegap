<div class="hello"><div><p id="content">Due to a large breakwater,  the old commercial port now has space for visiting yachts.</p>
<p id="content">It is also possible to anchor in the bay south of the harbour in 8 to 12m, in sand. Open to the west and subject to gusty winds caused by the high cliffs.</p>
<p id="content">The port office is in the building by the harbour gates (Tel. 922 805476). There is water on the quay, also showers in the Cofradia building.</p>
