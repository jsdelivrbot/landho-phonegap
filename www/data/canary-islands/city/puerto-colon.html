<div class="hello"><div><p>This attractive marina fronts the large resort of Playa de las Americas, a few miles west of Los Cristianos. The curved breakwater gives good protection to the small harbour, and an esplanade and pier make it a pleasant place for an evening stroll. Breakwaters have also been built close by to protect the beaches and should not be confused with the marina entrance.</p>
<p>Position 28° 04'50"N, 16° 44'15"W (marina)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The control tower office (Tel. 922 714211, Fax 922 715550) keeps a permanent watch on VHF channels 9 &amp; 16. As the marina is usually full, one should only arrive after having received confirmation of a vacancy. On arrival, the captain should visit the port captain's office with the ship's papers, crew list and passports. The office is located in the control tower on the starboard side of the marina entrance, open 0900-1400, 1600-1800 daily.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Puerto Colon is very active, being the base of several day excursion boats and also many local yachts, so there is rarely any space for visitors.
The marina should not be entered without prior arrangement as even the reception dock, which also doubles as a fuel dock, is often occupied. On arrival the captain should visit the port captain's office located in the Control Tower (0034 922 714211) on the starboard side of the marine entrance.
In an emergency come alongside the fuel dock on the starboard side of the entrance. </p>
