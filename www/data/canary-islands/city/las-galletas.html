<p>This small fishing port lies on the southern tip of Tenerife. One of the last traditional fishing harbours left in Tenerife, fresh fish can be bought daily.</p>
<p>The town surrounds the harbour with supermarkets, pharmacy, banks, shops, medical care, etc. all within walking distance<span>. </span><span>It is a charming, laid-back town with attractive narrow streets and a private marina.</span></p>
<p><span>The harbour is situated next to the nature reserve of “Punta Rasca”, with its beaches and coves, and stands under the watchful eye of Mount Teide, a truly magnificent panorama.</span></p>
<p>Position 28º 00'N, 16º 39'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/InsideMarina_sized.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>To approach the marina, sail quite close to the land until the green harbour light on the breakwater is seen. Do not go too far to port as there are rocks. Be aware that there is a ruin on land with a green door which looks like a green navigation mark!</p>
<p>Do not anchor in front of the town, it is full of rocks!</p>
<p>Manouvering in the marina is tight. Whilst the pontoons do not have locked gates, there is 24 hour security patrols.</p>
