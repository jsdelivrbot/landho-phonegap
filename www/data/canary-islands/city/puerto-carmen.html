<div class="hello"><div><p>The port is busy with excursion boats and with the remaining space largely being taken up by local boats on their own moorings, it is best avoided by yachts.</p>
<p>In settled weather it is possible to anchor just outside the breakwater and take the dinghy inside if wishing to visit the resort.</p>
<p>There are no yachting facilities but the main road running through the huge holiday resort of Puerto del Carmen has many supermarkets, banks, bars and restaurants.</p></div></div>
