<div class="hello"><div><p><span>A long wharf protects the bay and a breakwater was built in the summer of 2005 that has created an inner harbour in the northern part of the harbour.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The entrance to the inner harbour is very difficult to see as you enter the outer harbour. Cruisers advise to simply head for the red and green oblisks which will be in line. Turn 90 degrees to starboard and then 90 degrees to port.</span></span></p>
<p>Yachts can berth against the wall but there is a shortage of ladders and bollards.</p>
<p>The wall to starboard is easier and has ladders but should be avoided if bad weather from the south is expected.  Instead lie starboard-side-to on the wall facing the dinghy slip.  It is higher and has no ladders but is safe in all conditions.</p>
<p>Protection in the port is generally good but in July and August a strong local wind, the Levante, sometimes rolls down the hills into the harbour, making manoeuvering difficult.</p>
<p>The port office is above the small restaurant, the white building on the north quay. Port Authority speak English.</p>
<p>Facilities in Estaca are basic with no electricity, water or diesel available.</p>
<p>The nearest supermarket and cash machine are in Valverde (the island capital), 10km inland (€1 on the bus or €10 in a taxi).  For a small island the supermarkets are reported to be very good.</p>
