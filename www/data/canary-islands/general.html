<p><strong><i>Note </i></strong>- Type L plugs/outlets may have different pin spacing.  The smaller and closer pins are for a rated current of 10 A, the bigger and wider pins are for a rated current of 16 A.</p>
<p><strong>LPG / Gas</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">NuB is the name of the most commonly-used domestic gas in the Canaries. In Gran Canaria, some propane bottles can be re-filled with propane (see below), however, in the rest of the islands only butane is available so propane &amp; butane bottles will be re-filled with butane.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The following range of bottles can be filled in the Canaries. <br/>Brining a kit of adaptors with you will unfortunately not help; bottles in the Canaries have to be filled directly from the plant’s authorised taps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">All Spanish bottles;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">Calor Gas bottles with a blue butane or orange propane fitting;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">A number of US and Scandinavian bottles with a left-hand feminine fitting;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">French Jumbo bottles;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align: justify; ">Any other bottle that coincides with the Spanish fittings.</span></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "> </span></p>
<p><i><strong>Note: </strong><br/></i></p>
<ul>
<i>
<li><span>Some Calor propane bottles have an escape valve that is slightly raised. This creates a problem since the filling head cannot fit over it.</span></li>
<li>Also some black, plastic American bottles, with a central slightly interior valve, cannot be filled.</li>
<li><span>Where a safety date stamp shows, this cannot have expired or it won’t be filled.</span></li>
<li>Payment by cash only</li>
<li><span>Camping Gaz canisters can be exchanged at the local fuel station.</span></li>
</i>
<p> </p>
</ul>
<p><span>Filling is done in Lanzarote at the Arrecife DISA plant (ask in marinas for the availability of delivery service) from 9am - 3pm weekdays. </span></p>
<p><span>In Las Palmas de Gran Canaria filling is done at the DISA Salinetas plant from 9am - 11am weekdays. Maximum 3 bottles per person. Most propane bottles/tanks can be filled here. <br/></span><span>Take the highway from Muelle Deportivo towards the airport, about 17 km. Take the Salinetas exit. There is an IKEA Almacen, which is the second IKEA on the way to the airport. Go past that and take a right on the second roundabout, in front of the Mercadona supermarket. The entrance to the DISA plant is on your left. </span></p>

<div><p>International dialing code for Canary Islands is +34.</p>
<p>Each Spanish network provides coverage of the Canary Islands. This includes the 7 main islands - Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma, Gomera, Hierro - as well as Alegranza, Graciosa, Montaña Clara, Roque del Este, Roque del Oeste und Lobos.</p>
<p>To listen to voicemail just dial 901.</p>
<p>Standard national post is slow, but often poses less of a customs problem if wanting to bring in spare parts. If you are not in too much of a rush, this can be the most economical and reliable option.

<div><p>All major tourist areas, larger towns and ports are well served by buses.
Taxis are plentiful and inexpensive.  Town taxis run on meters but for longer trips it is best to ascertain price. 
Car hire is reasonably priced.
There are many flights both scheduled and charter to the international airports. Flights available to mainland Spain and Interisland flights are frequent but they need to be booked well in advance.
