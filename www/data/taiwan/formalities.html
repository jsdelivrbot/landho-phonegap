<div><p><i><strong>Note:</strong> You will definitely be refused entry if coming from China (apart from Hong Kong or Macau) as it is not legal to come from a port in mainland China.</i></p>
<p>No other harbour apart from a Port of Entry can be visited before clearing into the country.</p>
<p>At all Ports of Entry, the Port Authority should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 before entering the harbour. When approaching the port, contact Port Authority (official callsign "Kaohsiung VTS", but responds to other meaningful callsigns as well) well in advance (10nm).</p>
<p>Then proceed to Coast Guard check point.</p>
<p>Health Department (Disease Control) should also be visited upon arrival.</p>
<p>Customs generally ignore yachts. Nor is it necessary to visit the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>The MTNet (Maritime Transport Network Portal) should be used whenever entering or leaving a  Port of Entry). Allow at least 2 weeks before your first arrival in the country for processing the initial documents. See <a href="Countries/Taiwan/?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents</strong></a> for the details. <i>(<b>Note:</b> April 2016 The MTNet website does not currently link to the necessary documents)</i></p>
<p>It may be necessary to use a shipping agent to process the Entry Permit  application or to obtain the help of a local contact.</p>

<p><strong>Visiting non Ports of Entry</strong><br/> Other small harbours (usually called "fishing harbours") can be visited. This used to be a quite a hassle, which involved bit of paper work (all in Chinese).</p>
<p>Since 2006, many harbours are accessible simply via MTNet. Sometimes you might be asked to fill additional form (Project of Yacht Navigation). These "open" fishing harbours  (FH) include: Kaohsiung Gushan and Qijin FH, Keelung Badouzi FH (a.k.a. Bisha FH), Xinzhu FH, Tainan Anping FH, Tainan County Jiangjun FH, Kaohsiung County Xingda FH, Taidong County Xingang and Jinzun FH, Penghu has 11 FH (Qimei, Jibei, ...), Longdong, Houbihu.</p>
<p><strong>Day Sailing</strong><br/> For day sailing, you need to fill a form <a href="http://www.cga.gov.tw/GipOpen/wSite/public/Data/f1268378103310.pdf">Project of Yacht  Navigation</a>).</p>
<p>It should be delivered (hard copy or by fax) to your nearest coast guard station before your departure. The coast guard might come to your berth, but usually you will have to stop at the check-point.</p>
<p>Please check with your local contact. There is an online form for this, but it is only in Chinese, you need to create an account, so the paper form seems more practical.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for more than six months.</p>
<p>All nationalities must obtain a visa before arrival from a Republic of China embassy, consulate or trade mission abroad. The most convenient offices will probably be in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore or Thailand. From these offices one may obtain a visa or letter of recommendation exchangeable for a visa. The letters may be exchanged at a Republic of China diplomatic or consular office en route, or on arrival at Keelung or Kaohsuing ports, these two being the only ports where these letters may be exchanged.</p>
<p>It has been reported that it is possible to be granted a visa on arrival, as long as a prior e-mail has been sent to the Ministry of Transport giving details, and asking for such a visa as well as for entry. The email address is <a href="mailto:tbroc@tbroc.gov.tw">tbroc@tbroc.gov.tw</a> In this case, a 30 day visa may be granted.</p>
<p>A visitors' visa is valid for three months from the date of issue and is good for a single visit for a 60-day period. Provided one can give grounds, one may apply for a maximum of two extensions, each for 60 days. The Foreign Affairs Police speak English, 7 Chungsiao E Road, Section 1, Taipei. Tel. 381-7475. Application should be made to them for visa extensions.</p>
<p>Citizens of the People's Republic of China are refused entry.</p>
<p>Visa-exempt entry for citizens of certain countries only appears to applicable if arriving by air.</p>

<div><p>This web-based system is the best option for dealing with the necessary paperwork.</p>
<p><i>(<b>Note:</b> April 2016 The MTNet website does not currently link to the necessary documents)</i></p>
<p><strong>MTNet</strong><br/> Go to <a href="http://www.mtnet.gov.tw/"><strong>www.mtnet.gov.tw</strong></a> and follow the link "Foreign Yacht Arrival / Departure Port Application System" at the bottom. (<strong><a href="https://web02.mtnet.gov.tw/redirect.jsp?LinkID=16">Direct link</a>)</strong><br/> Register first. Arrival and departure procedures are similar, only different forms are used.</p>
<ol>
<li> Login and fill the form "Foreign Yacht arrival pre-registration". If you can’t see it, click "New Task" in the left navigation column. It has been reported that the web is displayed in Chinese for some users. If this happens to you, try to contact someone in Taiwan to help you through it (e.g. Peter Pan in Kaohsiung).</li>
<li> When looking for codes of Taiwanese harbours, enter code TW and search. It will produce list of all Taiwanese harbours. Selecting from the list can be another challange, because the romanization is sometimes very unusual (not what you find e.g. on Google Maps). Try to match the Chinese characters.</li>
<li> When your application is approved, you should receive email notification. This notification is in Chinese. Google Translate should be able to decipher it. Applications are usually approved fairly quickly.</li>
<li> Your port clearance (arrival/departure) is found in the left navigation column. Click "Foreign Yacht Arrival/Departure Port Pre-application Form Print", then click "Print" on the right. The form should contain a watermark stamp "Permit of ship’s arrival and departure".</li>
