<div class="hello"><div><p>Kaohsiung, on Taiwan’s SW coast, is the country's second largest city and its largest port, as well as one of the major container ports of the world.
It is very cosmopolitan in character and a vibrant commercial centre. Unfortunately its many any industries result in a frequent layer of smog.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Once inside the main port, proceed to the security wharf (port side). You cannot not miss it, all the personnel wear vivid orange overalls.</p>
<p>There, Immigration, Quarantine and Marina officials will ask permission to board. They are likely to do a quick search and check you are healthy. The marina official will accompany the boat to the marina and help with the paperwork and also, possibly, getting money from the bank, a phone SIM card and arranging internet access.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If a boat or ship weighs over 20 ton they must have a pilot to exit or enter Kaohsiung. This applies to local and foreign vessels.</p>
<p>Contact Peter Pan well in advance to secure a space at the Shaochuantou Marina. He is usually able to accommodate you, but space is very limited.</p>
<p>Yachts must enter through the North Entrance (022 37.1683 N, 120 15.3784 E). Contact "KAOHSIUNG VTS" on VHF Channel 11. You might be approached by Coast Guard vessel, especially at night.</p>
<p>It might take the watch at the port control tower a while to understand that you are a sailboat (if that is the case). They might ask you to increase speed, change course, etc. Patiently explain your situation if you are sailing and cannot comply to their satisfaction. If you don't have an AIS, explain soon otherwise they will be confused as to why they cannot see you. </p>
<p>When the behind the breakwater, pass through a narrow channel and proceed to a Coast Guard check point (022 37.0305 N, 120 16.0464 E). You will tie against some nasty black bumpers or tires and rusty bollards. Watch out for the pilot boats and fishermen, rules of the road or common courtesy does not apply.</p>
