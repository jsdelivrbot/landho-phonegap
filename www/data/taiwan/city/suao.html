<div class="hello"><div><p>Suao is a seaport in the NE of the island, with its sea-related industries to the north of the town and the original fishing port to the south. Here is to be found the interesting fishermen's wharf with its antique fishing boats and shouting fishmongers. Good seafood abounds in the restaurants along the wharf's main street.</p>
