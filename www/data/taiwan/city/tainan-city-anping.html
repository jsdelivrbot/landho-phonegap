<div class="hello"><div><p>Outside Anping Harbour there are extensive oyster farms, so approach with caution. If you approach the port at 90 degrees from approx. 2 miles off, you should be able to navigate safe passage through the farms. Obviously, approach at night is not advisable. There are no lights and no markers at all.</p>
<p>The security dock is on your port side as you enter the harbour. The marina is situated at the head of the basin.</p>
<p><span>There are very limited facilities currently, except public toilets, but there are plans to build further.</span></p>
