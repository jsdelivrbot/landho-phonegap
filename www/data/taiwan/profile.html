<ul>
<li>Taiwan, officially called the Republic of China, is a large island straddling the Tropic of Cancer, about 120 miles off the Chinese mainland. Taiwan is a prosperous country, largely due to its exporting industry, and it is also one of unspoilt natural beauty.</li>
<li>Known all over the world for its yacht-building industry, Taiwan was the first Asian country to mass produce fibreglass boats and its leading position is still unassailed in the Far East. Very few of those yachts return to Taiwan, although every year a number of owners come to take possession of their craft and sail them away. Unfortunately this beautiful island is not geared up for cruising so these new owners have to savour other cruising grounds.</li>
<li>English is quite common, but a contact who can speak Chinese is a plus, especially when looking for parts, material, etc. People are very helpful and there’s usually someone around who can speak English well enough. </li>
<li>Repairs can be arranged. But only slipways are usually available or crane. No travel-lift. Workers are usually working on fishing boats and are not accustomed to do fine yachtie finish. Finer work could be arranged via yacht building yards, such as Tayana.</li>
<li>In most ports, berthing is at a fixed concrete quay (more suited to big ships) but there are floating docks at few places.</li>
<li>Taiwan is a useful place to experience chinese culture without the heavy bureaucracy involved in visitng the mainland.</li>
