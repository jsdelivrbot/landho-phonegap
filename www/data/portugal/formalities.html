                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p>All boats arriving from abroad must contact either a port or marina office.</p>
<p>Formalities, which can be lengthy, should be carried out by visiting the office. Have to hand the documents described in <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Portugal/?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></p>
<p>A clearance form will then need to be completed in duplicate, one to be retained by the marina or port office, the other for police, Immigration and Customs.</p>
<p>Non-EU yachts will receive a transit log (livrete de transito) against payment of a small fee. The log is stamped at the first port and must be stamped at the last port of departure. A receipt will be issued for the payment of the annual lights and buoys tax (taxa de farolagem). The two documents should be kept with the ship's papers while in Portuguese waters.</p>
<p>The marinas and yacht harbours at Viana do Castelo, Povoa do Varzim, Leixoes, Nazare, Peniche, Cascais, Lisbon  (Alcantara and Marina Expo), Sesimbra, Sines, Lagos, Portimao, Vilamoura and Vila Real Santo Antonio are designated to deal with clearance formalities for cruising boats arriving from abroad.</p>
<p><strong>EU Yachts</strong><br/> Such yachts need to clear out only if leaving Portugal for a non-EU destination.</p>
<p><strong>Non-EU Yachts</strong><br/> Foreign yachts departing Portugal, the transit log must be stamped by both the Capitania and the Guarda Nacional Republicana.</p>
<p>If arriving from or continuing on to the Azores or Madeira, customs clearance does not have to be obtained as both these island groups are administered by Portugal. However, on arrival in those places the Capitania must be contacted as normal, and a new transit log may be issued.</p>

<div><p>Portugal is a member of the Schengen Agreement Area. See <a href="General/EuropeanUnion">Noonsite' Schengen page </a> for more details on the immigration rules.</p>
<p>Visa extensions may be obtained from the Foreigners Registration Service, Avenida Antonio Augusto de Aguiar 18, Lisbon (or regional offices). If possible, check in advance as to what documentation will be required, including application form, two photographs, proof of medical insurance, proof of ability to pay (credit card), a copy of the marina contract, and a criminal record report from the Portuguese courts (valid for 90 days). Other documents may also be required. If you need to apply for a further extension, try to do so before the court report expires, otherwise you will have to obtain another one. It may be the case that the court report is not required in some places.</p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared on arrival.</p>
<p>Duty-free goods in excess of the limits allowed are permitted as long as they remain on board.</p>
<p>EU regulations apply concerning temporary importation (TI) of yachts. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/General/EuropeanUnion/VAT">EU VAT</a> page for more information.</p>
<p><strong>VAT Cautionary Note<br/></strong><span>(May 2013): Not all Customs Authorities are familiar with the EU regulations concerning TI. Leixoes (Porto) Customs have recently impounded and charged VAT to a US boat stating it has overstayed its permitted 18 months in the EU. They do not recognise that the Channel Islands are outside the EU VAT area (it is) and also state that 18 months is the TI limit, and you cannot exit and then re-enter the EU to re-set the TI clock. This is not true.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Yachts must carry their original registration document, insurance policy and ship's radio licence. One member of the crew must have a radio operator’s certificate.  The skipper must also have a certificate of competance and all crew members a passport.</p>
<p>EU yachts need evidence of VAT status. Also have a crew list (preferably complete with the ship's stamp) showing passport numbers, date of birth and when and where they joined the boat and deparure information.</p>
<p>Additional papers required may include evidence of health insurance (or European Health Insurance Card) and the ship's log.</p>
<p>Photocopies of any of these documents are not acceptable to the police unless they are notarised as genuine copies. Any discrepancies in documentation could involve either confiscation of the boat or a substantial fine, or both.</p>
<p>Non-EU yachts should ensure that they have documented evidence that they have not been in the EU for a continuous period longer than 180 days.</p>
<p>Finally you must have an Ensign (the national maritime flag of your boat's country of registration). In addition, if your boat is not Portuguese registered, a Portuguese courtesy ensign.</p></div>

<div><p>Circulation Tax is payable by boat owners who keep their boat in Portugal for a continuous period of 183 days in any tax year, and must be paid every year. Boats <span style="text-align: justify; ">registered before 1986 or with an engine of less than 27hp are exempt.</span></p>

<p><strong>Anchoring Restrictions</strong><span> <br/>Restrictions on where you can anchor in Portugal relate to a “default” EU law which forbids anchoring or manoeuvring under engine within 500m (can be 1,000m) of the "shore"/"beach"/"swimming area" unless there is a swimming area marked out off the beach. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Italy/mediterranean-anchoring-restrictions">report</a></strong> for more details.</span></p></div>
