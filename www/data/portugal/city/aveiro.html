<div class="hello"><div><p>This <code>city of canals</code> is an attractive place to visit with its maze of canals, brightly painted fishing boats and sandy beaches, but its entry is not for the faint-hearted in anything more than calm weather. It lies approximately 30nm south of Oporto and the mouth of the Rio Vouga.</p>
<p>Position 40°38.1'N, 8°46'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is not usually any marina here available to visiting yachts, but the anchorages are sheltered. The river is generally too shallow to allow most boats to reach the city, which is 8 miles from the entrance.</p>
<p>Entry should be made around high water only and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> if there is a swell or any amount of wind. In such conditions the entrance is dangerous.</p>
<p>Also be aware of the unlit HT cables (clearance 8m) across the Canal da Mira which enters the main canal, Canal de Embocadura, on the sta'bd side shortly after passing the southern breakwater.</p>
<p>The best anchorage is at Sao Jacinto. The entrance is dredged to 3m and marked by buoys.</p>
<p>There is a small marina at the town of Torreira, 10.5 miles north of the river entrance. This marina however is used by very small fishing boats with depths of 1m, so is not suitable for yachts.</p>
