<div class="hello"><div><p>Peniche is a busy fishing town with a large harbour, lying in the shelter of a large headland. Until the mid 18th century it was an island, but silting has now joined it to the mainland. The town is well-known for its consistant surfing conditions and its lace-making.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Peniche_KieranHiggs.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>This harbour has all-weather access but often has an uncomfortable swell inside. The marina is inside the port on the south side of the peninsula <i>(photo courtesy of Kieran Higgs)</i>.</p>
<p>There is now a new visitors' pontoon in place in the marina.</p>
<p>It is possible to moor against the wall on the opposite side of the harbour. However, because of the tidal range and amount of wash from the ferries and fishing boats, care is needed. It can be bumpy here.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the SE part of the harbour. The holding here is good but the ground is possibly foul. There is also an anchorage on the north side of the peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>Ilha Berlenga</strong><br/> This island is a nature reserve just 7 nm west of the Peniche Peninsula. There is an anchorage on the SE side, below the lighthouse, which has moorings used by day tripper boats that are available to use for overnighting. A bar/restaurant,a simple shop and fort used as a hostel is all that is here. The clear water is particularly good for diving and snorkeling, however this is only suitable for overnight if conditions are settled.</p>
