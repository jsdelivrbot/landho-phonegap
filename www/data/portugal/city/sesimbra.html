<div class="hello"><div><p>The port is 1.5 miles south of the town. The marina here is inside the port and is very sheltered. Advisable to enquire about berth before arrival as the marina, managed by the yacht club, is very small.</p>
<p>Alternatively there is an anchorage in 5m just north of the harbour, clear of the fairway.</p>
<p>Beware of the strong northerlies blowing down from the high ground in late afternoon/evenings.</p>
<p>Port control  VHF channel 11.</p>
