<div class="hello"><div><p>Located at the mouth of the River Arade, Portimao is a natural harbour. It is, conveniently, just 35 minutes drive from Faro airport, close to the well-known Praia de Roche and opposite the village of Ferrragudo.</p>
<p>The river also provides access to the ancient city of Silves. Sadly, because of two low bridges over the river at Portimão, it is impossible for yachts to reach the city. However, it is possible to anchor just inside the breakwaters at the entrance to the Arade and use a dinghy for the trip.</p>
<p>Position 37°08'N, 8°32'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Visitors normally berth at Portimão Marina, located on the west side, just  inside the entrance to the port, where there is good shelter. Prices here are  high however.</p>
<p>Further up the river is a small craft marina, Porta de S.Francisco, and also    floating pontoons closer to the low bridges.</p>
<p>Be aware that the flood and ebb streams run hard here, so it is necessary to  berth bows to the stream.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> There is also an anchorage, in 4m, inside the east mole, but it is subject to  wash from the ferries. An alternative anchorage may be found in the small creek  (Ferragudo) about a mile from the entrance, on the eastern side of the river.</p>
