<div class="hello"><div><p>The river Guadiana, at its seaward end, forms the border between Portugal and Spain and has been a centre of trade for thousands of years. The town of  Vila Real St António was rebuilt in the 18th century after being wiped out in a flood.</p>
<p>The river is navigatable for 20 miles to the town of Alcoutim.</p>
<p>Position 37°10.8’N, 07°24.5’W</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If yacht is registered in the EU and all her crew are EU nationals, completion of the usual multi-part form in the marina office is sufficient.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is necessary to visit the offices of the Policia Maritima and Imigracao at the Capitania, about 50m south of the marina.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Entrance over the bar is possible 3hrs each side of HW, but is best just before HW due to the strength of the tidal stream. If navigating up river at night, take care as some of the buoys are unlit.</p>
<p>The marina here, is on the west bank of the river. If waiting for slack water (advisable) before berthing (or un-berthing), berth on the <b>inside </b>of the waiting pontoon. Mooring on the river side is not permitted.</p>
<p>The Guadiana is navigable all the way up to Pomarão, half way between Alcoutim and Mértola on the east bank of the river. Between Alcoutim and Pomarão it is very beautiful and remote. There are pontoons off Alcoutim, Sanlúcar and Pomarão and off some smaller villages, some with electricity and water. It is safe to anchor anywhere.</p>
<p>The road bridge beyond the marina, has sufficient clearance for most masted boats, but checking is essential.</p>
<p>See<strong> <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Spain/Ayamonte">Ayamonte</a></strong> for more information on facilities on this river.</p>

      All facilities, fuel, WiFi, yacht club, ATM, bar and restaurant, 5 ton crane. Some repairs. Security.<br>
The marina is badly affected by both the river current and tides, and should therefore be entered and left near slack water. Berthing is tight and maneuvering can be difficult. <br>
Close to the centre of town.
