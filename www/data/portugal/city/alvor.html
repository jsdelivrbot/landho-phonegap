<div class="hello"><div><p>Well sheltered once inside. Night entry or in strong onshore winds not advisable.</p>
<p>There are two possible anchorages here. One, to port, just inside the moles which protect the entrance. The other at the end of the winding channel leading to the town.</p>
<p>It is best to enter on a rising tide, when the sand banks are still visible but mistakes can be rectified.</p>
<p>The town can provide most needs; provisons, banks, bars and restaurants.</p>
