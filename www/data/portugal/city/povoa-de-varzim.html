<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying 10 nm N of Leixoes and only 18km from Porto airport, Povoa is a useful port. It is however not a particularly attractive one and although the town is over 100 years old, it has been taken over by high rise flats and hotels for tourists attracted by the long sandy beach.</p>
<p>A convenient stopover in the summer, but be aware that most of Portugal has fiestas in the summer and particularly in August the revelry can go on into the early hours.</p>
<p>Position 41° 22.2' N,8° 45.6'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach</strong><br/> When entering, the northern breakwater should be given a wide berth as there is  often breaking water at its extremity. In addition, there is an isolated rock  close to the inside of the northern breakwater. After entering between the two  breakwaters, turn to starboard passing around a row of unlit green buoys which  mark shallow water near the breakwater.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that the entrance can be rough when there is a heavy swell  running and on occasions, <strong>the harbour may be closed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong><br/> The fishing boats use the northern part of the harbour and the marina lies in  the southern section.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/PovoaDeVarzim_KieranHiggs.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina here<i> (photo courtesy of Kieran Higgs) </i>provides an economical longer-term berth for cruising yachts. As  with the majority of ports on this coast however, care should be taken if  deciding to winter your boat here in the water, due to the surge that develops  during southerly winter storms. Improvements to the breakwater have helped dampen the swell somewhat. However, care should be taken with  tying up your boat correctly to allow for surge, in particular in the winter and  if leaving your boat for any length of time.</p>
<p>The new security gates installed at Povoa Marina do  also operate with traditional magnetic cards, which are available for those  visitors who wouldd rather not register biometric data (finger printing) with the  marina.</p>
<p>The marina has hard standing for approx. 100 yachts, ideal for winter storage  although not as a place for winter repairs as electricity usage is limited. Hard  standing should be booked in advance (see boatyards for further details).</p>
<p>Local contractors can be sourced via the marina, however there is very little  available in the town in the way of boat parts.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Anchoring in the harbour is permitted provided that neither the marina entrance  is impeded nor the fishing vessels using the northern breakwater. The NE corner  of the harbour (in 3m) is a possible spot.</p>
