            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The approaches to the River Tagus (Rio Tejo) are straightforward, but keep to the marked channel as there are various shallows in the approaches.</p>
<p>Yachts entering or leaving Lisbon are required to keep VHF watch on channels 12,16 and 13. The working channel for "Lisboa Port Control" is 64.</p>
<p><strong>Marinas</strong></p>
<p>Berths for visiting yachts in the northern basins are limited as many of the pontoon spaces in the marinas are taken up by local craft. There is however a new marina in the southern basin which has plenty of space.</p>
<p>The marinas at<strong> <a href="Countries/Portugal/Cascais">Cascais</a> </strong>and <a href="Countries/Portugal/Oeiras"><strong>Oeiras</strong></a> also provide easy access to the city of Lisbon and are less crowded alternatives.</p>
<p>Coming from seaward the first berthing option is Doca do Bom Succeso, immediately past Torre de Belém. There are no special places allocated for visitors and it is predominantly filled with local traffic.</p>
<p>Further upstream, past the monument to Henry the Navigator, is Doca de Belém. Visitors should tie up initially by the fuel station opposite the entrance. For a small fee visitors can use the facilities of the Associação Naval de Lisboa (Sailing Association) which has its base there. The club secretary is also the best person to consult concerning any repair. Again however, it is likely no space will be available here.</p>
<p>Doca de Santo Amaro, just after the first suspension bridge, is often full of naval craft and harbour launches, as well as suffering from road noise from the metal bridge above and bars nearby.</p>
<p>Further upstream still is Doca de Alcantâra, behind the container and cruise ship terminal (the first place with clearance authorities), and finally the new Marina Parque das Nações which is the largest and newest marina in Lisbon.</p>
<p>Marina Parque das Nações (on the site of the former EXPO Marina) is 6 miles upriver in the southern basin, accessed via locks open during the day. This is in an attractive setting with interesting site nearby. They offer discounts for winter rates.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> There is an anchorage on the north side of the estuary at Doco de Paco in 7m. It is sheltered from the northerlies and NW'lies.</p>
<p>At Seixal, on the opposite side of the river from Lisbon, there is good shelter in the tributary of the Tagus River. Limited shopping, some restaurants and a frequent ferry accross to Lisbon make this a possible alternative berth.</p>

      Lying 1.2 miles upstream of the large suspension bridge, this is the first place in Lisbon itself to clear in. The basin has been dredged to a depth of 7.2 metres and can receive even the largest yachts. All offices (port captain, customs and Guarda Nacional Republicana) are located nearby. <br>
The swing bridge opens every half hour from Mon-Fri, and is left open during weekends, except if there's a cruise ship moored at the adjacent quay. In this case, it is necessary to request passage by calling the bridge operator on VHF channel 68. The entrance is
well hidden behind a commercial wharf and can be difficult to locate.
<br>
Not particularly attractive suroundings and water can be oily, but ideal if wanting to explore the city as just a 10 minute walk to the tram for the city centre. Offers excellent protection.
