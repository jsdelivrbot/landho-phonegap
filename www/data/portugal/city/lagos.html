<div class="hello"><div><p><span>On approach to the port, be aware that the end of the western breakwater is partially submerged. If entering at night, beware of isolated, black, unlit piles on the port hand side of the channel. Another hazard is the number of fishing buoys and flags immediately outside the outer breakwaters.</span></p>

<p>On arrival, berth on the arrivals pontoon on the sta'board side, just before the lifting bridge. This bridge opens on request, (VHF channel 09) 8am to 10pm (summer) and 9am to 7pm (winter).</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> It is possible to anchor NE of the harbour mole in 3 to 5m. This is exposed to easterly and southerly winds and some SW swell.</p>
