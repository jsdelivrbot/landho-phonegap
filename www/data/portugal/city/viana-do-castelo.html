<div class="hello"><div><p>There is excellent shelter in the marina, which is 1.5 miles up the River Lima.  This marina is to port, just before a low road/rail bridge. A pedestrian swing bridge has now been built across the entrance, but there is a waiting pontoon in the river and the bridge opens on the hour as well as on request.</p>
<p>Beware of strong cross currents at the entrance to the marina.  Note that hazards lie close offshore both north and south of Viana do Castelo - keep outside 20m line. The approach to the marina is dredged to 3m.</p>
<p>Visitors should berth on pontoon D, which is to sta'bd, just inside the entrance.</p>
<p>There is no anchoring in the river.</p>
<p>There are reports that the long fishing harbour to the east of the shipyard is to be converted into a marina, but there is no indication that this has yet been done.</p>
