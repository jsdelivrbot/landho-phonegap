<div class="hello"><div><p>The wide entrance leads into an outer basin from which a narrower entrance leads to the marina. The shelter here is very good but in strong southerlies, the wide entrance can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Be sure to identify the correct entrance as that of the fishing port is close by. There is a large, conspicous hotel to the E of the marina entrance.</p>
<p>On arrival, berth at the reception pontoon and report to the office.</p>
<p>There is no anchoring in the outer harbour.</p>
