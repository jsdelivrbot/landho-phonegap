<div class="hello"><div><p>There is now an attractive alternative to berthing in Leixoes, just north of the UNESCO city of Oporto, with the development of a new marina situated just inside the mouth of the River Douro (2012).</p>
<p>The sand bar which used to exist at the entrance to the River Douro has now been removed and two new breakwaters have been built making the entrance to the River Douro much safer, the entrance being closed much less frequently than in the past.</p>
<p>The new Douro Marina is on the southern banks of the river close to the historic city of Gaia, home of the port wine lodges. From here the city of Oporto can be walked to or easily accessed by the excellent metro/tram system in the city.</p>
<p>Position <span>41° 08' 35"N, 08° 40' 48"W (entrance to the Douro River).</span></p></div></div>

<p>The deep water channel is on the north side of the river.</p>
<p>The floating pontoon in Gaia on the south bank of the Douro River no longer exists. Just to the east of Porto, on the north bank and past the Via de Cintura Inturna road bridge is the Marina do Freixo, run by the Sport Club do Porto. It may be possible to find a berth there.</p>
<p>The Douro Marina <i>(photo courtesy of Kieran Higgs)</i> is located on the south bank of the river. It does, unfortunately, suffer from swell from passing tour boats.</p>
