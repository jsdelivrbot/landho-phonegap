<div class="hello"><div><p>Faro lies in the north west corner of Ria Formosa, which is on Portugal's southern coast. The city has much interesting and ancient architecture. Particularly attractive, is the old part of the city, still surrounded by its Roman walls.</p>
<p>Olhao is in the north east of the Ria. It is a major port and the largest fishing port in the Algarve. It is full of character with Moorish-style architecture.</p>
<p>Position 36°57.8'N, 07°52.2'W (entrance).</p>
<p>When approaching Faro from the West, be aware that there are tuna nets laid to the south of Faro. See report adjacent for further details.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is good shelter once inside among the sand dunes, but the entrance is narrow and approaching at night or in strong winds is not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>Faro</strong><br/> The winding channel is 4.5nm long, with a depth of about 4m.<br/> There is a marina here but it is for small local boats only. Off the town, in sheltered water, there are moorings which may be available or anchor near channel buoy 23.</p>
<p>Land either at the Doca de Recreio, passing under the railway bridge (about 1m clearance at high water) or at one of the three jetties outside. It is then just a 15 minute walk into the town.</p>
<p>If landing in the basin note that the pontoons are closed off by individual security gates and that all east side is reserved for fishermen.</p>
<p>The office of the Capitania (where the Policia Maritima are often found) overlooks the north end of the basin, sharing premises with a small maritime museum.</p>
<p><strong>Olhao</strong><br/> The channel leading to the marina here is 5nm long, with a least depth of just over 2m. Approaching on a rising tide is advisable.</p>
<p>The marina is accessed via a narrow channel in the west bank. The entrance to it is at the far western end of the breakwater. It rarely has room for visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong></p>
<p><i>Culatra Island</i> - This one is at the entrance to the channel leading to Faro and Olhao and is on the inside of a sandy island with beautiful beaches. The holding is generally good in silt/mud in the area north of the fishing harbour but other areas had thick sea grass or old cables. The small village has a few cottages, a cafe and a small hotel. There is a year-round ferry service to Faro.</p>
<p><i>Faro</i><br/> Anchor SW of the Doca de Recreio in 3m. This is under the flight path of the airport, which is one of the busiest during the day (no flights at night).</p>
<p><i>Olhao</i> - The anchorage is in the channel leading to the commercial port, but may not be permitted due to dredging operations.</p>
