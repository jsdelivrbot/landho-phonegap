<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach</strong><br/>The harbour entrance is approximately 0.5 miles, on the east side of S. Julião beacon (0c R 5s), with a range of 14 miles, placed on a grey prismatic tower with red dome, 41 meters high.</p>
<p><strong>Leading Line</strong><br/>The entrance is approached on a 277º course, up to the alignment of the small breakwater beacons, and then the course must be corrected to SW (nearly 225º), in such a way as to pass between the southern breakwater and the top of the pier breakwater.</p>
<p><strong>Entrance</strong><br/>The Yachting Harbour entrance is located between the north and south jetties.</p>
<p><span>Note that the entrance here can become rough with swell from the south combined with the ebb current.</span></p>
<p><span>This small, purpose built marina has excellent facilities and offers a number of services useful to visiting cruisers with multi-lingual staff (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish).</span></p>
<p>The bars, restaurants and shops are just a few feet from the boats and it's a 15 minute walk in to the town (free supermarket shuttle bus).</p>
<p>Many small repairs can be carried out by dedicated marina staff. Use of swimming pool (April to October) and supermarket shuttle are included in the berthing fee.</p>
<p>There is a nice sandy beach next to the marina and several cultural events on during the year.</p>
