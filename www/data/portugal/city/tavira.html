<div class="hello"><div><p>Although the marina is full of local boats, there are moorings in very sheltered water, just off the charming, un-spoilt fishing village. They are under the control of the local Nautical Club.</p>
<p>Do not enter before half flood or at all if the swell is heavy. If the wind and/or swell are onshore, conditions become rougher on the ebb.  Best time for either entering or for leaving is about one hour before high water.</p>
<p>Beware of fishing nets in the approach.</p>
<p>Anchor in about 3m SW of the jetties. Use an anchor light as fishing boats are active 24/7 and be sure to keep clear of the channel.</p>
<p>On shore, near the anchorage, there are restaurants, shops toilets etc. in a small community.</p>
