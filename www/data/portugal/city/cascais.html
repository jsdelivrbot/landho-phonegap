<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina has all-tide access and is well set up for hosting major sailing  events. Whilst service and facilities are excellent, prices are high and many  cruisers feel that the marina is trying to appeal more to the superyacht market.  On arrival, berth at the reception pontoon to be allocated a berth. The visitors' berths appear to be exposed to westerlies, but the substantial breakwater provides ample protection.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anchorages</span></span></p>
<p>There are good anchorages in the bay north of the port which is sheltered from the  prevailing northerlies but is open to the south and east.</p>
