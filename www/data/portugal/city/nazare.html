<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour has all-weather access and very good shelter.</p>
<p>Visitors have a choice of using the marina or yacht club. At the marina (in the SW  corner of the harbour), arriving yachts should berth on the outer pontoons where  they will be met and directed to a berth. Berthing  in the marina is limited.</p>
<p>There is no anchoring in the outer harbour. The harbour is 1.5 miles  south of the town, therefore not that convenient for re-provisioning and supplies.</p>
<p>Port control VHF channel 11 or 16</p>
