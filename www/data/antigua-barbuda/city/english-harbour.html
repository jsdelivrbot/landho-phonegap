<div class="hello"><div><p>English Harbour,<strong> </strong>in the extreme south of the island, takes its name from the nearby harbour in which the British Royal Navy established its base of operations for the area during the 18th century.</p>
<p>It is best known for Nelson's Dockyard with its restored historical buildings and other historical artifacts from the colonial period of the dockyard. In 2016 Nelson's Dockyard became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>English Harbour is a short walk from the neighbouring <a class="external-link" href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda/FalmouthHarbour">Falmouth Harbour.</a></p>
<p>Position 17° 00'24"N, 61° 45'49"W (harbour entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <a href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/Antigua/Formalities</strong></a> page for full details.</p>
<p><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/EnglishHarbour_ESeaClearoffice.jpg/@@images/image/mini"/>Yachts should anchor in the bay (Freeman's Harbour) and hoist the Q flag. The captain only should go ashore to clear. All offices are located in the old Officers' Quarters building. <span>There is an eSeaClear office in the same building, just 2 doors down from Customs and Immigration. If you can't submit notification using your own PC in advance, you can do it here on arrival. There are </span><span>3 workstations and very helpful staff (who belong to the company who wrote the software).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to this office with your eSeaClear reference number and they will <span>print out about 8 pages or so for you to sign, then you process through immigration, customs &amp; park fees with the forms. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Offices are open 0800-1645 daily (Monday to Sunday). After hours, the crew must remain on board until clearance can be completed.</span></p>
<p><span>On departure from English Harbour, harbour fees must be paid at the Paymaster to collect the port clearance certificate. Once registered with eSeaClear <span>outgoing clearance and later re-entry is straightforward.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>English Harbour regulations: The navigation channel from Fort Berkley to the inner harbour must be kept free. One can either anchor off the channel, or come stern to the quay. There is a dinghy speed limit of 4 knots, and all old fuel and oil must be disposed of in the special containers provided.</p>
<p><span>A big new super-yacht dock has been built in Nelson's Dockyard coming out from where the old dinghy dock used to be. The new dinghy dock is behind it. You may no longer anchor on that side of the bay. </span><span>Excellent WiFi available in the anchorage.</span></p>
<p>There are four hurricane chains in the harbour. Ask the Harbour Master at the Dockyard for details and advice.</p>
<p>Park fees are payable when in the harbour.</p>
