<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda?rc=Formalities">Antigua &amp; Barbuda Formalities</a></strong> page.</p>
<p>It is <strong>no longer possible to clear in </strong>to the country here, unless <span>you seek permission from the Customs, 48 hours in advance. <span>Contact email for </span><a href="mailto:customs@ab.gov.ag" target="_blank"><strong>customs@ab.gov.ag</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> <a href="mailto:queenbee.fdr@gmail.com" target="_blank">queenbee.fdr@gmail.com</a> </strong><span>and phone or fax to </span><a href="tel:%281-268-462-2767" target="_blank"><strong>1-268-462-2767</strong></a><span>. Permission has to come from the Comptroller of the day. If   he is not in office, the Acting comptroller will respond to requests. The details required are-: the purpose of visit, the crew list, the details of the vessel- size, class, capacity etc.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to <strong>clear out </strong>from Barbuda, you can either clear out from Antigua and visit Barbuda on departure (but must leave within 24 hours), probably the more straightforward option, or, ring 460 0085 or 725 7933 and ask to clear out at the office in Codrington (advisable to do this from Antigua to be on the safe side).</p>
<p>The difficulty with this is, of course, is that one needs a phone (and coverage in the Spanish Point to Coco Point area is very poor) and <span>g</span><span>etting to the official offices in Codrington involves hiring a taxi or taking the dinghy over 50 meters of sand to the lagoon, then about a 1.5 mile ride to Codrington then a 20 min walk to Customs and Immigration.</span></p>
<p><span>Clearance here can therefore be time consuming as is it a long way to the offices. Plus there are several to visit, and it's highly likely that the officials just don't happen to be there when you make your visit. Alot of patience is required!</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The best anchorages are at Spanish Point and off the west coast.</p>
<p>Cocoa Bay (at the southern end of the island) has been recommended by cruisers as a good anchorage behind a reef. The pass is at an angle and can be tricky however there is a good spot to anchor just off the Cocoa Point Resort.</p>
<p><span>Low Bay is beautiful, but only in settled weather as it does have a tendancy to suffer from swell. </span></p>
<p>Twenty miles north along the coast is the pink sanded "11 Mile Beach" and from here one can visit the mangrove lagoon and the Frigatebird colony (November). Be sure to visit the colony with a local guide as y<span>ou will learn a lot about the island and the local culture. <span> It is forbidden to go by yourself with the dinghy to the sanctuary. </span></span></p>
<p>Palaster Reef is a national park and fishing with a speargun or rod is not permitted.</p>
<p>Charts of Barbuda have been reported as unreliable because of coral growth, especially on the south side of the island.</p>
