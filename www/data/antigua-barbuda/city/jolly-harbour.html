<div class="hello"><div><p>See the main <a href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda?rc=Formalities"><strong>Noonsite/Antigua/Formalities</strong></a> page for full details. The eSeaClear system is in operation here.</p>
<p><span>For some years now, unlike the walk-in customs and immigration procedure in English Harbour, yachts arriving in Antigua at Jolly Harbour were expected to go directly to the wooden dock in front of the yellow customs building for a visual inspection and to clear-in.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>This is no longer neccessary. Skippers can now take their dinghy into Customs from the anchorage, mooring field or marina upon arriving from a foreign port.</span></p>
<p>Customs, Immigration and the Port Authority have their own dock which is situated North of the Superyacht Terminal. The Port Authority dock is marked by a big yellow flag.</p>
<p>Download the official <a href="http://www.jolly-harbour-marina.com/en/marinas-antigua-caribbean/crewlist.doc"><strong>crew list form</strong></a> here.</p>
<p>The offices are open daily (in general) 09:00-16:00, although sometimes the Port Authority is not staffed on weekends and the different authorities tend to open at varying times, which can make clearance time consuming.  Yachts wishing to leave on a weekend should check out on Friday afternoon to avoid departure delays.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/antigua-pics/antigua_jolly-harbour-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>Jolly Harbour <i>(photo courtesy of the marina)</i> contains the most modern marina on the island. It has a dredged approach channel with maximum depth of 3m. <span>At times, the channel may be restricted or closed due to annual maintenance (dredging). See reports and news adjacent for any navigational hazards reported.</span></p>
<p>The marina also provides 12 sheltered moorings just inside the entrance; contact the marina on VHF Ch.68 and proceed to any available mooring. If none are free it is possible to anchor in the same area.</p>
<p>This marina is rather isolated; a 20 minute drive from the capital St. Johns and 30 minutes from the International airport. Whilst provisioning is possible on site, it is cheaper and there is a wider choice if you take the bus or rent a car to visit St. Johns.</p>
