<p>This is not the most convenient place to clear in as it is set up for ships rather than yachts.</p>
<p>The Port Authority is located at the outer end of the peninsula on the north side of the harbour. The dock is usually occupied by commercial vessels but, if space is available, you may stop there <strong>briefly</strong> to clear-in, otherwise anchor off Heritage Quay and use the Customs &amp; Immigration post located nearby. This is not always manned so it may be necessary to walk to the main office on the north side of the harbour about fifteen minutes from Heritage Quay.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The inner harbour between the deep water port and St John's waterfront provides a good anchorage with secure holding in mud for yachts drawing less than 9ft. Ensure you anchor on the 12ft shelf and not in the dredged cruise ship turning circle. No fees are charged for anchoring here.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be left at Treasury Pier and water is available at Keeling Point.</p>
<p>Limited docking and facilities are available at Redcliffe Quay. This is an attractive area of shops and restored historic building, but probably best avoided when a cruise ship is in the harbour.</p>
<p>Groceries and other provisions are readily available in St. Johns and often cheaper than from other parts of the island.</p>
