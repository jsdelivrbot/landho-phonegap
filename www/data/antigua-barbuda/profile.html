<div><ul>
<li>English Harbour is one of the most picturesque harbours in the world with a full range of facilities and marinas. Nelsons Dockyard within English Harbour is now an UNESCO World Heritage Site.</li>
<li>April and May are the busiest time, towards the end of the winter season, when cruising boats arrive on their way home either to Europe or North America, and racing enthusiasts turn up for Antigua Sailing Week held every year at the end of April.</li>
<li>Barbuda is about 30nm north of Antigua, isolated and difficult to navigate. For this reason not many yachts go there, however the magnificent beaches and colonies of Frigate birds are not to be missed.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p>There have been reports of voilent crime against yachties in Antigua over the past few years, with the use of weapons. Whilst these appear to be isolated incidents, visiting cruisers should be careful and avoid walking alone after dark.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/</a></b></p>
