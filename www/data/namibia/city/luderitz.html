<p> </p>
<p>Be aware that on turning east to enter this bay, you are in a wind acceleration zone and the strength of the wind will significantly increase.</p>
<p>However, this is a safe harbour in all weathers and the approaches are well marked.</p>
<p><span>Contact Port Control on arrival on Channel 16. They are open 24/7. They will ask for all the boat and crew details and will assign an anchorage position or mooring buoy.</span></p>
<p>Entry by day should present no problems when arriving at the yacht club, which is at the southeast side of Robert Harbour. At night follow the channel marked by green buoys to starboard and red buoys to port (this will avoid the unlit lighter moorings).</p>
<p>The yacht club may have a mooring available.</p>
<p>There is anchoring room for a few yachts by the Pier and dinghy dock <i>(see photo courtesy of SY Gryphon 2 Jan. 2015)</i>. This is a private pier for which a fee should be paid at the waterfront office - negotiate if the rate seems unreasonable. Water is included in the fee.</p>
<p>Keep clear of the channel if anchoring, or pick up a buoy if one is free. <span>Landing can be made either on the beach or on the robust floating pontoon. Tie to the west side as trip boats occasionally use the east side.</span></p>
<p>It is advisable to rig some bird scarers (plastic bags?) in the riggings as the sea gulls here are particularly messy and cause havoc on the boat is a very short time.</p>
<p>Security all around the harbour is tight due to the proximity of the diamond fields and permits are required for any persons working on the diamond field property (i.e. in the boatyard). This usually means owners are excluded and cannot stay with their boat while in the boatyard.</p>
