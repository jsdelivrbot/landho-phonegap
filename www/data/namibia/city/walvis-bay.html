<div class="hello"><div><p>This is Namibia's principal port and a good place from which to visit the game parks. It lies just over 300nm north of Luderitz. If planning on leaving your boat here to travel the country, note the port regulations and recommendations listed under docking below.</p>
<p>This is also a good spot to do a final provision before crossing the Atlantic for South America/Caribbean.</p>
<p>Do check our <a href="Countries/Namibia"><strong>security section</strong></a> before venturing outside the port.</p>
<p>Note that fog is common here and there is a very large oil rig just off the port entrance.</p>
<p>Location 22° 57’S, 14° 28.6’E.</p></div></div>

      There are two Customs offices near the main entrance gates to the secured port facility.  You want the office WITHOUT a sign.  Go over the railroad tracks and turn left at the next street.  Within a 100m you will find a security post. The Customs office is located here.

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/namibia-pics/walvis-bay-waterfront_sy-gryphon-2/@@images/image/preview"/>The location of the Walvis Bay Yacht club is not readily apparent. The anchorage area is just past the southern end of the commercial harbour <i>(see photo courtesy of SY Gryphon 2 Jan. 2015)</i>.</p>
<p>The anchorage here is now quite restricted due to dredging, although the holding is good. There is also 3m or more depth between Pelican Point and the Yacht Club, so there is no reason to use the dredged channel or get tangled with the commercial shipping.</p>
<p>Be aware that sometime the prevailing wind changes to strong winds from the NE and this creates a significant swell in the anchorage and harbour, with at times, breaking waves.</p>
<p>Harbour regulations require an anchor ball to be displayed and that <span>all yachts must have a watchman on board while anchored. Be sure to appoint a watchman if leaving your boat at anchor here unattended, better still, moor your boat to a tried and tested </span><span>mooring block, to prevent any problems while you are away. The yacht club may have a mooring available, for which there will be a charge.</span></p>
<p><span>The WBYC has a dock that can only be reached by dinghy. Water is available here.</span></p>
<p>It is a long walk both from the town centre and from the yacht club, however the town is safe to walk. Beware of dogs.</p>
<p>Almost everything is available for visiting yachts in Walvis Bay. Repairs are easy to do as there are good mechanics and machine shops with German quality.</p>
<p>Port control will expect you to take the direct route to the anchorage.</p>
<p>The Pelicans and Seals here are king!</p>

      Welcome visiting yachts. Contact in advance for mooring and visitor fees (February 2016 rates posted below in comments). Water is available (but ask which tap!), restaurant and bar, laundry, mail, WiFi and a small dinghy dock. It is a long walk into town from the yacht club, however they will tell you the current taxi rate to town and can arrange transport. <br>
Most repairs can be carried out, but specialised parts may have to be ordered and flown in from South Africa.
