<div><p>International Dialing Code is +691.</p>
<p>Cellphone GSM Frequencies: 900 (This means you will need a GSM cellphone that will work on 900MHz to use it in the Federated States of Micronesia.)</p>
<p>It costs just $10 to get a sim card. If you are not sure your phone will work here, they have a test sim you can try before you buy. Once you have a sim card, you recharge with recharge cards, available from Telecom and most local stores.</p>
<p>Outgoing local cell phone calls are $.15/minute. State-to-state calls are $.50/minute peak and $.30/min off peak. There is no charge for incoming calls.Up to date rate info is here: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.telecom.fm/wireless/rates.htm">http://www.telecom.fm/wireless/rates.htm</a></p>
<div></div>
<p>There is wifi internet access in most of the populated areas in the FSM. Check the nearby resorts. In Pohnpei, the FSMTC signal is available all over town (and in the anchorage). To use these, connect to any FSMTC SSID, make a log-in via your browser, and then use any "recharge card" (the same ones you use for cell phone) to add money to the account. The data rate is pricey, ($.08 per Mb), but it's widely available. Several of the local restaurants and bars also have free wifi for their patrons. (Ocean View, Rusty Anchor, etc).</p>
