            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>The Republic of Cyprus (the southern part of the island of Cyprus), and Larnaca in particular, is a useful stop for long-distance cruising yachts on their way to and from Greece and Turkey.</li>
<li>The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the European Union, but is outside Schengen.</li>
<li>Lacking natural harbours and anchorages, Cyprus has always been an island to visit for its ports, rather than to cruise around. This has been made even more necessary by the ongoing conflict between Cyprus and Turkey (following the latter's occupation of the northern part of the island in 1974) which has reduced the few cruising attractions that the island had in the past. However, the reputation of Cyprus as an excellent base for repairs and reprovisioning has ensured its continuing popularity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fortunately in recent years two new marinas have been developed, Karpaz Gate Marina in the North and Limassol Marina in the South, which means more berths are available. Prices however are higher here for berths than in neighbouring countries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The northern "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" has not been recognised by any other countries except Turkey. The Republic of Cyprus, which controls 60 per cent of the island, is internationally recognised as the government of Cyprus.</li>
