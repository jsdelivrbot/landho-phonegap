Ship's papers will be required by the port authority on arrival. Evidence of insurance may also be requested. A total of five crew lists will be needed.</p>
<p>As soon as you land, you must obtain a Marina pass. Submit two passport size photos to the Marina Office, and write in block letters, behind one of the two photos, your name, surname, passport no., nationality, yacht's name and your profession. Your pass must be left at the marina office on departure, but otherwise it must be carried at all times. Without it you will have difficulty entering and leaving the Marina. Visitors to the boat must also have identification and be met at the gate.</p>
<p>All yachts (EU or not) must clear with Customs.</p>
<p><b>Departure</b></p>
<p>Port Police and Immigration work 24/7 but Customs Office is only staffed 7am to 3pm Monday to Friday. It is possible to clear out them ahead of time is leaving at a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>If Planning to Visit the North</strong><br/> The captains of boats which have stopped in Northern Cyprus are liable to incur heavy penalties and possibly imprisonment. This is because the authorities in the Republic of Cyprus consider it an illegal act to stop in an area of the island, which is under foreign occupation. This is a very serious matter and mariners are therefore advised to avoid at all cost being caught in the politics of the area.</p>
<p>If wishing to visit the south after having cleared out of the north, then it is advisable to visit a Turkish or Greek island first to avoid having any evidence of having been in the north.</p>
