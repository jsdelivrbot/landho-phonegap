<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a sheltered fishing port which may have room for yachts too, but beware that the east of the leading line is very shallow. There is also a submerged breakwater  projecting from that side at the entrance. The maximum depth in the harbour is 2m.</p>
<p>The Harbour Master welcomes yachts and does his best to find a space.</p>
<p>The port generally provides good shelter but can be uncomfortable in strong southerlies.</p>
<p>There is water, electricity and toilets (no showers).</p>
