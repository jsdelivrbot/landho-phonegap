<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is call Kyrenia by Greek Cypriots and Girne by the Turks.</p>
<p>Situated on the north coast of Cyprus, this port has a 6,000 year long history and the remains of countless civilisations. Bounded to the north by the sea and to the south by the greenery of the Besparmak (Fivefinger) Mountain range, it offers the most magnificent scenery on the island.</p>
<p>The beautiful old harbour is dominated by a majestic castle which houses a museum containing the remains of an ancient ship which was salvaged from the sea.</p>
<p>This is a good place to provision.</p>
<p>Position <span>35°20’32"N, 34°19’31"E (old harbour)</span></p></div></div>

      This is in the old harbour and is usually packed. Necessary to call in advance, but it has been reported that berths for visitors are not usually now available. Good holding in  mud.
