<div class="hello"><div><p>The Karpaz peninsula is a stunning, pristine cruising area, only recently opened up after decades of restriction.</p>
<p>Karpaz Gate Marina, located in Yenierenkoy Harbour on the Karpaz peninsula, is halfway along the north coast of the peninsula, making it a very convenient port of call for those cruising the Eastern Mediterranean. It is however quite an isolated spot - see cruisers' reports adjacent.</p>
<p>Position 35°33.5’N, 34°13.6’E. </p>

<p>The new marina opened in June 2011. It is a five star facility part of a resort with a wide range of services and duty free status. It is now full operational and includes a beach club with associated facilities. The staff are reported to be very helpful.</p>
<p>The marina runs a boatyard with a 300 ton travelift for mono and multi-hulls, dry storage and repair services.</p>
<p>Check out their website for frequent special offers. Their 2014 berthing package means you save more if you stay for longer. The marina was awarded 5 Gold Anchors last year.</p>
