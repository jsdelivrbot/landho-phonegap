<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The marina is to the south of the commercial harbour and generally provides good shelter. There are laid lines and services on the pontoons.</span></p>
<p>The outer harbour of the marina is not suitable for berthing and is subject to rough seas with Easterly winds. It is no longer used for that purpose.</p>
<p>Hard standing is on the Western side of the outer harbour.</p>
<p>Larnica is a popular over-wintering stop for many yachts, therefore advance reservations are recommended.</p>
