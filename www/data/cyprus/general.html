<p>Internet available.</p>
<p>Mobile/Cellular Telephone Services</p>
<p>Mobile cellular telephones are available from major retailers and phone shops. If coming to Cyprus with a phone from another country, it may be possible to use it in Cyprus if the frequency band is the same (GSM 900/1800; UMTS 2100). The most economical way to make and receive calls will likely be to purchase a SIM card in Cyprus. All incoming calls are free and local calls are charged at a local rate. </p>
<p>In order to do use a foreign phone in Cyprus, the phone must be "unlocked", meaning it is not tied to a particular provider's network. If the phone is locked, it may be possible to unlock the phone at phone stores in the originating country or in Cyprus. </p>
<p>Once a phone is unlocked, it may be used on any network (provided the phone uses the same technology provided in Cyprus).</p>
<p>Pay-As-You-Go usage means no contract is necessary; users buy pre-paid credits for usage. In order to use the phone on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, make sure the phone is unlocked, purchase a SIM card (a very small replaceable microchip) for a small fee, remove the old SIM card (often underneath the phone battery) and install the new SIM card. The new SIM card packaging will include the new Cyprus phone number. Purchase credit (available in periptero kiosks, tobacconists, post offices and petrol stations) and redeem it with the salesperson (if purchased in a phone store) or via phone call or text message. </p>
<p>There are no roaming agreements with the northern part of Cyprus; Cyprus mobile phones do not work there, however a cellular handset from another country works on both sides of the island. </p>

<p><strong>Turkish Waters and Cyprus Pilot</strong><br/> By Rod and Lucinda Heikell<br/> Publisher: Imray  (9th Edition 2013)<br/> ISBN:  9781846234132<br/> This 9th edition of Rod Heikell's guide to the coast of Turkey from the Bosphorus to the Syrian border and Cyprus has been revised . Since the last edition in 2009, the Turkish coast has changed more than any other in the Mediterranean and in some places beyond recognition. There has been a steady growth in the number of cruising yachts, many of which are now Turkish-owned and to match this facilities have been improved, harbours extended and new marinas built.   This ninth edition has been thoroughly updated and provides the latest information on these developments. The text has been revised and contains new plans and new photographs, many of which are aerial shots.There is no other guide in English and Turkish Waters Pilot sets the standards for both pilotage and describing places to visit and see.</p></div>
