<div><p>To visit any of the islands or to anchor in the territorial seas around the islands of Crozet, Kerguelen and St. Paul and Amsterdam, recreational craft must apply to the prefect, Senior Administrator of TAAF, email <a href="mailto:activites.antarctiques@taaf.fr">activites.antarctiques@taaf.fr</a>.</p>
<p>Any U.K. yachts planning to visit Antartica can apply to the U.K. Foreign Office. Yachts with at least one British national on board are able to apply. This can also be done even if the yacht is not U.K. flagged.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit"><strong>www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit</strong> </a>for more information as well as useful data about sailing in Antartica. The forms are now tailored to expeditions by smaller yachts.<br/>(N<i>ote: this information moved to a new website address in May 2013 and many links from elsewhere are out of date.</i>)</p>
