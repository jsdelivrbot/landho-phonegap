<div><ul>
<li>The most spectacular scenery in the Black Sea and some of the best resorts in the former Soviet Union can now be found in this mountainous country bordering on the eastern shore of the Black Sea.</li>
<li>Ethnic strife and economic problems, which have bedevilled other former Soviet republics, have also left their mark on Georgia. The current travel advice is to avoid South Ossetia and Abkhazia (Oct.2013). There is conflict in these autonomous republics within Georgia as they are seeking greater independence. However, the situation in much of the country has stabilised and the government is making a determined effort to encourage foreign tourism.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Georgia/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Clearance</strong></a> for restrictions on yacht movements.</li>
<li>Both Batumi and Poti are ports of entry, however Poti is a commercial port and has no facilities for yachts. The coastal area south of Poti is considered safe, which is thought by many to be the most beautiful cruising area in the Black Sea.</li>
<li>An expanding local yachting community and regular visits by the Black Sea Yacht Rally (KAYRA) have been accompanied by a gradual improvement of facilities, and while these are still modest by international standards, most emergency repairs can be done locally. For any help it is best to contact the local yacht club in Batumi. There is no longer a yacht club in Poti.</li>
<li>Provisioning is good and very cheap and diesel fuel is available in all ports.</li>
<li>Note that in Georgia it is strictly prohibited to sail less than 6nm from the coast.</li>
<li>Advance help and practical advice for anyone planning to visit any of the Black Sea countries, not just Georgia, is best obtained from Mr Dülger, Assistant Manager at Ataköy Marina near Istanbul. The marina is located close to the southern end of the Bosphorus. Tel. +90 212 560 4270, Fax. 7270, e-mail <a href="mailto:marina@atakoymarina.com.tr">marina@atakoymarina.com.tr</a> </li>
