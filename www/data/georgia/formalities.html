<div><p>Formalities must be completed at a Port of Entry.</p>
<p>At 12 miles off, call the Coast Guard on VHF channel 16. If no reply, call Port Control at 6 miles and reguest entry. Call again at the harbour entrance when the yacht will be advised on where to berth.</p>
<p>Officials are efficient and all will visit the yacht.</p>
<p>On departure from a port, yachts must check-out of the country and clear in again at the next Georgia port. This is done with Port Control - VHF Ch. 16.</p>
<p>Currently there are no clearance charges.</p>
<p>The Georgian Coast Guard does not permit foreign vessels to enter Georgian waters after visiting the disputed region of Abkhazia.</p>
<p>Russia does not permit foreign yachts to visit after having been to Georgia. The converse does not apply.</p>
<p>It is advisable to cross the border into Georgia in international waters i.e. at least 12 miles off-shore. In the past a yacht was confiscated because it crossed close to the coast.</p>
