<div class="hello"><div><p>Batumi sits at the southern end of Georgia's Black Sea Coastline and is the capital of the province of Adjara, the warmest and wettest place in Georgia.</p>
<p>Batumi was under Turkish rule in the 17th Century and famous for its slave market, while in the 19th century it was under Russian rule and a free port. Today, as well as the commercial port area, Batumi has a wide waterfront with beaches, an old town, fading mansions and wooden houses, shady parks and outdoor tea gardens.</p>
<p>The city is currently undergoing a total "facelift" with a tourist influx from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Georgia itself. It is a lively and vibrant place to visit with welcoming locals.</p>
