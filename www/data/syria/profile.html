<ul>
<li>Syria lies on the coast of the Eastern Mediterranean, which used to be called the Levant as the sun rose there. Its capital Damascus is reputed to be the city which has been continually inhabited for the longest period in the world. </li>
<li>The coast lacks natural harbours, and the country is only worth visiting for the ancient sites to be found inland or such medieval landmarks as the Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers.</li>
<li>The situation has improved with the opening of a marina at Lattakia in May 2000, and is a place where the yacht could be left to visit Syria's inland attractions.</li>
