<div><p>Port Control should be contacted prior to arrival on VHF Channel 16. Lattakia is Syria's main port and as its officials are used to dealing with foreign vessels, this is the best port to enter. (Call <code>Lattakia Radio</code>). Call at the 12 mile limit and again at 6 miles off. Approach the port at 90 degrees to the coast.</p>
<p>Since there are specific rules concerning the distance a yacht must stay off the Syrian coast and a yacht's approach to Lattakia Harbour, any yacht wanting to visit there on their own should fax ahead for the latest procedures to the  Syrian Yacht Club.</p>
<p>When 12NM off, call the harbour radio on VHF Channel 16 and follow instructions.</p>
<p>Yachts must have a "clearance document" (zarpe), showing the date of departure from the last marina or port before arrival at Lattakia. Also fax or email copies of passports, ship’s papers and a provisional ETA to the host club or agent at least a week before planned arrival. Visa takes from 3 to 10 days depending on nationality.</p>
<p>It might also be necessary to produce a signed list of your last 5 ports of call and your logbook may be inspected.</p>
<p>Remain on board until the officials have visited the boat and clearance is completed.</p>
<p>Take care to arrive on a weekday as offices are closed on Fridays and Saturdays, as well as on various national holidays.</p>
<p><i>Departure:</i> 24 hours' notice is required before clearing out and once cleared, no one must leave the boat. Again, it needs to be a weekday.</p>

<div><p>passports must be valid for 3 months from entry.</p>
<p>Visas must be obtained in advance from Syrian consulates or embassies abroad. A letter of recommendation from one's own embassy is required if the visa is not obtained in one's country of residence.</p>
<p>Visitors are given a stay of 15 days on arrival but may be able to be extended for up to a month at a time at any immigration office in the major towns or cities. Visas can be difficult to obtain by nationals of certain countries, such as the United States.</p>
<p>Entry is refused to Israeli nationals or to anyone with an Israeli stamp in their passport. Any evidence of a previous visit to Israel is sufficient reason to deny entry, even a stamp from a country with a boarder with Israel.</p>
<p>Visa rules frequently change, so details should be checked before planning a visit.</p>
<p>Visitors must change US$100 on arrival.</p>
