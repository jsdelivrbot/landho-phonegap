<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the principle port for yachts entering Syria. </p>
<p>Contact <code>Lattakia Radio</code> on VHF channel 16 when at the reporting point, <code>Sierra Charlie</code>, twelve miles true west of the Syrian coast. Do not take any short cuts, as Syrian Navy patrol boats monitor the corridor and will readily impose a $4,000 fine for any infringements. Follow the instructions given.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Syria/?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Syria Clearance page</a> for more details.</p>
<p>All crew must remain on board until clearance is completed.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is to the north of the main commercial harbour, and can be approached directly from the reporting point. Aim for the conspicuous, eight storey blue and white building block. The entrance is tucked away just north of it. Once inside the breakwater aim for the northern quay.</p>
<p>The Yacht Club marina is in the NE corner of the fishing port (Nadir Yakut). </p>
<p>Beware of the various loose mooring lines floating around the harbour.</p>
<p>Mooring fees tend to be much higher than average for the Mediterranean.</p>
