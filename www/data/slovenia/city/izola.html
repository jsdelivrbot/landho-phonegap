<div class="hello"><div><p>This town lies midway between Piran and Koper, both of which are only about 3NM away. <span>Whilst the old town of Izola is not as attractive as those of Koper or Piran, it does share some of their charm with its share of narrow lanes and picturesque houses with red-tiled roofs.</span></p>
<p>It is a very popular tourist resort and has a large modern marina and boatyard.</p>
<p>Position 45°32.3'N, 13°39.6'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is in the southern corner of the old harbour, which lies south of the old town. Entry is through <span>a 75m-wide channel between two long breakwaters. </span></p>
<p><span>The eastern half of the harbour is occupied by small craft moorings and pontoon berths; the western half has pontoons for larger vessels.</span></p>
<p>The marina offers good shelter, although strong northerlies can create a surge in the harbour which can be problematic for those berthed on the outside.</p>
