<div class="hello"><div><p>Piran is the most convenient port of entry if coming from either Venice or Croatia. It is an attractive old town with a strong Venetian flavour and yachts moor right in the centre of the main square, which is a delight. That said, it gets busy in high season.</p>
<p>Position 45°31.5'N, 13°34.1'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a small space next to the fuel dock one can tie to for clearance. The Harbourmaster's office is at the root of the short breakwater and the Customs and Immigration are near the floating pontoon.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The small harbour lies on the SE side of the peninsula and is entered from SSW through a narrow entrance.</span></p>
<p><span>There is space to berth around 20-30 yachts up to 20m in length along its western breakwater in depths of 5-6m. Berth stern or bow-to with lazy lines. <span>The berths on the eastern side of the harbour are for local yachts only. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span>Water and fuel are available in the harbour, but there are no other services for yachts.</span></p>
<p>Finding a berth here is not always easy, especially in the height of the season.</p>
<p><span>Whilst s</span><span>helter is good, strong SW'lies can send a surge into the harbour so it i</span><span>s best visited in settled conditions.</span></p>
