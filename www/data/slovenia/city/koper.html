<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two harbours here. The old harbour (to the west of the town) is the one used by yachts, the other being the commercial port.</p>
<p><b>Old Harbour</b></p>
<p><span>Although sheltered, a surge can enter the old harbour in strong winds from the west, southwest and northwest. <span>There are stern-to berths on the pier on the northern side of the old harbour, but watch the depth.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>It is also possible to anchor south of the short pier in the old harbour, but this is rather exposed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Marina</b></span></span></p>
<p>There is also a marina to the north of the centre of the old city.</p>
<p>When approaching the marina, beware of the swimming area to sta'bd (marked by buoys) close by the entrance.</p>
