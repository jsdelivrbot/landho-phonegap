<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a holiday town close to the border with Croatia. Whilst the town itself is nothing special, there are good marina and repair facilities here. In fact Marina Portoroz was the first marina built in Slovenia back in 1974. It is very large, with more than 1000 berths.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina for visiting yachts is to sta'bd as you come through the entrance. Not an easy place for a multihull to fit in. Berthing is stern-to with a pile for the bow-line set off the dock. Careful manoevuring is required.</p>
<p>Anchoring is not permitted here.</p>
<p>This is a well-sheltered spot and a safe place to leave a boat during the winter.</p>
