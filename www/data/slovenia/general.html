<p><strong>777 Harbours and Anchorages - Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Albania</strong><br/> By Anna and Rod Bailey<br/> Publisher: Edizioni Magnamare<br/> ISBN 978 8862000123<br/> 777 contains detailed, up-to-date information on more than 1000 ports and anchorages, as well as the technical details which are of most interest to pleasure yachters: the phone numbers of the Marinas and Harbourmaster's offices, the facilities available, mooring facilities, where to buy provisions. Besides the main harbours, there are charts showing solitary, nearly unknown coves; this result was achieved thanks to the patience and precision of the author. Slso contains a few hints and coves which were added to the original book, thanks to the contributions by editors, Piero and Silvia Magnabosco</p>
