<div><p>There are no formalities for EU registered boats with only EU citizens on board arriving from an EU country.</p>
<p>If arriving from outside the EU, fly the <code>Q</code> flag when 12 miles off shore.</p>
<p>If required to report on arrival, enter at one of the official Ports of Entry. Wait for the officials to come to the yacht for clearance. In marinas, the staff will call the relevant officials.</p>
<p>If no official arrives, the captain should report to the police for passport control, as well as Customs and Harbour Master. The crew must remain on board until formalities are completed.</p>
