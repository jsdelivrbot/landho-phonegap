<li>Situated between Italy and Croatia, Slovenia has a small stretch of coast on the Istrian peninsula. The area has been hardly affected by the war in the south and boats have continued to cruise here throughout the hostilities in neighbouring Croatia.</li>
<li>Slovenia became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004.</li>
<li>Although lacking the range of yachting facilities available along the Croatian coast, Slovenia's few ports and marinas are well equipped and most ports are attractive old towns.</li>
<li>Izola and Koper have good yard and repair facilities.</li>
