<div><p><strong>Telephones</strong><br/> International dialing code for South Africa is +27.</p>
<p>South Africa has an extensive GSM network. There are five cell phone providers in South Africa: Vodacom, MTN, Cell-C, Virgin Mobile and 8ta.</p>
<p>The networks support GPRS countrywide and 3G, EDGE and HSDPA support is available in larger urban areas.</p>
<p>SIM card prepaid starter kits are available. You will need a passport and a proof of residential address and it has to be registered before you can call or receive calls. A letter from the police saying the marina is your place of residence will suffice. If you call into a Vodacom or MTN store with a passport and drivers licence, you can be all connected on the spot. You can buy credit for prepaid phones just about everywhere, remembering you will usually need cash to do so from service stations.</p>
<p><strong>Internet</strong><br/> There are plenty of Internet Cafes and access rates are cheap. Alternatively you can buy a dongle for your computer and access the internet through mobile phone networks.</p>
<p><strong>SSB Nets</strong><br/>The waters around SA are tough sailing after the tropics and with daily weather updates and local knowledge it can be made much more fun. Go <strong><a class="external-link" href="Members/doina/R2004-12-08-2">here</a></strong> for a list of SA SSB nets.</p></div>
