<div class="hello"><div><p>St Helen Bay is a large bay in the Western Cape, is about 80nm north of Cape Town and is about 35nm north of Saldanha Bay. The Sandy Bay harbour is round Shelly Point and faces east.</p>
<p>Eight miles further to the east, is the Berg River which leads to the sheltered Port Owen and is probably the best spot on the South African coast to spend the winter months. It makes an ideal departure port from SA..</p>
<p>Location 32°44.5'S, 18°01.2' E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Sandy Point Harbour is open to the east but provides a sheltered anchorage in winds from other directions. There is good holding in sand just south of the fish factory.</p>
<p>If more protection is required, the marina at Port Owen offeres complete shelter. There is a bar at the river entrance which breaks in strong NW winds. It is advisable to enter about half tide as LAT is only 1.5m. The marina is just over 1.5 miles from the river entrance.</p>
<p>There is a "holding jetty" on the port side shore at the river entrance and is clearly marked. For visiting yachts wanting to proceed further up-river and into the Marina it is advisable to contact the Marina office. Yachts doing this trip must just follow the line of centre channel marker buoys to the Marina entrance.</p>
<p>The Port Owen Yacht Club welcomes visiting and cruising yachts.</p>
<p>There is a <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica/StHelnaBayPortOwen?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">boatyard</a></strong> here with a crane for up to 10 tons. They can provide general repair services, antifouling etc. and long term storage.</p>
