<div class="hello"><div><p>Tucked into the south western corner of the southern tip of South Africa, Cape Town is an obvious port of call for many yachts rounding the Cape of Good Hope.</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica?rc=Formalities">South Africa Formalities</a></b><span>, for full details on clearing into and out of South Africa.</span></p>
<p><strong>Entering</strong><br/> All yachts entering the port must listen out on VHF channel 14 and proceed to the small craft basin at the Royal Cape Yacht Club.</p>
<p>Approaching the harbour, yachts  should stay east of the buoys, entering close to the east mole and remain that side of the harbour. This applies also when entering the Duncan Dock. The yacht basin and yacht club are located at the SE end of Duncan Dock.</p>
<p>The Royal Cape Yacht Club deals with all yacht movement within Table Bay Harbour, so they must be contacted first on VHF Channel 16 (tel 021 421 1354 or fax 021 421 6028), and <strong>not</strong> the port authority.</p>
<p>The movement of shipping around the harbour is indicated by lights on the port captain's office, red (Ben Schoeman Dock), green (Duncan Dock) and orange (Victoria Basin). A flashing light signifies a ship is entering port and a steady light that one is leaving.</p>
<p><span>If a yacht is booked in at the V&amp;A Waterfront Marina, it should stay the breakwater side and ask for permission to enter on VHF channel 14. This marina is nearer the city centre, at the eastern end of the port.</span></p>
<p><strong>Formalities</strong></p>
<p><span>The</span><span> Royal Cape Town Yacht Club is the only place where outward clearance is permitted. If berthed at the V&amp;A marina, yachts must proceed to the RCYC for outward clearance. It is essential to have a form from the yacht club stating that all debts have been paid. Currently, this can </span><strong>only</strong><span> be produced by the RCYC and not the V&amp;A marina.</span></p>
<p><span>The RCYC has two berths specifically for yachts undergoing clearance (stay limited to 24 hours maximum), but will make every effort to accommodate more, if necessary. Club staff are reported to be very helpful. It is </span><strong>essential</strong><span> to contact the club in advance.</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst the RCYC do now have a credit card machine, be aware that is not always working, in which case payment must be in cash (a long walk to the ATM in town!). Be sure to check out the payment situation prior to departure.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Arrival</strong></span></p>
<p>The captain must first report to the marina or yacht club, complete a maritime and health form, (clearance certificate) and then clear with Immigration and Customs.</p>
<p>Note that Immigration requires that you bring your whole crew. Both Customs and Immigration are open 24 hrs/day.</p>
<p>Immigration (Passport Control) is now located on the <span>Ground Floor, Cowrie Place, near EBerth (former TPT Building).</span> Open 24/7.</p>
<p><span>Take ships papers, passports for all the crew and clearance papers from the last port. and the clearance certificate issued by the RCYC or marina.</span></p>
<p>Then visit the Harbour Revenue Office at Ben Schoeman Dock, followed by the Customs office by the main Gate.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>Currently departure can only be made from the RCYC marina.</p>
<p>When departing, first obtain the clearance certificates for "Port Net", Immigration and Customs, who must be visited in that order. After clearance, one must leave within 48 hours.</p>
<p>If leaving for another South African port, lodge an <span>itinerary </span><span>with the Port Authority (time of departure, intended destination, and ETA) and clearance obtained from the yacht club or marina you are in.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>In Cape Town you currently have the choice between the Royal Cape Yacht Club in the south-eastern part of the commercial harbour or the marina in the "Waterfront", also called V&amp;A, Cape Town's favourite tourist centre on the eastern end of the port.</p>
<p>The Yacht Club caters still for most of the visiting yachts. A professionally managed, large marina with almost all facilities, but 5 minutes away from the city and the V&amp;A by car. It also is squeezed in between the industrial parts of the commercial harbour.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A can also be noisy with the motorway nearby, but is very close to a large number of shops, bars, cinemas, the aquarium and much more. It is necessary to call the bridge control to arrange access into the marina.</p>
<p>The harbour is not very clean and the winds often blow at 40 to 50kn.</p>
<p><strong>Entry Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Small craft are reminded not to impede commercial vessels entering or leaving this busy port. The port signals displayed on the Port Control Building indicate the basin operating and the action taking place. Craft should call "Port Control" as above if intending to cross or enter a channel. Lightsa are shown from the port control tower and operate at all times as follows:- Ben Schoeman Dock - Red Duncan Dock - Green Victoria Basin - Amber Flashing light - Vessel entering Fixed light - Vessel leaving (no entry)</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring and Berthing</strong></p>
<p>Anchoring is forbidden within "any channel of the harbour".</p>
<p>The RCYC visitors' berths are the first two berths inside the first pontoon. <span>It is advisable to phone the marina manager shortly before arriving. Emails do not always get answered.</span></p>
<p><span>In the V &amp; A there are alongside and stern-to berths.</span></p>
