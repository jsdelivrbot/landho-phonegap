<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated midway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, it lies around the wide and spectacular lagoon at the mouth of the Knysna River. Holiday houses line the shore and this is a designated nature reserve alive with birds and wildlife.</p>
<p>Whilst not the easiest place to get into, cruisers report that it is well worth the effort and very sheltered once inside. An excellent calm spot to wait for a weather window to Cape Town.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts must have an up to date chart and be sure to time their entry carefully into the narrow entrance (slack tide and a favorable lack of southerly swell). Only suitable for boats that draw less than approx. 7ft. A  webcam on the entrance allows remote viewing of the swell conditions.  Not an entrance to try if the swells are breaking, or if the tide is ebbing against a significant swell.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The telephone number for the Knysna Harbour Master </span><span>for assistance (044) 3820955 (South African international dialling code is +27). ie: <a href="tel:%2B27443820955" target="_blank">+27443820955</a> when dialling from outside South Africa.</span></p>
<p>It is important to get advice on whether it is safe to enter if there is any amount of swell running.</p>
<p><span>The local NSRI (National Sea Rescue Institute) Station 12 will gladly supply visiting yachts with real time information. They can be contacted via telephone on 044 384 0211 or cell phone 083 324 6558.</span></p>
<p><span><span>There is no radio base station in operation although local yachts use VHF channel 10 for communications.The Knysna Yacht Club will be happy to assist if they are at their radio station at the time visiting yachtsmen call on the radio.</span></span></p>
<p>Yachts can either take a guest mooring at the yacht club, or anchor out mid-lagoon. It's possible the Parks Department may make a small charge to anchor ($15 per month).</p>
<p>Several yachts have wintered here in recent times and report that onshore there are a variety of restaurants, shops, hotels, grocery stores, produce markets, etc., as well as a cinema, all within walking distance from the marina.</p>
<p>There are limited repair facilities at the Yacht Club and a home-orientated hardware store at Games.</p>

      Guest moorings available (check beforehand), 7 days free offered to foreign cruising yachts (2010). The tide is about 2m, but the marina moorings float; there's also usually room at the wall, but you'd have to deal with the rise/fall of the tide. Very protected in terms of swell. Halout facility available inc. catamarans up to approx. 7.5m beam plus some repair facilities. Book in advance.
