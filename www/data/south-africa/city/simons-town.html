<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../south-africa-pics/Simonstown_town_SYFlow.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Simon's Town is located on the NW side of False Bay, some 15 miles North of the Cape of Good Hope (<i>photo by SY Flow)</i>.</p>
<p>It was once used by the Dutch fleet to hide here from the fierce Westerlies, especially from March to October. When the steamships later on needed a shore base, the harbour was extended to cater for those needs and today it is the base for the South African Navy and some 200 pleasure craft.</p>
<p>Simon's Town is a good alternative for those preferring to be away from busy Cape Town, and who don't mind travelling an hour by car to get to the main city. It also is a good option for haulout.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina, hiding behind substantial wave breakers on the north side of the Navy base, is not yet marked on all international charts, but the approach is easy and well lit. Beware of "Roman Rocks", about 1 mile NE of the main harbour.</p>

<p>Only in strong SE conditions some surge is experienced, otherwise the marina is well sheltered. Boats larger than 52 feet must book prior to arrival as there are very few spaces available to them. As this is becoming a popular spot for visiting yachts in general, booking in advance might be advisable for other boats also.</p>
<p>Temporary Visitor Membership fees are payable to the False Bay Yacht Club by any visitor who has a boat temporarily moored in FBYC waters in Simon's Bay.</p>
<p>Post office, shops, hardware, LPG, medical facilities and all other services are found in the shopping street. There are a great number of restaurants for all tastes very near the town and the port is reasonably safe even after dark and there are many security guards on duty.</p>
<p>Most of the tradespeople can be found here and those coming from Cape Town visit Simonstown on request.</p>
