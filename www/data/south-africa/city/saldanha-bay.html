<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a busy commercial harbour about 60NM north of Cape Town and a major port for exporting iron. It is adjacent to the West Coast National Park. The breakwater and hills here have created a very sheltered harbour in the NW of the port for fishing boats and yachts.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As there is no Immigration office here, clearance for <b>yachts</b> cannot be completed here. Although Customs has the authority to deal with cruise ships, the immigration procedures for yachts has to be done in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The port captain should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 for permission to enter and leave the harbour, as well as when crossing the shipping channel between Saldanha and Langebaan. </p>
<p>The port captain should also be notified if clearance is required on arrival. He will advise on the procedures but it is likely that Customs officers will meet the yacht at the yacht club, which is located to the north-west of the bay, north of President Jetty. The Customs office is just inside the gate on
the Iron Ore Dock.</p>
<p>Immigration clearance willl require a trip to Cape Town.</p>
