<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica?rc=Formalities">South Africa Formalities</a></b><span>, for full details on clearing into and out of South Africa.</span></p>
<p>Durban Harbour Radio (the Signal tower that controls shipping movements into and out of the harbour) must be contacted approx. 1 mile off on VHF channel 09, to inform the authorities in advance of the yacht's arrival and to request permission to proceed through the entrance channel. Foreign yachts may be met by a Police Coast Patrol which will escort the yacht to a holding area, or alternatively Durban Harbour Radio may advise to proceed to the International Jetty or Small Craft Basin.</p>
<p>Arriving yachts have to contact the following departments within 24 hours of arrival: Customs, Immigration, Health, and  Portnet Office. These offices must also be visited when leaving. Note a<span style="text-align: justify; ">ll International visitors must report to Durban Immigrations, irrespective of whether they have cleared into South Africa already. </span>Durban Marina can help arrange clearance.</p>
<p>If leaving for another South African port, lodge an itinerary (flight plan) with the Port Authority (time of departure, intended destination, and ETA) and clearance obtained from the yacht club or marina you are in.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><span style="text-align: justify; "> The Port Authority office is NOT open on weekends and Public Holidays, therefore clearing out should be done on the Friday morning prior to leaving.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is approached via a narrow channel, and this protects it from prevailing NE and SW winds, both of which can blow with considerable force.</p>
<p>Docking is available at Durban Marina or on moorings at the smaller Bluff Yacht Club, 5nm from the harbour entrance. The Royal Natal Yacht Club and the Point Yacht Club, based at the Durban Marina, no longer have berthing facilities available but there is an anchorage in front.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in the Silburn Channel, where the holding is reasonably good. Fore and aft anchors are required and care should be taken not to obstruct the channel.</p>
