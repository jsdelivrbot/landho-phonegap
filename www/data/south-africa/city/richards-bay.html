<div class="hello"><div><p>Richards Bay is a large natural harbour on South Africa's eastern coast, about 90NM NE of Durban. Although is is a large commercial port, it is a pleasent port of call for yachts. </p>
<p>Position 28° 48' 17" S,32°3' 35" E.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica?rc=Formalities">South Africa Formalities</a></strong><span>, for full details on clearing into and out of South Africa.</span></p>
<p>Contact Richards Bay Port Authority on VHF channel 16 or 12 before entering the harbour entrance. You will be informed to either stand-off or enter. Although you may not get an aswer at all.</p>
<p>If arriving from a foreign port all yachts must first proceed to the Small Craft Harbour and await clearance at the Quarantine Jetty, although at busy times you may be directed elsewhere. After clearance you may proceed to Tuzi Gazi Marina or Zululand Yacht Club.</p>
<p>The Port Authorities should have instructed Customs, Immigration and Health of your arrival and they may come to your boat. Customs no longer visit yachts and you will have to visit their office.  If there is a delay with Immigration arriving, calling Port Authorities on the radio and informing them may help hurry the procedure. After Immigration and Health you then have to visit Customs yourself.</p>
<p>Cruisers have reported clearance taking a long time (up to 8 days), however it may be possible to move to one of the marinas if this is the case, and complete clearance from there and visit all the offices yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Checking Out</strong></p>
<p>Checking out is not simple and you need a car or taxi to visit the various offices which are spread out.  You pay your berthing fees and obtain a form from the Port  Captain's office at the small craft harbour (or from the marina office) who will then add the first stamp required. Then visit first Immigration then Customs (see addresses below). With your paperwork completed, you go to Water Police/Port Captain's office and obtain another stamp. If you are berthed at the marina or YC return there and if all is complete, they will fax your "flight plan" to Port Control. Once approved, your final clearance is faxed back. Note - it might be quicker to take all the completed and stamped forms to the Port Office yourself.</p>
<p>You have 36 hours to leave once you have checked out.  If you do not check out in this time you have to to check back in and then check out again.</p>
<p>Applications for visitor visa extensions can be made at the Home Affairs office beside the Boardwalk Mall. Extensive paperwork is required and a fee is charged before your application will be accepted. Cruisers report that results of applications can vary widely, from not getting an extension until well after the previous visa has expired, to getting an extension from date of application (thus negating any time left on the first visa).</p>

      Tuzi Gazi marina, situated in the Small Craft Harbour, suffered badly during a storm in November 2015 when the pontoons buckled. Maintenance here is poor and this marina is not ideal for larger yachts in particular. Offers showers, water, security, bottle store, café, chandlery. Carpenters and stainless steel manufacturer on-site.

      The club offers all facilities like hot showers, laundry, bar, restaurant and swimming pool. The first two weeks of staying are free of charge and thereafter temporary memberships must be taken out at a reasonable price. Although the premises are a bit off track, club members always try to assist visiting yachts by giving them lifts to shopping areas. The walk-on jetties  and the wall where yachts larger than 50 feet are accommodated have electricity and water available. There is a well stocked chandlery. The boat yard has an interesting type of travel lift and long term hard stand storage. The jack stands are just logs but seem to work well The Club has 24 hour security and is considered safe. Every Monday evening there is a "bring and braai" (barbeque) and bar happy hours take place on Wednesday evenings.
