<div class="hello"><div><p>Hout Bay is surrounded by spectacular mountains and sports a picturesque harbour for a small fishing fleet. It lies on the western coast of the Cape Peninsula, 15NM south of Cape Town harbour. </p>
<p>Contrary to information previously posted here, where it was reported this bay was very sheltered, it should be noted that Hout Bay does suffer from very strong Katabatic winds from the East, kicking up waves and spray. Visiting yachts should be sure to find as protected a berth as possible in the marina to avoid problems when the Katabatics strike. </p>
<p>Position 34°03.07'S, 18°20.98'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If you moor at Simonstown or Hout Bay you will have to complete clearance in Cape Town taking your whole crew with you.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/SouthAfrica/CapeTown"><b>Cape Town Clearance</b></a> for details,</p>
<p>All yachts must sign their craft in and out in the yacht club register at the Marina.</p>
<p>When departing from South Africa for a foreign destination skippers must obtain<span> a clearance certificate from the yacht club to show all fees have been paid and visit the necessary officials in Cape Town (Immigration, Harbour Revenue Office and Customs). </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a marina with about 100 walk on moorings (floating pontoons) and the pontoons for the ABC boat Club. The extended harbour wall protects the marina from any surge.</p>
<p>In the little town just 10 minutes walk from the port you find laundry services, rental cars, hardware shops, tool hire, spare parts, supermarkets, pharmacy and a great number of restaurants. </p>
<p>The town and port is reasonably safe even after dark and there are many security guards watching this upmarket tourist place and the pretty homes.</p>
<p>Tradesmen will visit here from Cape Town.</p>
