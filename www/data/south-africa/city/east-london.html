<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica?rc=Formalities">South Africa Formalities</a></strong>, for full details on clearing into and out of South Africa.</p>
<p>The approach is very easy and straightforward even in heavy weather or at night. Call East London "Port Control" some 2 hours prior to arrival and once more when you are 1 mile off the breakwater. Don't pass too close to the breakwater.</p>
<p>On departure for international waters, clear first with the yacht club in order to get clearance certificates for "Port Net", Immigration and Customs, who must be visited in that order. After clearance, one must leave within 48 hours.</p>
<p>If leaving for another South African port, lodge an itinery with the Port Authority (time of departure, intended destination, and ETA) and the clearance obtained from the yacht club.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Proceed all the way in to just before the railway bridge and find a free visitors space on the Yacht Club pontoons. <span>Althernatively, there is plenty of room to anchor next to the Club.</span></p>
<p>Only very little surge enters the harbour so far up and a slight current will be experienced depending on the tide, but beware if there is any amount of rain as the stream in the river can then be strong enough to cause dragging.</p>
<p>The harbour is safe to enter even in strong winds and provides good shelter in all wind directions.</p>
