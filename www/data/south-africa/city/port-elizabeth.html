<div class="hello"><div><p>This large commercial port lies on Algoa Bay, on the eastern end of South Africa's southern coast. It is an industrial city which covers both banks of the Baakens River.</p>
<p>The general safety rule is when you exit the Port on foot, turn left. The MBDA is upgrading the area and a very visible police force is currently on the ground if you do turn right.</p>
<p>Port Elizabeth has an Uber Service (book services via your mobile phone).</p>
<p>Position 33° 57.4' S, 25° 38.1' E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can anchor opposite the Shark Rock pier, which is to the south west of the harbour. When anchoring here beware of <span>Devil's Reef which lies approx. 500m from the end of the pier in a direct line bearing SSW to Shark Rock. It is not chartered on most charts. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The wind in the harbour normally turns North at about 02h00.</span></p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="Countries/south-africa-pics/south-africa_port-elizabeth_iron-ore/@@images/image/preview"/>Marina</strong></p>
<p>Yachts usually berth at the ABYC (see details below) in the SW corner of the harbour, just North of the Oil Tanks and West North West of the Iron Ore Depot.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if Iron Ore (dry dust) is being loaded at the Depot and there is a strong easterly wind, black dust can be a problem in the marina and surrounding area and cover decks and deck equipment <i>(photo courtesy of SY Pipistrelle who visited in December 2015)</i>. Speak with the Club on arrival to check the current situation. Berths on the eastern side of the marina are more sheltered from this problem, and from the swell which can also be quite prevalent here.</p>
<p><span>The Port Authorities have a public plan in place for the Iron Ore Depot to be moved across Algoa Bay to a more modern and environmentally friendly facility in the Port of Nqura - building of which has already commenced and is estimated to open in February 2019.</span></p>
<p>The marina here was destroyed by an 80 knot "breeze" in late 2009 and the Yacht Club have been rebuilding it ever since.</p>
<p>Prior notification of arrival is appreciated by calling either the ABYC or the Marina Manager. Boats up to 45ft can easily be accommodated, but if you are larger than this available space would need to be discussed in advance.</p>
<p>In addition to berthing fees, there is a charge per crew member for use of the yacht club facilities ashore. Marina fees can only be paid in cash.</p>
