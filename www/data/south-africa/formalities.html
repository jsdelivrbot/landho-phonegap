<div><p>Entry to South Africa can <strong>only</strong> be made at one of the Ports of Entry.</p>
<p><span>The Q flag must be flown.</span></p>
<p>On approaching a port, call the Port Authorities on VHF channel 12 or 16. Do not be surprised if you fail to get a response. Although  all the required officials  are expected to visit the boat, it is much more likely that you will need to visit all the offices yourself. A local taxi can help you do this. This will avoid a possible fine for clearing in more than 24 hours after arrival.</p>
<p>Inward clearance must be made with the Port Authority/Harbour Police, Immigration and Customs.</p>
<p>Cape Town and Richards Bay are the best ports for clearing into the country as they have more experience in handling foreign yachts.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>Before departure, a letter or form must be obtained from each of the marinas or yacht clubs you have visited stating that all dues have been paid. This is required before completing departure clearance with Customs and Immigration.</p>
<p>When moving to another South African port, a cruising itinerary (time of departure, intended destination, and ETA) must be lodged with the Port Authority. This only applies if leaving a Port of Entry.</p>
<p>The rules applicable for the entry and exit clearance procedures in South Africa are changeable.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid at least six months beyond arrival in the country.</p>
<p>Most nationalities do not require visas and a <strong>90 day stay</strong> is normally granted on arrival.  See note on visa extensions below.</p>
<p>For an up to date list of countries exempt from South African visas see: <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries">http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries</a></strong></p>
<p>Obtaining a multi-entry visa <strong>before</strong> arriving will make it simpler for you to leave the yacht and fly home before returning.</p>
<p>There are South African embassies in Port Louis (Mauritius) and St Denis (Réunion). The rules on needing a face to face interview and having biometric data recorded when obtaining a visa are being eased (Nov 2015) and the biometric data is to be collected on entry to South Africa. Check with the nearest embassy if this will apply to you.</p>
<p>Passports are not normally stamped on arrival. If wishing to leave a yacht and travel within South Africa, it is essential to get the passport stamped.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter the country by yacht, and leave by another means and then return, you will not re-start the visa clock. Therefore on return, you will still only have 90 days from your original entry left to stay in SA, unless you have a multi-entry visa.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to get a Temporary Residence Permit (TRP) as owner of a yacht by proving ownership, and as crew by possessing an air ticket home or equivalent funds.</p>
<p>Any crew leaving the country by other means than by yacht must inform Immigration and must possess a valid air ticket to their own country or equivalent funds. Immigration must also be notified if a South African national joins the yacht for a cruise while in South African waters.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Extensions</strong></p>
<p><span>All immigration approvals are now run from Pretoria, so extensions beyond an additional 3 months are highly unlikely.</span></p>
<p>Extensive paperwork is required for an extension and a fee is charged before your application will be accepted. <span>The official </span><span>requirement is to apply well in advance, but the practice is that those who </span><span>do often lose a month or more from their original visa as the new one </span><span>applies immediately. Many people find themselves travelling and are only </span><span>able to apply for an extension a week or so before it expires.</span></p>
<p>Cruisers report that results of applications can vary widely, from not getting an extension until well after the previous visa has expired, to getting an extension from date of application (thus negating any time left on the first visa).</p>
<p>It is therefore advisable to secure your visa extension first before purchasing flights out of South Africa as changing flight dates can be very expensive.</p>
<p><span> Another perfectly acceptable method of extending your stay in South Africa is to pay </span><span>a visit to Zimbabwe, Botswana or Namibia just before the visa expires. This </span><span>will enable you to obtain a new 3 month visa when you return to South </span><span>Africa.</span><span> Travelling to Swaziland or Lesotho won't work.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>Length of Stay</strong></p>
<p><span>It has been confirmed by Cape Town Customs that visiting foreign yachts can stay in South Africa indefinitely and no Duties and VAT will become liable.</span></p>
<p><span>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica/time-allowed-before-duty-and-vat-is-attached-to-foreign-flagged-pleasure-vessels-staying-in-south-africa/">this report</a></strong> for more details (July 2015).</span></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><strong>Between September 2012/2013</strong><strong> </strong><span>Customs in </span><i>Richards Bay, Durban, Port Owen and Suldana</i><span> started enforcing a 6 month time limit for visiting foreign yachts, and charging large fines to many foreign cruisers. In actual fact this 6 month limit is supposed to only apply to </span><i>commercial</i><span> vessels, and SARS ruled on 3 September 2013 that the attachment of any yachts would be stopped and all yacht owners who had paid fines were entitled to a full refund. See </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SouthAfrica/south-africa-yacht-owners-who-have-paid-customs-fines-can-claim-a-full-refund"><strong>news article</strong></a><span> for full details.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Customs Rules</strong></span></p>
<p>All sealable goods must be declared. This includes all tobacco, spirits, drugs, etc.</p>
<p>Firearms will be sealed by Customs on board if this is possible. Otherwise firearms will be removed and bonded until departure.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts <strong>should</strong> be able to obtain a tax refund on goods bought in South Africa in the 3 months prior to leaving. <i>(see comment below.) </i>An original VAT invoice should be requested when purchasing such goods. Customs should be then contacted for the necessary formalities. Yachts in transit may be able to buy yacht equipment VAT free.</p>
<p><span>To get goods with a value over R500 out of Customs you need a clearing agent. Be careful as agent fees can vary widely. Be sure to ask around and get some quotes before appointing an agent. Find out if they deliver to your marina.</span></p>
<p><span>The postal and delivery services can be very unreliable. It is advisable, if possible, not to expect a delivery to arrive before you need to leave.</span></p>
