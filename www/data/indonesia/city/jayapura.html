<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Jayapura_SVTotem.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Papua's original capital and busiest sea port, Jayapura is situated on Papua's  Northern coast, close to the boarder with Papua new Guinea. It is Papua's largest city.</p>
<p><i>Photo from <strong><i> <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com">sv-totem.blogspot.com</a></strong></i></strong> (December 2012).</i></p>
<p>The nearby town of Sentani is the hub of air transport both to and around Papua,  however international travel to this region is almost non-existent. The area  around Jayapura and Sentani has a lot to offer, including scenic bays with good  beaches, a huge freshwater lake with islands big enough to support villages plus a  healthy tradition of woodcarving and painted bark-cloth manufacturing.</p>
<p>Jayapura port itself however is very polluted.</p>
<p><span>The entrance to Jayapura has a number of floating devices moored outside at a distance of several miles, and they have no lights. It is recommended to enter and leave during daylight.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a PNG consulate in Jayapura.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is an official Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><strong><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from </span></strong></span><span><strong><span>the 27th February, 2016</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></strong><span><span> </span></span><span>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers is no longer required. See<span> </span><a href="../KaiIslands/"><span><strong><span><strong>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</strong></span></strong></span></a><span> </span>for full details.</span></p>
<p><strong>CLEARING IN</strong></p>
<p>Authorities are reported to be friendly and helpful here. <span>The police dock is the closest point to moor your dinghy for all offices. Watch out for low tide and moor your dinghy on the outside of the dock.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you arrive needing cash, walk up to the street from the Police dock and turn right. Less than fifty metres along is the closest ATM.</span></span></p>
<p><span>All the offices are in different parts of town. Use the “</span><i>taksi</i><span>” service (a shared minivan used for public transportation) which is cheap - about US$0.20 - for a ride across town.</span></p>
<p><span>Don't forget your boat stamp (if you don't have one, new stamps can be cheaply made at </span><i>Gramedia</i><span>, a bookshop on the waterfront).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>1. Harbour Master</strong><br/><span><span>Mr Lucky (pronounced"lookey") speaks good English. Few people speak English in Jayapura, including people in the customs office. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. Immigration</strong><br/></span><span>T</span><span>his is an international port and visas (for 1-2 months) can be obtained on arrival by citizens of certain countries. See the main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Indonesia Formalities</a></strong><span> page for details.</span></p>
<p>For yachts coming from PNG a longer term "social" Indonesian visa can be arranged at the consulate in either Port Moresby or Vanimo. There is a PNG Consulate here for cruisers needing PNG visas, <span>not far from the Jayapura Immigration office</span><span>. Processing takes 3-4 days.</span></p>
<p><strong>3. Customs</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>5. Police</strong><br/>Within a day of your arrival you must obtain a <strong>Surat Jalan.</strong> This is a permit specific to travel in Papua and is issued by the police facility adjacent to the police dock where you come ashore (on the left). <span>The permit is free and you will need a passport photo. It takes a couple of hours to organise. </span></span><span>The police are very serious about this paperwork being acquired, however it's unlikely any subsequent officials will ask to see it.</span></p>
<p><i><span><span>For detailed information on the location of all offices (and other useful information) see </span></span><a class="external-link" href="../papua-jayapura-clearing-into-indonesia-here/">Clearing into Indonesia in Jayapura</a></i></p>
<p><span><strong>CLEARING OUT</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Visit Quarantine, Customs and the Harbour Master in that order to complete </span><span>departure formalities. </span></span></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Be aware that there are many large FADs at the harbour entrance.</span></p>
<p><span>There is deep water right off the city center and the police dock adjacent to a small neighborhood makes for a safe place to leave the dinghy (<span>look for this dock at the N end of the bay with a smaller police boat or two tied up to it). </span>Avoid low tide however when retrieving your dinghy, as this can be an </span><span>unpleasant experience </span><span>amongst the sewage and refuse. </span><span>Most of the families in this neighborhood are associated with the adjacent intelligence police presence and will keep an eye on your dinghy. The water here however is not very clean, but it's a useful place to stop for clearance.</span></p>
<p>After clearing in, you may prefer to move to the more sheltered anchorage in the SW part of  the harbour, on the south side of 2 small islets covered in stilt villages. <span>Watch for reefs you must </span><span>go around to tuck into this spot. </span><span>It can be entered from the north through a deep marked channel in the reef. </span><span>The water here is much cleaner. </span><span>The anchorage is in  20m mud, right in front of a small causeway leading out to one of the islands. <span>This is closer to the Hamadi </span><span>neighborhood, which has a thriving open market. Lots of curious and </span><span>friendly Papuan families from the adjacent stilt villages will stop by your boat.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There are many other anchorage possibilities in the area.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Diesel can be delivered by a local small boat owner or can be taken in jerry cans from the service station across the road from the waterfront market.</p>
<p>Very few people speak English here however everyone is reported to be very welcoming and friendly.</p>
