<div class="hello"><div><p>Semarang is one of Indonesia's five major cities and is in the central part of the north coast of Java. Tanjung Emas is the name of its port, around which lies the city's oldest buildings, some of which date back to the Dutch colonial era or older. It has a large ethnic Chinese population and the city houses several Chinese temples.</p>
<p>The harbour is also home to several traditional <code>Pinisi</code> sailing ships.</p>
<p>Position 06°56.5' S 110°25.1' E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an outer light buoy 4.5nm off-shore and the buoyed channel starts 2nm off-shore. Keep to the west side of this channel.</p>
<p>The harbour is well protected by breakwaters.</p>
<p>Call the Port Captain on VHF on approach, but there is usually a berth available in the <code>pinsi</code> harbour where you will find many types of working, engine-less sailing craft.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor <span>in the western basin near the haul-out facilities. The holding is good here in mud in about 10. </span></p>
<p><span>Water and fuel are available here.</span></p>
<p>The city has all the facilities expected in a major centre.</p>
