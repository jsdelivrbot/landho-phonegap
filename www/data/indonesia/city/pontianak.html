<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Chief Pilot is reported to be quite helpful and speaks good English.</span></p>
<p>Cruisers visiting here in November 2013 were advised to anchor opposite the Harbour Master's office in order to be "safer". However, during the night they were burgled of deck equipment and interior valuables having left the main hatch open for ventilation. Cruisers should take the necessary safety measures in this port and post a constant watch on deck.</p>
<p><span>There are no facilities for yachts here. Avoid tying up next to the wharf at the Fisheries Department where you may be directed with the assurance of plenty of water and soft mud. There is in fact hard sand and very little water.</span></p>
<p><span>Fuel is difficult to buy, be cautious purchasing black market diesel.</span></p>
<p>The water is non potable and should be purchased in gallon containers from water purification points. You will need to bargain.</p>
