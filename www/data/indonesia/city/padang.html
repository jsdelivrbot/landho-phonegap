<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from </strong><strong>the 27th February, 2016</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. See <a href="../KaiIslands/"><strong>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</strong></a> for full details.</p>
<p><span>It will probably take a whole day to clear-in here as you will need to visit the Immigration office in Padang town (about 30 minutes away from Teluk Bayur by road), plus Health/Quarantine, Customs and the Harbour Master, who fortunately are all located nearer the anchorage. </span></p>
<p><span>To clear out of Indonesia you have to go to Immigration first, then Customs and Health and lastly the Harbour Master. Customs will want to visit your boat and take some photos during the inspection. They might come with their own patrol boat, unless it is away on maintenance in which case you will have to transport the 2 officers in your dinghy. </span></p>
<p><span>Fees to check out are 20,000 Rp for Health and approx. 15,000 Rp for port clearance. Make sure to ask for a receipt as "special fees" or "gifts" may be requested.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Padang is not an attractive harbour, full of fishing boats and small cargo ships. There are two anchorages for yachts: </span></p>
<p><strong>Teluk Bayur,</strong> south of Padang <span>on the NE side of the bay.<br/></span><span>Position 01° 00.1'S, 100° 22'E.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Bungus, </strong></span></span><span>a little farther away from main town of Padang, but perhaps a quieter anchorage.</span><span><span><span><br/>Position <span>01° 02.1'S, 100° 23.8'E</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>The local fresh produce market in Padang</span><span> is good and there are a couple of “supermarkets”. It is a good place</span><span> to stock up on Sumatran coffee.</span></p>
<p><span>Although a two hour ride to Padang, </span><span><strong>Cubadak</strong> is a lovely island just off the coast of West Sumatra and an alternative to anchoring in Teluk Bayur. It is however a challenging place from which to arrange transport to Padang to get supplies, visas etc. The anchorage is off a resort owned by Nani and Marco, who may be able to help you with arranging transportation etc. </span></p>
