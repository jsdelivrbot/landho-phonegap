<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../GiliGede_copyrightMARINADELRAY.bmp/@@images/image/preview"/>Gili Gede is an island located in a big sheltered bay close to the coastal town of  Tembowong, approx. 15nm West of the harbour town of Lembar in South West Lombok.  It is one of 12 islands clustered together, very sheltered and surrounded by  hills (<i>photo courtesy of Marina Del Ray</i>).</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">There are no motorized vehicles on the island, so to move around you take the coastal path, a horse drawn cart or a taxi boat.</span></p>
<p>It appears that the planned new modern marina at the southern end of the island still just consists of a few mooring buoys and no other facilities (see comment posted below April 2016).</p>
