<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../indonesia-pics/indonesia_morotai_new-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>The new marina<i> (photo courtesy of Andreas Franke)</i> has space for approx. 20 yachts with depths of 3-4m. Water and diesel can be obtained via mini-tanker, just speak with the harbourmaster who is very helpful.</p>
<p><span></span><span>The marina is in a delightful spot, with very clear water and beautiful islands nearby. Provisions are plentiful in the local town but there are no marine services here.</span></p>

      Floating pontoons with finger berths and piles. Plenty of shoreside cleats. Depths approx. 4m. Whilst the docks here currently have no services, it is hoped that government funding will provide water and electricity points in the future. Keen to attract visiting yachts - pricing very low.
