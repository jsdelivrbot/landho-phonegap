<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from the 27th February, 2016.</strong> A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers is no longer required. See <a><strong>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</strong></a> for full details.</p>
<p><span>The port of Tual has clearance facilities. Officials are reported to be courteous, very friendly and helpful, they do not require any backsheesh on entry or exit and are efficient (see comments below). The only fees payable are for quarantine (health) and these are minimal. </span></p>
<p><span>The quarantine office is located behind the harbour master close to where you can tie up the dinghy. <span>This is near the Coast Guard's patrol boat </span><span>at the NE corner of the passenger terminal wharf. </span></span><span>Customs is a short distance up the hill, you can go either by foot or take a motorbike taxi.  Immigration is next to customs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>On departure, the HM office will issue a clearance document.</span></span></p>
