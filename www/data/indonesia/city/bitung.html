<p><b><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from<span> </span></span></b><b><span>the 27th February, 2016</span></b><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. See <a href="../KaiIslands/"><b><span>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</span></b></a><span> </span>for full details.</span></p>
<p>The Immigration office is in the port, but transport is needed to get to Customs, Quarantine and the Port Captain.</p>
<p>The officials here have been reported to be very friendly and extremely helpful and will probably offer to aid visiting the various offices.</p>
