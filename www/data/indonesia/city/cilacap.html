<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach channel is well marked and well lit but keep in the channel as there are shoals one each side.</p>
<p>If just a brief stop is required, there is an anchorage <span>just behind theTanjung Karangbolong Peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several anchorages off the town and up the rivers. Be sure to keep clear of the channels.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a dinghy dock off the town.</span></p>
