<div class="hello"><div><p>Tolitoli is in NE Sulawesi and is a convenient first port in this island after crossing the Celebes Sea from Borneo. It has virtually no tourism, foreign faces are a rarity and you will be met with warmth and friendship. The local tourist office is keen to promote yacht tourism and will go out of their way to ensure your stay here is a happy one.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong><img class="image-left" src="../../Tolitoli_Gryphon2.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Anchorage: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The anchorage is between the container terminal and the town in 10 to 20 metres.  Beware of a shallow area just N of this. Good shelter from all directions except perhaps NW.</p>
<p>Landing can be made to the north of the anchorage at the stage with a blue roof close to some other blue roofed buildings. Deo at the café across the road speaks good English (photo courtesy of SY Gryphon 2).</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong></p>
<p>The tourist office can provide all the help you need, Ishak is the manager. Hendra speaks perfect English and also teaches English at the university.</p>
<p>Contact: Ishak Tel: +628 524 108 5925 or Hendra <span>Tel: </span><span>+628 234 687 1777</span></p>
<p>Hendra will organise diesel, water etc. if you ask. There are 2 excellent wet markets in the town, but there is only a small supermarket with little in the way of western food e.g. cereal, cheese etc., so best to stock up on these before you arrive. Mechanical and electrical services could be limited, but there would be no shortage of people trying to help.</p>
