<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="../../indonesia-pics/indonsia_lombok_medana-bay-marina-view"/>This bay is just east of the Oberoi peninsula at the northern end of Lombok's west  coast. It has a great anchorage during the south East Monsoon and has good facilities ashore. Close to the three Gili Islands and with views of <span>Mount Rinjani to the east at 3,726m, this is a </span>very quiet and restful place.</p>
<p>Position 8° 21.9'S, 116° 7.8'E.</p>
<p>The <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.medanabaymarina.com/index.html">Marina website</a></strong> has good approach information on it, which is accurate. <i>(Photos from MBM website).</i></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-right" src="../../indonesia-pics/indonsia_lombok_medana-bay-marina-docks/@@images/image/preview"/>The villagers here have built a small marina with floating pontoons for 16 vessels (10 of which are serviced) and about 15 moorings in varying depths and a  dinghy dock. Electricity and water available. Berthing is alongside or med-mooring.</p>
<p>Noonsite has been told there are plans to replace the moorings with new ones.</p>
<p>Access to / from the dock is easiest when the wind is lighter i.e. early or late in the day. You can anchor or take a mooring to wait until the wind has eased.</p>
<p>There is anchorage space available as well. Yachts are charged a small fee for anchoring to cover the cost of shore-side facilities (dinghy dock, showers and toilets, WiFi etc.).</p>
<p>The villagers are very helpful and friendly. They can arrange laundry, fuel, small  repairs, cheap massages and tours of the island. Hotel Oberoi is a short walk away  and dinner there is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Supplies are available from the small mini-market at the marina, and WiFi is available at the beach cafe on site.</p>
<p>Tanjung, the local town, is 4 km away and has a good morning market, numerous ATMs, pharmacies and a post office. For larger supermarkets, it's best to go south to the capital. The marina can organise air-conditioned cars and drivers to take you there or to take you for sight-seeing tours. The roads on Lombok are good, although the traffic can be quite heavy around the capital.</p>
<p>Cruisers report this is a more comfortable alternative to the often rough  anchorages on Gilli Islands.</p>
