<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Situated on the western side of Batam Island, Sekupang has a ferry port that caters for international (Singapore) passengers and a commercial port.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Approaching from all directions is clearly buoyed as this is a major commercial area.  There are many fast ferries to be aware of, 25 knots is usual.  The local approach channel from the north is clear and there are no unusual hazards if you are working with the charts within the marked channel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Position 01° 07.272'N, 103° 55.62'E (anchorage)</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><b>Anchorage</b></span></p>
<p>There is only one practical anchorage here for small craft and it is to the south of the main ferry piers (approx. position <span>1 07.272 N and 103 55.62 E)</span><span>.  Here there are a few moorings that are used by the ferry services to wait in the daytime. Anchoring here is in mud at about 3m below datum, or you can go further out in deeper water.  The ferries make alot of noise, be warned!</span></p>
<p>Getting ashore is easy as there are several jetties where you can tie up a dinghy. The most southerly of the ferry jetties is older, smaller and obviously used for small boat traffic.  If you go close to shore on this jetty you can tie up and your dinghy will be secured and looked after by a few helpful boat guys for the day - for less than a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>
<p>There are no facilities for yachts that are obvious and the main shopping and services are in Batam, which is a bus or taxi ride away. There are some warung's locally in the port and cafe's in the port terminal.  After clearing out with Customs you can always purchase duty-free in the ferry terminal shop.</p>
