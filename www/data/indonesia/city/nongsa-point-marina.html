<div class="hello"><div><p>Nongsa Point Marina is an upmarket development located a few miles from Singapore on Batam Island. It is located about 45 minutes away from the main shopping area on the island.</p>
<p>Nongsa Point Marina is also the logical place to clear in and/or out of Indonesia if planning on visiting the nearby Amambas Islands. Whilst <span>Tarempa in the Anambas does have CIPQ offices, they are not yet authorised to deal with international clearance, so cruisers still face an upwind 140nm sail back to Nongsa Point to clear out of Indonesia. This may change in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 01°12.0'N, 104°05.9'E.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from the 27th February, 2016. A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers is no longer required. See <a href="../?rc=Formalities" target="_blank">Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</a> for full details.</strong></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>This is one of the new approved 18 Official Ports of Entry.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Entry must first be made at Nongsa Point. The marina staff will </span><span>complete all inward/outward clearance for you. They will need <span>last port clearance paper, passports and a copy of the crew list for immigration. </span> Outward clearance requires 24 hours notice. If you wish to do clearance yourself, you may be better to choose an alternative port as the authorities are all located quite a distance away from the marina.</span></p>
<p>Nongsa Point Marina ask skippers to notify them via e-mail in advance by sending boat registry and crew list during working hours. A copy of the document showing the MMSI / AIS identity must also be presented to the authorities.</p>
<p>For information on the new CIQP procedures contact Prakash at Tel: +62(778)761333 Ext.6110 / FAX +62(778)761348 / HP +62 811 777 8997, E-mail: <span><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:prakash@nongsapointmarina.com">prakash@nongsapointmarina.com<br/></a></span><span>Website: </span><a href="http://www.nongsapointmarina.com/" target="_blank">http://www.nongsapointmarina.com</a></p>
<p>Cruisers report August 2016: <span>250,000 CIQP fees per person. Clearance takes approx. 2 hours.</span></p>
