<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The anchorage is off the very prominent KFC restaurant and good is once the anchor is set in sand and coral rubble in about 12m. Shelter is good from all directions, although the fetch is quite long to the north and could make it difficult to land.  It is a popular anchorage with the few remaining sailing trading boats.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Landing can be made amongst the outrigger canoes at the nearby steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The town is close by with most services available, including water, laundry and a good market. Diesel is available at the fish dock about 1 mile to the west.</span></span></span></p>
