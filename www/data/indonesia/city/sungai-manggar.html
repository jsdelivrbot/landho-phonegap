<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Anchorage off the beach at  S02 50.84 E108 18.12 but it is likely to be rolly in the SW monsoon, however, there is some protection from the reef. In the NE monsoon protection is better but there is perfect anchorage in the river, which is accessible to yachts drawing up to about 2 metres, over a short bar, depending on the tides. </span></p>
<p><span>Enter from seaward between the 2 rock groynes slightly favouring the northern one. There is plenty of room for several yachts just past the fishing boat moorings in 4 metres.  There is talk of a new marina to be built shortly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The town is easy to access. Land at the ferry dock (near blue roofs) on the Regent’s large power boat and walk 300m to town centre with good market, small supermarkets etc. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Fuel is available from the local service station 2 or 3 km away, but not from the local fish dock which will only supply fishing boats.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> Frans from the local tourist office on </span><a href="tel:%2B6281368338977" target="_blank">+6281368338977</a><span> speaks good English, can help with fuel etc. and organised a car for an interesting tour. You might even get a free T shirt!</span></span></p>
