<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is is an official Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><b><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from<span> </span></span></b><b><span>the 27th February, 2016</span></b><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. See <a href="../KaiIslands/"><b><span>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</span></b></a><span> </span>for full details.</span></p>
<p>This is useful port for clearing in or out (internationally) of Indonesia.</p>
<p>To clear in, take your clearance permit to the Harbourmaster.</p>
<p>To clear out, visit Immigration (4 copies of the crew list plus usual papers), then Quarantine and finally, visit the Harbourmaster.</p>
<p>The Harbourmaster and Quarantine offices are almost opposite each other at the entrance to Pelni Port.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration</strong></p>
<p>The get to their office, <span>Ttke a Bemo to the "Terminal". Then take Bus #12. Ask if they will take you to 'Imigrasi Kantor". It will be  up a hill, behind gates on the right hand side.</span></p>
<p><span>To get a Visa extension, it is currently unclear what paperwork you will need when you visit their office.</span></p>
<p>You will then be given 2 papers, you take them to the cashier and pay 300,000 rupiahs per passport. After a short wait, you take the stamped paperwork back to the front. You will then be advised when you can collect your passport. When you return to collect your passport, the officials will request a copy of the stamped page (they do not have a copier in their own office!). There is a a place just down<span> the road across from the hospital where a copy can be made for less than 1000 Rp. Being obliging about this will keep you, the officials and the cruisers following in your wake, happy.</span></p>
<p><span><span>For a cruiser's experience on extending a visa here - see report January 2015 on </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../indonesia-officialdom-a-positive-experience-in-ambon">Indonesian Officialdom</a>, however, with the new regulations, the situation may have changed.</strong></span></p>

      The reach this office, take a Bemo to the 2 big mosques in the center of the city (past 'Terminal'). You will see PORT OF AMBON on a big arch near the water. Ask anyone to point you to 'Customs' and everyone will point you down all the way to the left of the arch.<br>
The English interpreter is most helpful as are the officials. Customs will wish to inspect the boat but are obliging in being prepared to travel to the boat wherever it is anchored.

      On the SE edge of the town. Best to use an ojek, or the bemos from the central market get there too - just ask anyone in the market area to find the yellow bemos to 'Kuda Mati.' Drivers will know where the immigration office is along this route.

<div class="hello"><div><p>A swell often works its way into the harbour here and there can be frequent squalls.</p>
<p>Anchoring off Anahusu Beach (where the Darwin Ambon Rally finishes) is a beautiful spot and adequate in settled weather, however holding here is very patchy. Anchor on a shelf of coral very close to shore in approx. 20m. This is a long way from town.</p>
<p><span>A quieter more protected anchorage is to be found by passing through the channel in the NE corner of the harbour into an inner lagoon. The best shelter is to be found along the west, north and north east shores. The bottom is sand/mud, approx. 15m.</span></p>
<p>The Marine Police dock and station here (approx. 03 38.3811 S / 128 14.3379 E) have a dock which they may permit you to use for dinghy landing. The Police may also be able to assist with fuel.</p>
<p>An alternative to anchoring in the harbour, is to anchor in the bay to the east of Passo. This is a large sandy bay with depths from 5 to 10m. Access to Ambon is excellent using the local minivan transport ("bemos").</p>
