<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Benoa Harbour</strong><br/>Position 08°45"S, 115°14"E (Benoa Harbour entrance)</p>
<p>This harbour is restricted by tide in parts and its entrance - on the Lombok  straight - can be tricky, with 8 knot currents and sometimes standing waves if  there is a swell and an opposing curent and tide that sets to the South. Time  things carefully when planning on entering. Currents flow south during the SE  monsoon and north during the NW monsoon.</p>
<p>The pass through the reef leading into Benoa Harbour should not be negotiated at night as the lights can be confusing. Benoa Harbour is a very busy  commercial harbour and the boats are pretty packed in places. Parts are very  shallow, and the shoal extends well into the marked channel in places, especially  on the north side of the outer channel.</p>
<p><strong>Serangan Harbour<br/></strong><span>Position 08°43"31'S, 115°15"11'E (Serangan Harbour entrance)</span></p>
<p>This harbour lies 1 KM to the North of Benoa and is accessed through a separate channel through the reef. It offers two protected anchorages.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is an official Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from<span> </span></span></strong><strong><span>the 27th February, 2016</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. See <a href="../KaiIslands/"><strong><span>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</span></strong></a><span> </span>for full details.</span></p>
<p>Previously any yachts docked at Bali International Marina needed to use the marina office as a clearance agent, but due to the recent changes in the regulations, this should no longer be <span>obligatory</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Customs in Benoa are reported to be very friendly and understand the new clearance system. They do however require that yachts that clear in here return in person every 6 months to renew the Vessel Declaration Form - reporting by e-mail is currently not permitted here (as it is in Sabang for example). </span></p>
<p><strong>Location of offices</strong></p>
<p>CIQP Clearance is still required, but hopefully should be alot simpler now the new system is in place.</p>
<p>All the necessary offices  are south of the marina within walking distance - except immigration which is in Benoa  town ($8 taxi ride). The Harbour Master’s office must be visited first, followed by Navy, Immigration, Quarantine and Customs, before returning to  the Harbour Master.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As an alternative to Bali International Marina in Benoa Harbour (which is small and often  full), there is a good anchorage very popular with the cruising community in the  bay opposite the village of Serangan. <span>Serangan is really just a small island, attached to Bali by a causeway.</span></p>
<p><strong>Benoa Harbour</strong></p>
<p>A buoyed channel leads to Benoa Harbour and Bali Marina is located in the NE  part of the harbour. The marina monitors Channel 77 during office hours (0800- 2000). Bali Marina is small- about 20 slots - most of which seem to be filled  with resident boats. They have a nice restaurant/bar area, but are expensive by  Indonesian standards (2012: US$25/day for a berth), and there are no moorings  available via the marina. The marina charges a US$5/day landing fee to tie up  dingies.</p>
<p>There are moorings here, run by a local who will find you if you pick one up  (2012: US$10/day).</p>
<p>A few sailboats manage to anchor north of the marina and moorings, but it is  very shallow and space is very limited here. Rumor has it you can also anchor  south of the marina and main channel.</p>
<p><strong>Serangan Harbour</strong></p>
<p>This lies 1 KM to the North of Benoa and is accessed through a separate channel  through the reef. Multiple masts are visible from the Lombok Channel and the  channel into Serangan anchorage is marked by a couple of red-and-green floating  buoys. The entrance is 10m wide marked by small unlit buoys, passing through  breaking reef. Entrance by night should be avoided.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/SeranganAnchorage_SYTotem.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Once inside the buoys, you have two well-protected anchorages with about 30 or  40 moorings that cater to a mix of cruisers and local boats. Even if these fill  up, there is still plenty of room for anchoring. This harbour is well protected  from the NW monsoon, but more open to the SE. (<i>Photo of anchorage from <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com">sv-totem.blogspot.com</a></strong> May 2013).</i></p>
<p>The price of all moorings here includes a US$70/month (Rp 600,000) Village Fee,  which is supposed to go to the people of Serangan. The moorings cost US$10/day.</p>
<p>Moorings can be booked via Isle Marine Services or Serangan Yacht Services (see details below).</p>
<p><span>There is plenty of room behind the reef to anchor in 7m mud. In fact, with the SE monsoon, there is less of a fetch here than at the moorings, but it's less convenient for getting ashore. </span>Swell protection is good everywhere at Serangan. You cannot  anchor inside of where the moorings start.</p>
<p><span>There are two docks, in constant use, where you can tie your dinghy. Security does not appear to be a problem here.</span></p>
<p>Drinking water is available from the shops in the village and there is a  supermarket not too far away as well as fuel.</p>
<p>This is a friendly, traditional  place, with lots of temples. Ask for Neuman or Leila if you need help.</p>
