<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is an official Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from<span> </span></span></strong><strong><span>the 27th February, 2016</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>A CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. See <a href="../KaiIslands/"><strong><span>Noonsite Indonesia Formalities</span></strong></a><span> </span>for full details.</span></p>
<p><span>It has been reported that officials here have heard about the new CIQP rules, but have not received official notification.</span></p>
<p><span>The Harbour Master's office is close to the ferry dock. You can reach it via </span><span>the only main road, it is facing the river.</span><br/><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The Immigration Office is in the neighbouring town of Pangkalanbun (a 20 minute t</span><span>axi or motorcycle ride). Your driver will know the way if you ask them </span><span>to go to "Kantor Imigrasi".</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>You can check in or out of Kumai, but not extend your visa here. <span>If you need to extend a social visa in Kalimantan, you have to take a four hour taxi ride to Sampit. The processing of the extension takes one complete day.</span></span></p>
<p>There are various individuals here who can assist with other services for visiting yachts. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices">General Services</a></strong> for more information.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span><strong>Approach</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong></span><span>Kumai lies about five miles up the Kumai River.</span><span> The river is best entered in daylight conditions and </span><span>after low tide. With rising waters you will be pushed into the river by </span><span>the tidal curr</span><span>ent. </span><span>After entering, it is best to follow the directional lights and signals </span><span>in the lower part of the river. After Teluk Kulang, you can simply stick </span><span>to the middle of the river. </span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers have reported that Jeppsen C-Maps are a bit more detailed than </span><span>Navionics charts in the river.</span></p>
<p><span>If you arrive in the dark or at the wrong state of tide, there is an anchorage </span><span>with good holding (but a lot of current) in Teluk Kulang, just behind the </span><span>first bend of the river.</span></p>
<p>Suggested river waypoints can be found <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://harryyachtservice.blogspot.com.es/p/kumai-entry-point.html">here.</a></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><img class="image-left" src="../../../resolveuid/b163862fdb8b4c7098e365d781fdba95/@@images/image/preview"/>Anchorage</strong></span></p>
<p>It is recommended to anchor approximately 100m from the eastern bank of the river, just in line with the freight ships, tug boats and barges waiting to be loaded with crude palm oil at the Kumai terminals <i>(photo courtesy of <span>Fritze von Berswordt)</span></i> . This position puts you just across from Kumai town, which is situated on the opposite bank of the river.</p>
<p><span>The river flow direction changes with each tide, but holding</span><br/><span>is good in mud and about 8m of water. The anchorage is </span><span>safe, but be sure to apply reasonable security such as pulling up your</span><br/><span>dinghy at night and locking your boat when sleeping or not on board.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Dinghys can be left at the speed boat dock between a restaurant</span><br/><span>(on stilts) to the left and a small supermarket to the right. It is</span><br/><span>best to tie it very close to shore below the stilted supermarket as you </span><span>will then be out of the way of the busy speed boat captains and their </span><span>colourful vessels.</span></p>
<p>If you are leaving your boat to take a tour up-river, an on board watchman can be arranged via your guide.</p>
