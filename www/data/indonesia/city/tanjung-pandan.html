<div class="hello"><div><div>Although it is reportedly possible to go up the river to the town (at 02° 44.823'S 107°37.456'E)  it is easier and safer to anchor off  Tg Kelayang 13 miles to the north and use Bemos to get into town. Approach is through reefs that give good protection, although Manggar on the east coast may be preferable in NW monsoon.  There is room for many boats and holding is good on hard sand. Approach and anchorage as follows:-</div>
<pre>Belitung approach 1   02° 30'S, 107° 40'E                                                                                                  </pre>
