<div class="hello"><div><p>These are two groups of islands lying south of Singapore. The departure point for exploring these islands is Nongsa Point Marina on Batam Island, just 20nm from Singapore.</p>
<p><span>Riau is the island group to the east of Batam Island, while the Lingga group is just over the equator to the south.</span></p>
<p>Be aware that the charting of these islands is inaccurate, both in position and depths, and that some of the tidal streams around them can be quite strong.</p>
<p>The Lingga group, in particular, is largely uninhabited.</p>
<p>Tanjungpinang is the ferry port on the western side of the large island of Bintan, which, itself lies immediately east of Bantam Island. <span>This big, busy city is well worth a visit if only for the market.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 0°56’N, 104°27’E. (Tanjungpinang)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><div>Approach is straight forward and the many fast ferries will indicate the route in but the buoyage is clear and the leading line accurate.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is an anchorage in good on stiff mud near the fuel barge at <span>00° 56.17'N,  104° 26.267'E.</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<p><span>Protection is good and the wash from ferries is not a nuisance as the ferry terminal is slightly down stream. Tugs and tows use the river so it is important to keep the fairway clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Fuel is not available at  the barge for yachts but only by can  at a stilt house close by with plants on its boards 250m up river.</span></p>
<p><span>Landing can be made at one of the small piers used by local ferries. Either the one painted yellow or at the excellent Chinese fish restaurant just north of it. </span></p>
<p><span>It is easy to get a water taxi ashore during the day but more difficult at night. Security might be an issue, as it has been in the past, so take normal precautions. </span></p>
<p><span>There is an excellent fruit vegetable and fish market close east of the landing jetties. There are supermarkets, but at some distance from the river. </span></p>
<p><span>The locals are very welcoming.</span></p>
