<p><span>Pemangkat has a famous temple </span><span>built as the worship place to the God that Chinese locals believe protects fishermen when sailing out to sea. This small town still holds many traditions of Chinese culture that are rarely seen elsewhere.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There is secure anchoring inside the river in 17 feet, mud.</span></p>
<p>Shallow depths and fish traps across the river make it advisable to use a dinghy to reach the town, although with local knowledge it is likely passable.</p>
<p>The local Navy post can provided a great deal of friendly assistance to cruisers.</p>
<p>Other than the Harbour Master, very little English is spoken here.</p>
