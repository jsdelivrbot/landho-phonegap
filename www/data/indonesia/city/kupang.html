<p>This anchorage is exposed to the NW and a lee shore in most conditions. Conditions can get boisterous<span> in the afternoon when <span>the northerly breeze sweeps down the anchorage, quite strong at times, raising a nasty </span>wind chop. Skippers should be diligent and keep an anchor watch on board, in particular in the afternoons, for any dragging or neighbouring yachts doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Fortunately this weather is rare for July when most yachts visit.</span></span></p>
<p>From the east or west, approach the given longitude [ E  123 deg 34.83 min ] visually during daylight or in depth &gt;20m at night (watch for local anchored vessels probably unlit) and close to the desired anchoring depth directly OFF the prominent red/white telecom mast behind the buildings lining the beach.</p>
<p>There is about 50 feet of water and the holding ground is good.</p>
<p>The latest report on the anchorage off the area known as “Teddy’s Bar” (<span>some distance to the west of the waypoint given) </span><span>is that the holding is good in 6m in mud and sand. It is popular with yachts due to its convenience to town.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The anchorage just outside the creek is also good holding in 6m, sand and mud (apparently where Captain Bligh anchored!). The area due west of this is not so good, mainly coral rubble.</span></span></p>
<p>When going ashore take care of local fishing boats that are anchored fore and aft to the beach (<span>where Bligh stepped ashore in 1789). These boats are </span><span>unlit at night. The surge can be quite strong so quick action on the beach may be required. </span><span>There's a new Teddy's bar hard by the beach which makes things a little easier. </span><span>Napa can arrange for someone to watch the dinghy or to take you ashore. Latest report from a cruiser is that a dinghy is quite safe left on the beach here.</span></p>
