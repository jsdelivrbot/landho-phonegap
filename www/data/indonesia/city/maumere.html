<div class="hello"><div><p>Much of the bay is deep (40m+) but there is shallower water closer to the concrete dock.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage just west of the ship dock in about 10m. It is open to the south and can get very rolly/uncomfortable.</p>
<p>An alternative, is an anchorage off the Sea World Resort, about 5 miles east of Maumere. Depths are 10 to 20m. Holding is suspect but just off the river mouth is good.</p>
