            </h2>
<div><p><strong><span>NEW Indonesian CIQP procedures came into effect from the</span> 27th February, 2016.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAIT, Green Book/Sailing Permit and use of an Agent to obtain clearance papers are no longer required. </strong></p>
<p><strong>AIS however is now mandatory and the authorities will want to know the <span>MMSI associated with the unit</span>. The new system should be quicker, easier, cheaper and more efficient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whilst this new online system is improving all the time, it will take time to filter down through the islands and numerous ports of entry. Feedback from cruisers however is good, and it appears to now be functioning in the majority of ports. </strong></p>
<p><i>The below information is correct "officially", however it is important to bear in mind that Indonesia has thousands of outlying islands and it is very difficult for the government to enforce their Laws, with each port interpreting them in their own way. Formalities may be inconsistent from port to port. </i></p>
<p><strong>New Regulation Requirements </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 24 hours prior to your arrival in a Port of Entry, log-in to the the new <span>Yacht Electronic Registration System at <strong><a href="https://yachters-indonesia.id">https://yachters-indonesia.id</a>. </strong></span><span>Complete the necessary forms.</span></li>
<li>Print out the forms and present them to the authorities at your first port of entry (make several copies).</li>
<li><span>The forms are self-explanatory and require similar information to what was previously required with the CAIT, such as chosen entry port, list of ports you intend to visit, ETA/ETD and so on.</span></li>
<li><span><span>When listing your itinerary, it is wise to put down all the islands on the intended route (and any others you may have to deviate to for repairs/emergencies) as yachts may not deviate from the ports listed. Restricted areas are East Timor and Papua. </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>By registering on this system, the Indonesian authorities will look through the documents and decide whether a yacht is eligible to enter Indonesia or not. </span><span>If a yacht is on their black list, they will be notified. If not, they may enter Indonesia and perform CIQP procedures at any Port of Entry of their choice.</span></span></li>
<li><span>Entry must be made at one of the 18 official </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=CountryProfile#MainPorts">Ports of Entry</a> </strong><span>listed in the Cruising Declaration Form. (Note: Currently Jayapura, Papua is not on the list, but may be added in the near future).</span></li>
<li>On arrival at the Port of Entry, the Cruising Declaration Form (as printed out from the On-line system) must be submitted to the Harbour Authority within 24 hours along with your port clearance from your last port of call. You will then be issued with a Port Clearance form for Indonesia (SPB).</li>
<li>Should you arrive later at your first Port of Entry than the ETA stated on your online Cruising Declaration Form, your arrival date can be changed on arrival as long as you have not <span>visited other Indonesian ports during the voyage from your last port of call.</span></li>
<li>Once cleared into Indonesia, yachts only need to visit the Harbour office at each port visited for a stamp on their SPB.</li>
<li>If for some reason you need to visit a port that is not on your declared itinerary, report to the harbour master in the previous port for authorisation.</li>
<li>The Vessel Declaration Form (again from the on-line system) acts as a letter of guarantee, therefore temporary import documentation is no longer required.</li>
<li>No agent is officially required for clearance.</li>
<li>The Indonesian government yacht commitee have agreed that "<strong><strong>for the purpose of their safety and security, AIS is mandatory for all foreign yachts cruising in Indonesian waters". </strong>You will need the <span>MMSI number associated with the unit </span>to complete the registration forms.</strong></li>
<p><strong><br/>Notes</strong></p>
<li><span>Should the officials at your first port of entry not be fully aware of the new system in place for international yachts, it is recommended you print out a </span><a class="external-link" href="../../images/pdfs/indonesia_no-cait-memorandum/view"><strong>copy of the official </strong><strong>notification memorandum</strong></a><span> (in Indonesian) to present should it be necessary.</span></li>
<p><strong><br/>Inward Clearance</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that your first port of entry is noted correctly using the online system <span> </span><strong><a href="https://yachters-indonesia.id/">https://yachters-indonesia.id</a>.</strong> <span>All the information required is now entered on line and you will be prompted to print out the completed form for submission on arrival at your chosen port of entry. </span>You may also<span> want you to <span>notify them via e-mail in advance. </span></span></p>
<p>On arrival, fly the "Q" flag, anchor and wait for Customs, Immigration and Port  officials to come to the vessel, during office hours (<span>08.00-16.00 LOCAL TIME)</span>.</p>
<p><span>Note that in addition the the "Q" flag, you may be required to fly the "N" flag also (the reason for this is not known). It is also required that the Indonesian courtesy flag must be larger than the boat's state flag.</span></p>
<p>No one must go ashore or  make contact with other vessels until clearance is complete. A small charge may  be made for clearance outside of working hours. Arrival on a Friday afternoon  should be avoided as many officials are Muslim and normally finish work at 11:30  on Fridays.</p>
<p>Having waited on board for a reasonable time, if no official comes to the yacht,  the captain should go ashore and contact the authorities. Usually the following  offices have to be visited: Quarantine, Customs, Immigration and Port Authority,  in that order. Occasionally Quarantine and Customs may insist on inspecting the  boat personally. This procedure only applies to major ports as in smaller ports,  the officials may ignore the boat altogether, especially if it is anchored out  of their sight.</p>
<p>Under Indonesian law there are no fees for clearing in or out of the country,  however, at some ports it may be difficult to avoid having to give "a gift". Be  prepared to bargain over how much it needs to be.</p>
<p><span>A Boat Stamp is very much a requirement here for all the paperwork generated. </span></p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Customs">Customs</a></strong> for details of permitted length of stay for visiting yachts.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic Clearance:</strong> Yachts only need to complete full clearance procedures at the first Indonesian Port of Entry and at the Exit Port before leaving Indonesian waters. When visiting other ports, only a visit to the Harbour office for a stamp on the SPB is required (although some cruisers have reported that even this is not enforced).</p>
<p><strong>Outward Clearance</strong></p>
<p>Only a visit to Customs and Immigration is required on departure.</p>

<div><p><span>Passports must be valid for more than six months after date of entry.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>New Visa Regulations - February 2016</strong></span></p>
<p>Nationals of 90 countries are now eligible for a visa-free visit of up to 30 days. This cannot be extended.</p>
<p>If a visa on arrival is requested, then the initial 30-day visa can be extended for another month. Note however that visa on arrival is not possible in every port of entry (Sorong being one of them). So if you arrive without a visa and want to stay more than a month, you will need to exit Indonesia (for East Timor for example) and obtain a proper visa before re-entering.</p>
<p>If a Tourist visa is granted prior to arrival, then the initial 2 months can be extended to a maximum of 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><span>There are two types of 211 Social Visas, a 211/60 visa and a 211/30 visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>The 211/30 visa is usually given for conventions or meetings that are short term and the 211/60 is given for Social/Cultural purposes. Be sure to ask <span>for a 211/60 visa which will enable you to stay in the country for at least 60 days.</span></p>
<p><strong>Visa Extensions</strong></p>
<p>These tend to be slow; expect to have to wait 5 or more days to get this done. It is wise therefore to allow time in your schedule for processing. Ambon and Tual immigration offices have reported to be efficient however, processing extensions in 24 hours. <span>Bring passports, copy of Sponsor Letter and a copy of your sponsor's ID. There is a standard 300k charge per person for extensions.</span></p>
<p>It really is useful to obtained a visa <strong>before</strong> arrival.  A good place to obtain them is at the Indonesian Consulate in Darwin.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <br/>- Indonesian Embassies in Malaysia tend to be very customer friendly.<br/>- Even with a tourist visa, some nationalities my only be granted a 30 day visa (some South American countries).<br/>-  If you don't renew before the 30 days have expired (so overstay the 30 days), you will be charged a hefty fine. So<span> if you see 30 days printed on the visa, renew it 7 days before the 30 days is up to avoid any problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>Retirement Visas</strong></p>
<p>Indonesia also offers retirement visas for 12 months, so people can stay in the country, fly home and re-enter Indonesia whenever they like.</p>
<p><span><strong>Arriving or Leaving by Air</strong></span></p>
<p>Crew wishing to join a boat or to leave Indonesia by air may find that  Immigration officials may want them to leave by the same means that they  arrived. Their intentions should be made clear on the visa application and again  on entry into the country. Crew arriving by air should have a copy of the  cruising permit so as to avoid the need for a return ticket. It usually  simplifies matters, if the skipper intends to temporarily leave the boat, to  sign himself on as crew.</p>
<p>Crew that needs to be signed off the boat while in Bali, must leave Bali on an international flight. Those who need to fly via Jakarta, thus leaving Bali on a domestic flight, need to be accompanied by an Immigration officer, the person who leaves being responsible for the return fare to Bali of the Immigration official.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One should carry a large quantity of photocopies of documents, especially the  cruising permit and yacht registration document, enough to be given to officials  at all ports of call. Note however that many offices are now becoming "paperless" and scanning documents, which is a good thing.</li>
<li>A list of offices where visa extensions can be obtained can be found at <a href="http://www.indonesiapassport.com/immigration_offices.htm"><strong>http://www.indonesiapassport.com/immigration_offices.htm</strong></a></li>
<li>There is a $20/day fine for visa over stays.</li>

<div><p>All forms now required are generated by the new on-line system.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Under the new regulations, temporary import documentation (PIB) for foreign yachts arriving in Indonesia for Customs purposes has changed. It has now been replaced with the requirement to submit a Vessel Declaration Form to Customs via the new online system in advance of your arrival. This will be forwarded to the Customs Office at your chosen first Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The Vessel Declaration Form can be used as a protection document during your cruising in Indonesia. The Declaration is valid for 6 (six) months and automatically extends every 6 (six) months up to a maximum of 3 (three) years, as long as you report to the Customs Office at your first Port of Entry into Indonesia for renewal.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><i><strong>Note: </strong>Some Customs offices (for example Sabang) permit renewal by e-mail every 6 months - clearly much more convenient. Others (such as Benoa) require a return in person every 6 months, or entrusting renewal to someone on your behalf, for example an agent. </i></span></p>
<p><span>The time-limit for the Vessel Declaration applies to the yacht only. The crew must adhere to their visa regulations.</span></p>
<p><strong>Firearms</strong><br/> Firearms may be left on board if they can be locked and sealed. If not, they  will be taken ashore and bonded until the yacht leaves. This can involve  Military Intelligence and other problems, so having a sealable locker is  advisable.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol</strong><br/> It is also advisable to declare any alcohol and have Customs seal that in a  locker too.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing spare boat parts into Indonesia <br/></strong><span>There is a clause in Indonesian customs that recognises that your boat and parts are under temporary import from Customs thus negating the need to pay any taxes or duty on any items associated with the vessel. Ask your agent for details. </span></p>

<p>In order to facilitate sailing for Singaporeans, a special multiple entry permit  for the Riau Archipelago (The "Green Book") was necessary and was obtained via the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.kemlu.go.id/singapore/Pages/default.aspx"><strong>Indonesian Embassy in Singapore</strong></a>, valid for up to one year,  or from the agent, Golden Image Services, in  Singapore. It now appears that this <span>"Green Book" is no longer required. Clearance with Customs must still be done, though.</span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span><span>For sailors in Papua and West Papua, police currently require a <i>surat jalan</i>. This is a local travel permit which is not provided in advance, but can be obtained from police at your port of entry in Papua or West Papua. </span><span>The police are very serious about this paperwork being acquired.
