<p><strong>101 Anchorages Within the Indonesian Archipelago<br/></strong>By Geoff Wilson<br/>Published by Red and White Publishing (October 2007)<br/>ISBN <span style="text-align: justify; ">9789791008051</span> <br/><span>Contact Siti Farahsanti </span><span><strong><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:farah@afterhoursgroup.com?subject=101 Anchorages">farah@afterhoursgroup.com<br/></a></strong></span><i>Report from a cruiser in August 2015:</i> This is the most useful hard-copy guide for anchorage information in Indonesia. All of the anchorages we visited were safe and well described in the guide. Our only criticism is that it would have benefitted from a more rigorous editing process: the numerous grammatical and spelling mistakes detract from the overall quality of the publication. There are also at least a couple of errors in the anchorage information pages (misnamed locations or lat/longs which belong to other anchorages). Well worth buying.</p></div>

09/03/2016 VE All formalities updated re new regs.
11/07/2016 SR Seems the new system is getting refined, now just one website, and it's easy to use. The authorities in the main seem quite laid back about yacht arrivals now and it's like a different country.....
06/08/2016 SR SY Catnap reported that Benoa Customs told them they have to return every 6 months to renew their VDF in person - email not allowed - but it is in Sabang. Have contacted Danang to get this confirmed.
