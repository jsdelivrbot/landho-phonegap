<div class="hello"><div><p>There are a number of moorings available most of the year in both mooring fields in Majuro. There are two mooring areas; RRE (north field) and Matt Holly (south field). It is advisable to dive down and inspect your mooring.</p>
<p>There is a floating Dinghy dock on the RRE Shoreline waterfront area, which is immediately at the shore in the north mooring field. This along with garbage disposal will be included at no additional charge for all RRE moorings. All others will be welcome to use the facilities for a small additional monthly fee with decreasing rates for longer stays.</p>

<p>North Mooring Field :© <span>Bonny Taggart</span></p>
<p>Anchoring is possible next to the south mooring field in plenty of space, however in the past yachts have been known to drag as the sand is quite shallow on rock.</p>
<p>Note that during SW and W winds, more rubbish appears in the anchorage than normal and sometimes oil spills from ships anchored in the lagoon.</p>

      This club was formed in 2004 to provide an entertainment centre for visiting yachts and to attract more yachts to the wonderful waters of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Cary and Karen on SV Seal can help with many things, including shipping in spare parts. <br>
The Mieco Beach Yacht Club runs a Monday to Saturday VHF net at 7:30am on VHF 71 and a daily SSB net at 7:45am on 6.224 USB.  The latter is called the Yokwe Net (Yokwe means hello).<br>
Their website has a very useful "yachties yellow pages" for the Islands.
