<p><span>Fresh water is scarce in the Bahamas. Either you need very large water tanks, or, a watermaker. If not, your days are going to be based around where you can go in order to acquire water - normally a marina. Some marinas provide water for free, but most will charge (50 cents or more per gallon).</span></p></div>

<p>Spend the Bahamian money before you leave the country (or find someone who is willing to change it for you) as the B$ does not hold its value in the US.</p>

<div><p><b>Phone &amp; Internet</b></p>
<p>International dialing code for Bahamas is +1 242</p>
<p>GSM connections are widely available, but BATELCO (BTC) is the only provider with decent coverage and 5G as advertised (although 3G in reality). <span>In the last year, BTC has upgraded nearly all of their towers and thus have imp</span><span>roved their range, speed and bandwidth. A BTC SIM costs approx. <span>$50 per 5 GB.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>T-Mobile have also now included the Bahamas as part of </span><br/><span>their Simple Choice plan. For one non-contract price of about $50 per </span><span>month, you get unlimited 3G cellular internet through BTC towers. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, the BTC SIM cards work the best and seem to be more reliable with much faster speeds. Plus, access is possible 10-15nm offshore. </span></span><span>You can buy a SIM-card for about 15 dollars. US mobile phones should work, however you may have to purchase a Bahamian phone for around 100 dollars. Pre-paid cards can be bought from 5 to 50 dollars. Call costs tend to be high.</span></p>
<p><strong>Comment January 2016 from Bahamas Chatter:</strong><br/><i><span>"We just completed 16 months in the Bahamas. We bought a wireless router ($50.00) on Amazon and a data SIM card from Batelco. Connection to the internet was rarely a problem although often the speed was slow. Plenty good for checking and sending e-mails, weather, Buoyweather, etc. Most marinas we visited had internet some free some not. The external wireless antenna (Radio Labs) was a big help also. We also purchased a cheap phone from Batelco which was very useful when docked for cabs, reservations and even texting folks back in the States".</span> </i></p>
