<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is wide and deep. The water tankers, which used to go in and out every day, are no longer needed and have ceased operating. </p>
<p>Once you’re in the bay it stays quite deep (4m) up to a certain point. </p>
<p>The anchorage is good holding in sand and grass and protection good except from the north. </p>
<p>The government dock is off-limits to private boats.</p>
<p>Shalom is the unofficial harbourmaster and loves to help with anything a cruiser may need. </p>
<p>The bar on the inner harbour is open afternoons on and has WiFi when open. </p>
<p>There is fuel and ice here. </p>
