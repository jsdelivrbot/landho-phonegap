<div class="hello"><div><p>Take care on the approach to this island as there are extensive reef surrounding it. Good light is essential.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage on the west side - close to the north west end of West Bay - however, shelter is limited and it is advisable to leave before anything in the western semicircle starts blowing.</p>
<p>Another anchorage can be found around the corner at Booby Cay. Keep a good look-out for there are a lot of bombies around. This anchorage gets rolly in eastern winds and it's advisable to leave the anchorage when strong easterly to southwesterly winds are expected.</p>
<p>Watch the weather closely and get out of here before you get trapped in these anchorages.</p>
