<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor on the West side of the basin in 4m sand, do not hinder the freighters. It’s not particularly nice, but a very good shelter if you need one, and there’s the commercial airport nearby.</p>
<p>There are several anchorages around the cays at the northern end of the island.</p>
