<div class="hello"><div><p>Ignore the stakes marking the narrow channel to the old marina. It has not been maintained for many years.</p>
<p>The best approach is that to the east, between Walkers Cay and Gully Rocks.</p>
<p>The area around Walkers Cay the area is difficult. The ground consists of hard rock and coral lumps and you can easily run aground. Be careful, keep a good lookout.</p>
<p>Since the area was destroyed by a hurricane in 2004, all businesses at Walkers cay have closed.</p>
