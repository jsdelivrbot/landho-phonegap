<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to the harbour is shallow but cheerful help with guidance may be had by calling on VHF channel 16.</p>
<p>There is a small marina here, but also an anchorage. The holding near the shore is reported not to be good, so beware of your anchor dragging.</p>
<p>Facilities ashore are limited, but it is a wonderful, quiet spot for snorkeling and fishing. Not to be missed, is 'Rosie's Place'.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage can be found at Sandy Cay, Double Breasted Cays. It is protected from all directions except the south. Be aware of the tidal flow between the barrier rocks.</p>
