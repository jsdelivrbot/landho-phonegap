<div class="hello"><div><p>Hope Town Harbour is a well-protected and popular harbour, so much so that finding a space to anchor may be difficult (and may not be liked by the Harbour Master). Hope Town Marina, Abaco Bahama Charters or Lighthouse Marina all have moorings for rent; contact them on VHF Ch 16. Reservations however may be necessary. Dinghies can be landed at the foot of the spectacular Hope Town lighthouse.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor outside the harbour, between Parrot Cays and Elbow Cay in about 2m with good holding, but you are exposed to the north and south. This is however a beautiful anchorage and lovely for swimming.</p>
