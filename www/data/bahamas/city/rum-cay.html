<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Nelson is located on the south western shore of the island. The government dock suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Joaquin and little remains now.</p>
<p>Yachts can anchor outside the main channel. The bottom is sand with good holding, but open from south to west.</p>
<p>To get to the marina, follow the shore but be careful of shallows to port. Keep a good lookout as there are some coral heads.</p>
<p>The old marina closed in spring 2013 and there are no services. It also suffered damage during the Hurricane and few docks are usable now, but it is free.</p>
<p>Very few people now live on the island.</p>
<p>Last updated March 2016.</p></div></div>
