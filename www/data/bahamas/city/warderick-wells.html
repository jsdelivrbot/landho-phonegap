<div class="hello"><div><p>In the north and south of the Warderick Wells Cays moorings have been laid out which are controlled by the wardens, and you are not allowed to anchor there.</p>
<p>The mooring fees are around $20/day for a medium sized boat (up to 55’).</p>
<p>The Cays are surrounded by numerous sand banks and bores. These are continuously shifting which means you have to keep a sharp lookout.</p>
