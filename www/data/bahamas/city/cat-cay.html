<div class="hello"><div><p>Cat Cay lies at the southern end of the Biminis. It is 50 nautical miles from Miami, 60 from Fort Lauderdale and 90 miles from West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Cat Cay is a private island, owned by the members of the Cat Cay Yacht Club. The island was once a stronghold of notorious pirates like Henry Morgan and Blackbeard. It has changed hands many times over the years but today this tiny gem (just 2.25 x half a mile) welcomes visiting yachtsmen to their full service marina (stay limited to 24hrs)</p>
<p>Position 25° 33'28"N, 79° 16'43"W (marina entrance)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas?rc=Formalities">Bahamas Clearance</a></strong><span> page for information.</span></p>
<p>The Bahamian government maintains a Customs &amp; Immigration office on Cat Cay, making the island an ideal port of entry. Officers are on duty from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM seven days a week. However, overtime charges apply on Saturday, Sunday and Bahamian holidays and weekdays prior to and after normal hours of operation.</p>
<p>The marina makes a charge for yachts tying up for clearance, even for as little as one hour, unless they stay overnight in the marina.</p>
