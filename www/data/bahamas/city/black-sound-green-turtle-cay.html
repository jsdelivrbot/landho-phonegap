<div class="hello"><div><p>Green Turtle Cay is a good hurricane shelter with <strong>Black Sound</strong> being the best option.</p>
<p><strong>Black Sound</strong> has a boatyard and 4 small marinas/docking facilities.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/WhiteSound">White Sound</a></strong> has two fair sized marinas (Bluff House and Green Turtle Club).</p>
<p>To get into the sounds is a bit tricky and certainly getting into Black Sound should best be done at HW. There are mooring balls available in both Black and White Sounds as holding is poor.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/NewPlymouth">New Plymouth</a></strong> has no marina or yacht dockage, just a good anchorage that offers protection from Easterly Winds. There are several reasonable stores in the main street, for hardware and food.</p>
<p>Position 26° 45'54"N, 77° 19'50"W (entrance to Black Sound)</p></div></div>

<p>Deep draft boats may need to use the anchorage off <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/NewPlymouth">New Plymouth</a></strong>. See comments below.</p>
