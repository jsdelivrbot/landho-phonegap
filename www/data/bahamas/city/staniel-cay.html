<div class="hello"><div><p>Half-way down the Exuma chain, Staniel Cay offers the opportunity to do modest reprovisioning (see comment below on missing mail boat) and charter flights can be arranged here.</p>
<p>Staniel Cay has been used in lots of movies, most notably the James Bond film “Thunderball”, and is a very popular tourist destination.</p>
<p>Don't miss the Thunderball Grotto.</p>
<p>Position 24° 10'N, 76°26'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a government dock at 24° 10.11'N, 076° 26.69'W<i>. </i>This is convenient for accessing two of the stores on the island.</p>
<p>The third store which is is on the other side of the inlet  (at 24° 10.11'N, 76° 26.50'W) has its own dock. It also has some hardware and marine items.</p>
<p>An excellent anchorage can be had on the west side of Big Majors Spot, towards the northern end, just south east of<br/>Fowl Cay Resort. The holding is good and there is shelter from NW through N to SE. You will need a fast dinghy to visit Staniel Cay from there.</p>
<p>The anchorage in the south east corner of Big Majors Spot, opposite Big Rock Cut has good holding except for a patch to the south of this area. This is very sheltered and out of the current.</p>
<p>Anchoring close to Staniel Cay is possible if you position yourself just out of the channel, but the tidal stream is fierce.</p>
