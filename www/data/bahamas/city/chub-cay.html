<div class="hello"><div><p>The channel to the marina is dredged and well marked and lit.</p>
<p>There is space for anchoring just in front of the beach. It is pretty shallow with 1.<span>6m (LW) and as it is sand over rock, the holding isn’t particularly good.</span></p>
<p>Although the marina is bankrupt, it is still open and yachts can berth here. See recent comments below from cruisers who have visited.</p>
