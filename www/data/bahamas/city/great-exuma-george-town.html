<div class="hello"><div><p>Great Exuma, near the south end of the Exumas, is the largest island in the chain with a large harbour where more than 400 yachts usually congregate through the winter, culminating with the cruising regatta in March.  This is the only port of entry in the Exuma chain and has an international airport.  If you're looking for company, George Town is the place to winter.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Once in front of Georgetown you can drop the anchor almost everywhere except for the busy shipping channel that leads from the government dock to the north. The anchorage is very sheltered but the dinghy ride to town can get you very wet.</p>
<p>With the dinghy you can enter Lake Victoria, where <span>Exuma Markets provides a dinghy dock with</span> easy access to the supermarket and other shops. On the opposite side a smaller floating dock gives direct access to the fuel station.</p>
<p><span>Nearby Stocking Island has Volleyball Beach - the place where it all happens. You may use all facilities as long as you buy your drinks and order your food at the bar "Chat ‘n Chill". WiFi internet is available, you have to buy time-slots to log in. Kevalli House Marina &amp; Cottages is situated here, offering short and long term storage and guardinage for yachts.</span></p>
<p>Emerald Bay Marina (12 Miles N. of Georgetown, Exumas) has now reopened and welcomes yachts. <span> They have some 'non-service' slips that are cheaper if you are planning on leaving your boat here. Cruisers do warn about the surge here however, so be sure to tie-up carefully and use chafe guards.</span></p>
<p>There are three marinas in George Town.</p>
<p>It is also possible to tie alongside the wall off Summers Quay for no charge.</p>
