<div class="hello"><div><p>Crooked Island (together with Long Cay) forms the northwest part of this atoll system, which encloses the  beautiful shallow waters of the Bight of Acklins. Crooked Island opens onto the Windward Passage, the dividing point between the Caribbean Sea and The Bahamas. Quiet and remote, the island's natural attributes are many, but with few resorces, self-sufficiency is essential. The weekly mail boat is the only regular contact with the outside world.</p>
<p>Cruisers report (January 2009) that excavation work has begun near the resort at Pittstown Point. So possibly a marina is in the planning and inevitably, things will change here in the future.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a good anchorage at Pittstown Landing (22°50’N 074°22’W) and the resort here has free Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The only dock is at Landrail Point, about 3.25 nm south of the Bird Rock lighthouse. Beware of underwater projections and avoid other traffic.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the Landrail Point area stretching from Landrail all around the north point to Gun Bluff is private property. This includes the beach. You are welcome to anchor but please do not anchor in somebody's backyard. The anchorage here has good holding but is rolly in almost any wind.</p></div></div>
