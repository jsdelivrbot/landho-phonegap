<div class="hello"><div><p>There are is an excellent marina here and a recently built resort on the peninsula at the approach to Treasure Cay marina which also accepts transient visitors.</p>
<p>The moorings at Treasure Cay Marina have pretty good monthly rates and are checked annually.</p>
<p><i>Anchorage: </i>Yachts can anchor also, however there is a nightly charge. The anchorage (in 2m) is immediately inside the bay, opposite Clipper Cay.</p>
<p>Recommended by cruisers as a good place to leave the boat for a while.</p>
