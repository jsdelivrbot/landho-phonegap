<div class="hello"><div><p>Much of the island's coastline is hostile with no anchoring opportunities and no road running along much of the coast, so help will not be forthcoming should a yacht encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>The only activity on the island is in the southwest at Matthew Town.</p>
<p>See the Noonsite page <a href="Countries/Bahamas?a=GreatInagua"><b>Great  Inagua</b></a> for more information about the island.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Review main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas?rc=Formalities">Bahamas Clearance</a></strong><span> information.</span></p>
<p>Boats are advised to call the Bahamian Defence Force (BDF) on VHF to notify them of their arrival and to request entry, and they will then advise the Customs and Immigration Officials.</p>
<p>The only Customs/Immigration office on the island is at the airport.</p>
<p><span>On the south side of the harbour is a concrete quay which yachts can use to tie up to for Customs clearance if no commercial vessels are using it.</span></p>
<p>It is possible to anchor off the beach closest to the airport in about seven feet of water in sand. This is best just south of the big "BURIED CABLE" sign (Waypoint 20 58.28 N, 73 40.78 W).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Matthew Town currently provides little in the way of marine facilities. However this is changing and extensive works are underway to expand the harbour and install a docking facility. The extended breakwaters should offer improved shelter here.</p>
<p>The Customs dock may permit boats to stay overnight, however there is only room here for 3 vessels.</p>
<p>Anchoring off the town is fine in settled weather. There are no dangers, however holding can be poor in places with sand over hard coral. With care a secure anchorage can be found.</p>
<p><span>A more sheltered, less rolly anchorage can be found at Man of War Bay, well past the Morton salt pier. Anchor off the sandy beach in about 10 feet of water (Waypoint 21 05.58 N, 73 39.20 W). This anchorage lies between two patches of coral that are partially exposed at low water.</span></p>
