<div class="hello"><div><p>San Salvador Island, located in the southeastern Bahamas, is a sparsely populated tropical Out Island Paradise rimmed by a combination of scenic rocky shoreline and powdery white sand beaches. World renowned as the first landing point for Columbus in the New World on October 12, 1492, the Island is just 12 miles long by 5 miles wide, the exposed peak of a sumerged mountain plunging 15,000 feet to the sea floor.</p>
<p><span>Cockburn Town, San Salvador, is worth a visit, claiming to be where Columbus first landed in the New World in 1492.</span></p>
<p><span>The Bahamas National Trust is looking to establish a National Park system on the island and have identified 5 areas that would be included (see news item adjacent dated June '14). </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Boats that intend to clear into the Bahamas can use either the facilities at Riding Rock Marina, just north of the main town, or anchor off the broken down jetty off Cockburn Town. There is normally quite a swell in the anchorage.</p>
<p>There is a basin to be used by Government vessels, immediately to the north of the old jetty, and small yachts may be able to find shelter there. The entrance has been reported in GPS position 24.03.160 N, 74.32.195 W.</p>
