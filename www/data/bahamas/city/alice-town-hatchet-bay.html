<div class="hello"><div><p>The bay has limited options for yachts as both the commercial harbour and Alice Town Dock are not available and the marina is now closed.</p>
<p>There is room to anchor here.</p>
<p>However, there are still about 10 moorings in the harbour. These are no longer free to use and were installed in about 2008. Their condition is unknown.</p>
<p>There is no longer water on the dinghy dock.</p>
<p>Much of the infrastructure here has been destroyed by recent hurricanes and has not yet recovered. Although run down, the town has most supplies (laundry, supermarket, internet) at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Being enclosed, it gets very hot and attracts a lot of insects.</p>
<p>The security of items left in a dinghy might be a problem here.</p>
