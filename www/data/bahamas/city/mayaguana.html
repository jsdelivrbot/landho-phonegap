<div class="hello"><div><p>Of all the Out Islands, this is the most "out" as well as the least developed and visited. It lies half way between South Florida and Puerto Rico, approximately 450 nautical miles southeast of Palm Beach. This eastern-most island boasts large stands of lignum vitae and other hardwoods.</p>
<p>If you love scuba diving in pristine waters, to go to places where nobody has heard of before, this is the place to be. Another reason to visit Mayaguana could be to Bonefish on the North coast also.</p>
<p>There are three settlements; Pirate's Well on the north coast, Abraham's Bay on the south coast, and Betsy's Bay on the west coast.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Mayaguana does not see a great deal of yachting traffic but it is a good place to break a passage.  Care is needed when approaching the island as Abraham's Bay is full of coral heads and yachts should exercise caution when anchoring. 
Drop anchor in front of the town, quite far off shore, in grass and sand.</p>
<p>There are a few facilities, reprovisioning with local produce, home cooking, fuel and even propane gas. The inhabitants will make you very welcome.</p>
<p>There are at least two good anchorages. It is possible to sometimes use the mailboat dock, but avoid other traffic and beware underwater projections.</p>
