<div class="hello"><div><p>Marsh Harbour, described as the "Hub of Abaco", offers most of the services a yacht might need, with a good choice of marinas, boat storage, hotels, restaurants and provisioning.  Haul-out facilities are available.</p>
<p>The entire island of Great Abaco also offers interesting exploration by vehicle, from Crown Haven in the north to Hole-in-the-Wall in the south.  The famous Abaco Parrot can be found in the Abaco National Park near the south end of the island.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Be sure to take the correct channel in to the harbour and not the commercial dock. A total of eight new channel marks are planned to replace the poles now marking the Marsh Harbour commercial entry channel.</p>
<p>Getting into Marsh Harbour is easy, but you will not see the actual anchorage until you’re close, because it is hidden behind the corner on the southern side of the channel. Anchoring is possible anywhere inside the harbour in sand and mud (good holding) but be sure to stay out of the channel. It's a short dinghy ride to the dinghy dock on the south side of the harbour, for garbage and a short walk to the shops.</p>
<p><strong>Be sure to lock your dinghy and outboard when ashore as there have been several cases of theft here.</strong></p>
<p>There are several marinas useful for cruising sailors.</p>
