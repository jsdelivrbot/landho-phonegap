<div class="hello"><div><p>The moorings are in a well-sheltered anchorage.</p>
<p>Farmers Cay Yacht Club announced in January 2016 that its nine moorings in the Harbour have been redone with all new stainless steel chain and line. <i>Note however, the comment at the bottom of the page from a cruiser who rented one of these in May 2016 and found his mooring to be unreliable. </i></p>
<p><span>Also, the dock has been replanked and braced. The restaurant is open from 9 am to midnight.</span></p>
<p><span>Other moorings close to the Little Harbour are owned by other businesses </span>on the Cay and it can be tricky to find out which one to pay as the mooring balls are poorly marked.</p>
<p><span>The tidal current is swift and the botton well scoured, so </span><span>unless your draft allows anchoring in the sand to the east of the channel, it is best to use a mooring.</span></p>
<p>Last updated May 2016.</p></div></div>
