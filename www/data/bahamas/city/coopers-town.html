<div class="hello"><div><p>Located in the Central Abacos.<br/> This is a good place to stock up with several grocery stores and a few restaurants as well. There is a Shell fuel dock and an Esso dock further south. In case of an emergency there is a small hospital here too.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Approach is simple and straightforward. If weather permits you can throw a line to one of the docks, but beware it shallows quickly. If the wind is less favourable you can drop anchor in sand and dinghy ashore.</p>
<p>This is an open anchorage and the holding is good. However, it can get very choppy and uncomfortable here in a matter of minutes. Always watch the weather.</p>
<p>Nearby, Powell Cay is a good anchorage to seek shelter.</p>
