<div class="hello"><div><p>A new entrance channel has been dredged into the Alice Town harbour which is nowhere near the old range markers, more like 1/3 mile north. The old range markers still exist - DO NOT follow these.</p>
<p>July 2008: It has been reported that all but the outer two channel markers for the "new" entrance channel are currently missing. Depths are still 11-15 feet and shoaling doesn't seem to be a problem. The entrance channel starts relatively straight in towards the Bimini Sands marina and then curves off to the left (north). Since the inner markers are gone, a night time arrival is not recommended.</p>
<p>Cruisers offer the following waypoints to follow. Care should be taken on approach:<br/>Outside: N 25:42.658, W 079:18.459<br/>Turn: N 25:42.681, W 079:18.261<br/>Inside: N 25:42.830, W 079:18.158</p>
<p>There are several marina along the western side of the harbour.</p>
<p><i>Anchoring</i></p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in about 4m, sand over rock, but the holding is poor and swinging room tight. The current in the anchorage is formidable. Berthing in a marina here is recommended.</p>
