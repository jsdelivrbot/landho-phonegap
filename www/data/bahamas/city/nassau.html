<div class="hello"><div><p>Be aware that Nassau is primarily a tax-free tourist mecca and has become a
"big City" with a commensurate crime rate. Be very street-wise. The crime rate is high (not only for theft), so take care where you walk, especially at night, and secure all your property as best you can. Locking your boat securely at
night and when away from it is a must, as is locking your dinghy and outboard when tied to the boat and ashore at a dinghy dock.</p>

      Can be called from any of the Nassau marinas when clearing in.
When arriving direct from a foreign port, Customs and Immigration clearance procedures can take place at any Marina in Nassau Harbour or at the east side of the cruise ship dock, Prince George Wharf, in the building with the tall tower:  you may also clear at Lyford Cay's private yacht harbour at the west end of New Providence

<div class="hello"><div><p>Before entering Nassau harbour, when within a mile or so, be sure to call <b>Nassau Harbour Control on VHF 16</b>, who will shift to working Ch. 9. This procedure must be followed even if passing through to one of the marinas). They will ask for your last port of call, request details etc. and you will be advised of traffic and given permission to enter. You should also call them before changing location in, or leaving the harbour, for permission to do so, when they will ask for your destination and advise traffic.</p>
<p><b>Anchoring in Nassau Harbour</b><br>
It is possible to anchor anywhere in Nassau Harbour outside the main channel,
but you must stay clear of commercial shipping areas where freighters
manoeuvre and unload. Harbour Control will probably advise you where to go.</br></p>
<p>Anchoring is possible in front of the Green Parrot restaurant and bar, at
25°04,7’N 077°19,6’W. Mooring buoys are planned. There is a dinghy dock and rubbish bins. Just have a meal or take a beer for this service.</p>
<p>There are two bridges across the harbour, clearance over the main channel
is 70ft at high water springs.</p>
<p>There are two other anchorages around New Providence, both good in settled weather: Old Fort Bay just East of the Lyford Cay channel on the North shore; the other further West at West Bay East of Goulding Cay. Coral Harbour on the South shore is no longer available to the cruising public and is now the headquarters of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. However, you can gain shelter in extreme conditions.</p>
<p><b>Dinghy Docks</b><br>
Going ashore by tender in Nassau Harbour from anchorages is more difficult
than in the past. There are two places where tenders may be taken, both Texaco fuel docks, one at Harbour Central Marina, west of the bridges, and
the other at Texaco Harbour View, east of the bridges. They make a small
charge and you can take garbage ashore too. You should lock your dinghy
and its motor both at anchor and while ashore, but do not impede access
to the dinghy dock for others.</br></p>
<p>Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association (BASRA) has a small dinghy dock so, if you come ashore here (and even if you don't), please go in and join this voluntary Association - it's the only rescue service in The Bahamas. Just west of BASRA is Crocodile's Restaurant, where there is a floating dinghy dock alongside the wall, for your use at any time.  Please visit the restaurant for a meal and a beer or two.  Both places are happy to accommodate visiting yachts but take no responsibility for loss or damage, so be sure to lock your engine and dinghy when you leave it, but do not block the facility for others.</p>

      If your boat is under 12m, forget this marina. 40ft is its minimum length.

This marina offers worldclass facilities and is an un-missable landmark with its towers, spires and domes and coral pink buildings. The aquarium here is spectacular and worth a visit even if you are not berthed here.
It offers every conceivable service that even the largest
mega-yacht could desire. No fuel available at this marina.<br> 
Out of season they have package deals, including resort facilities in the stay (for all crewmembers) for approx. $200,-/day. Good value if you have a large crew or visitors.
