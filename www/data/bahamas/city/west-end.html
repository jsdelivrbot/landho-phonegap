<div class="hello"><div><p>West End is currently being revived and Old Bahama Bay marina now offers full services, including clearance facilities.  Although somewhat inaccessible from the main activity on Grand Bahama Island, it is an excellent entry or departure point. The smaller marina at Harbour Hotel in only suitable for shallow draught boats.</p>
<p><b>Anchoring</b><br>
Anchoring is possible behind the breakwater of the Old Bahama Bay Marina, although it shallows pretty quickly after the Marina-entrance. Anchor in a thin layer of sand with hard rock underneath it, poor holding. Shelter is reasonable from ENE to W but not good in Northerly winds. Beware of wake from the high-speed fishing boats.</br></p>
