<div class="hello"><div><p>Leaving the Carolinas during the American Revolution, Man-O-War Cay was settled around 1780 by loyalist descendents. Long before the steamship and airplane linked the Bahamas outer islands with modern centres of world trade, the Island was self-sufficient through boat building, fishing and farming - all of which continue today.</p>
<p>There are a large number of holiday homes on the Island, and it's well worth visiting some of the local craftsmen who continue their hard-earned trade today.</p>
<p>The village is very nice, clean and everything is meticulously maintained. When you go ashore, it is advisable to dress properly as the locals are all very religious.</p>
<p>Position 26°35'21"N, 77° 00'13"W (S entrance to harbour)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is easier to enter this natural harbour through the southern entrance as the northern entrance is shallow. Once through the entrance, turn to port and proceed north to the Man-O-War marina. Alternatively, you may be able to pick up a mooring (any not marked 'private' or 'reserved'). It is very difficult to find a place where you can drop your anchor inside, but in settled weather it is possible to anchor just outside.</p>
