<div class="hello"><div><p>The colourful and orderly town of Spanish Wells occupies the small island of St Georges Cay, just to the west of the northern tip of Eleuthera. The main source of the prosperity here is the lobster fishing fleet. It has limited appeal as a tourist destination being regularly in the path of hurricanes, but out of the hurricane season, it is the quintessential Bahamian destination for cruising boats.</p>
<p>Position 25° 32.5'N,  076° 45.1'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is formed by a long channel bounded by two small islands and is well sheltered, although open to winds funnelling from the east.</p>
<p>At the eastern end there are 6 mooring buoys controlled by "Bandit". There is a well-kept marina and a hurricane hole at the western end where boats are secured to the mangrove trees.</p>
<p><b>Royal Island Harbour</b></p>
<p>Lying to the west of Spanish Wells (25° 30.9'N, 076° 50.5'W) this anchorage provides good shelter for deep draft boats. There are no facilities or services here.</p>
