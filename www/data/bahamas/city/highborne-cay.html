<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a private island and only visitors to the marina (in the south) are allowed to walk about the island. Crews from anchored yachts can come to the dinghy dock or to get fuel and are charged for garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The bay shelters you from anything but the N, but any westerly component makes it uncomfortable and rolly in here. The bottom is sand and very good holding.</p>
