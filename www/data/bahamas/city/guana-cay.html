<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an anchorage and a dinghy dock located in Fisher's bay (sand and grass). Good holding in sand. There are moorings both here and in the harbour, which can  be rented from Dive Guana.</p>
<p>December 2008, cruisers warn that in Bakers Bay there is alot of building work going on and Settlement Harbour is very tight and shallow and busy with small, fast boats.</p>
