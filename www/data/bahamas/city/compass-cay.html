<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is quite isolated and the store has only a few basic supplies. If anchored outside, there is a charge of $10 to land there, even for only a short time.</p>

<p><span>There is a good anchorage with all-round shelter south of the marina. The holding is good, but note the tidal stream runs at 2 </span><span>knots. This is a very quiet, isolated spot which you will probably have to yourself though there is room for 10 boats.</span></p>
