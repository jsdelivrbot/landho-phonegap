<div class="hello"><div><p>Green Turtle Cay is a good hurricane shelter with <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/BlackSound">Black Sound</a></strong> being the best option.</p>
<p><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/BlackSound">Black Sound</a></strong> has a boatyard and 4 small marinas/docking facilities. </span></p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Bahamas/WhiteSound">White Sound</a></strong> has two fair sized marinas (Bluff House and Green Turtle Club).</p>
<p>To get into the sounds is a bit tricky and certainly getting into Black Sound should best be done at HW. There are mooring balls available in both Black and White Sounds as holding is poor.</p>
<p><strong>New Plymouth</strong> has no marina or yacht dockage, j<span>ust a good anchorage that offers protection from Easterly Winds.</span> <span>There are several reasonable stores in the main street, for hardware and food.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Position 26° 45'40"N, 77° 19'41"W (New Plymouth harbour)</span></span></p></div></div>

<p>If clearing in, then New Plymouth has to be visited first. Customs and Immigration are open from Monday to Friday, but are often closed. Anchor out and dinghy in to clear. The lady officer in charge lives in the first house further down on the same street. She prefers it if you arrive to deal with formalities first thing in the morning (rather than later in the morning). Expect a telling off if you arrive just before lunch!</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring off New Plymouth town is in sand and grass and you can get as close to town as your draft allows, it shallows very gradually. Take the dinghy to the wooden town pier where you can leave it without having to worry about it.</p>
<p>Both <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Bahamas/BlackSound">Black Sound</a></b> and <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Bahamas/WhiteSound">White Sound</a></b> provide good sheltered berths. Deep draft boats however need to use the anchorage off New Plymouth.</p>
