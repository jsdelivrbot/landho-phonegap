<div class="hello"><div><p>The holding in this anchorage can be indifferent, but it is a useful place to provision. The best holding is near the old Club Med dock.</p>
<p>A good anchorage (that offers protection in W to N winds) is a good mile NW of the town anchorage, at 25°12,5’N 076°15,7’W.</p>
<p>There are moorings off the town, but without any marker buoys. Ask the port authority on VHF 16 before you dive down to find one!</p>
<p>There is a small, (and probably shallow) marina about 3 miles south at Runway Bay, <span>Palmetto.</span></p>
