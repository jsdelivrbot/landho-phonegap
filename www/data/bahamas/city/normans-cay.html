<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Norman's Cay is one of the largest islands in the Exumas and a favourite stop for yachts because of the surrounding reefs and secure anchorage. </span></p>
<p><span>It has an interesting history, as the island used to be under the control of drug lord Carlos Lehder. The old airstrip, partially submerged C46 plane wreck and abandoned buildings are remnants of this drug trade era. </span></p>
<p><span>Diving on the plane wreck is reported to be spectacular.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Fort Capital reports they have purchased 110+ acres at the SW tip of the island and 180+ at the NE tip. They have named their development White Tail Resort. In Jan 2015, construction of an extension to the runway and a marina basin was in evidence.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is good holding in hard sand off the SW coast near the airport. Note the airstrip is being extended by the resort developers.</p>
<p>There is also good holding at the edges of the channel at the mouth of the interior lagoon on the Southern end of the Cay. Take care with the strong tidal currents here. Do not anchor in the approach channel to the south of the pier.</p>
<p><span>The remains of a crashed DC3 can be seen in the interior lagoon, although it is now mostly submerged.</span></p>
<p>There are no dinghy docks here currently. Beach landings only.</p>
