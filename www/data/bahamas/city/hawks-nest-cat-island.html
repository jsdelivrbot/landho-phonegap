<div class="hello"><div><p>This island is probably one of the less developed islands of the Bahamas chain and is worth a visit for that very reason. The highest point of the archipelago is on this island at 206 ft with a famous landmark and well worth the climb to the top. Cat Island is not a sophisticated island so don't expect to re-provision except for local products.</p>
<p>Hawks Nest Creek is at the south west corner of the island.</p>

<p>Custom and Immigration are based at New Bight Airport and in <span>Smith Bay Harbour. It's a matter of luck if you find them at either, but you </span>can try calling on VHF Channel 16 to clear you in at the Government Dock at Smith Bay. This must be done before proceeding to anchor in New Bight.</p>
<p>Visa extensions are possible here also. Officials are reported to be very friendly.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The approach is simple and straightforward. There is a marina at Hawks Nest (med-moor) and an anchorage in front of the town. Make sure you don’t block the commercial traffic.</p>
<p>At the New Bight anchorage it shallows very, very gradually so the less you draw, the closer you can get to shore. Go as close to the beach as you think possible to avoid rolling. Park the dinghy close to the fuel station on the beach - you will need a long line to tie it up as the trees are quite far back.</p>
<p>Entrance to the fully protected Hawks Nest marina is on the southern shore of Cat Island, just around the corner (seen from the anchorage). The entrance is buoyed and easily seen when approached. Depth into the creek and marina is 1.8m (LW).</p>
<p>At the SE tip of the island there is a very sheltered anchorage in behind the reef in Port Howe where you can anchor in about 2m with good holding in deep soft sand. The gap through the reef is 100m wide with a depth of at least 4m. See <a href="Countries/Bahamas/PortHowe"><strong>Port Howe</strong></a> for further details.</p>
