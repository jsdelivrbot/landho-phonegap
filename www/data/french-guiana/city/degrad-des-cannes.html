<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the main port of French Guiana, located on the NW bank of the Mahury 
river, however facilities ashore are very limited. The buoyed channel is excellent 
and well lit, although reports recommend to enter in daylight at slack flood as 
the tides run strong. It may be shallow at buoy 12 (mud bottom), however they 
dredge the channel often. </p>
<p>Head up river a couple of miles and you will find yourselves deep in the jungle. 
There is a small bar up here where you can anchor overnight. The islands lying off 
the mouth of the river, should not be missed.</p>
Location 4° 51'09"N, 52° 16'34"W. (Marina at Dégrad des Cannes).

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="Countries/FrenchGuiana/"><strong>French Guiana Formalities</strong></a> for detailed clearance information.</p>
<p>There is now <span>an annex of the Harbour Master’s office in the marina who will deal with yachts clearance. However, t</span><span>he office has quite limited hours (open until 13:00 Mon-Fri, and 15:00-18:00 Tues &amp; Thurs.). They no longer stamp passports.</span></p>
<p>It may be necessary to visit Immigration at the airport to get the passports stamped.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It can be more comfortable (and mozzie free) to anchor in the river. A good anchorage is to be found about 300m beyond the ‘marina’ and 150m off the north shore, where there is excellent holding in stiff mud in 4.5m (plus tide). Beware of dragging in local  squalls and for the dredger as it works daily in the harbour.</p>
<p><span>Boats also anchor further</span><span> up the Mahoury River, </span><span>off the village of Stouppan. The river is well buoyed.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/MarinaatDegraddeCannes_TTemperson.png"/></p>
<p>The floating pontoons opposite the anchorage (Marina Degrade de Cannes, <i>see photo by Terry Teperson</i>) are  generally full of long term French boats, but they do have water and electricity  (220V) and sometimes there is free space for visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Local Services</strong></p>
<p>Yachts at anchor can take water for free from the pontoons. Fuel by jerry can  from petrol station about 4km away.</p>
<p>There are no shops around, except for a small restaurant in the commercial  harbour, 2 km away. Nearest shops (with many French products) are 8 km away at  Cayenne, "Core" is reported to be the best supermarket. There is a recently opened and well stocked Carrefour Supermarket on the edge of town, <span>beside the main Degrad/Cayenne road.</span></p>
<p>There is a local bus-van service  at about 3 Eu to Cayenne. It is safe to walk and many people hitch hike. There  are no taxis, however it is possible to hire a car.</p>
<p>The chandlery (with a big Yamaha sign) just before the commercial port may be  able to help with repair services if required. There is another chandlery on the  way into Kourou - on your left with lots of small boats outside it, however you  will need a car or transport.</p>
<p>Very little English spoken here.</p>
