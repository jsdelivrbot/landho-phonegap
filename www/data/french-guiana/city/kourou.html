<div class="hello"><div><p>Customs and immigration are not easily found in the industrial area of the main harbour. As local public transport or taxi's are not available you will have to<span> try your luck at getting a ride.</span></p>
<p>The customs office is on Rue de Charles de Gaulle. Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months. <span>The friendly officer will make a copy of your passport(s) and ship's papers. The procedure is quick, simple and free of charge. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/FrenchGuiana/french-guiana-2013-a-short-stay-feb-2013"><strong>this report</strong></a> for detailed directions to the office.<br/> </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>One possible anchorage is just inside the river mouth on the North shore, in front of the Club Nautique de Korou (CNK), clear of the moorings, by the Hotel de Roche.</p>
<p>There are also tidal anchorages up the river. Beware of the strong stream,  running at up to 4 knots and make sure you avoid any danger from large vessels  by anchoring well out of the channel.</p>
<p>The further up the river you go, the more sheltered the anchorage. The anchorage  off the Yacht Club at buoy 17 reportedly dries out and is very shallow. Deeper  water further out is exposed to the prevailing wind and in the full force of the  tide.</p>
<p>Further upstream at buoy 21 is much better, this is a good sheltered anchorage  closer to the town, with a dinghy dock and water from the marina pontoons. This  marina always seems to be full with local boats, but an alongside berth might be  possible for essential work. Fuel, provisioning and internet facilities (in the  bar opposite the post office) are all not far up the marina access road. There is a Friday fresh produce market.</p>
<p>Mixed reports have been received re. holding, however the bottom is mud and  rocks. It's recommended to check your anchor is secure and, if possible, put out  two anchors allowing for the tidal flow.</p>
