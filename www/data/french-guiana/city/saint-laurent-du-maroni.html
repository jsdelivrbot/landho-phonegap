<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/StLaurentdeMaroni_TTemperson.png/@@images/image/thumb"/>Saint Laurent lies on French Guiana's biggest river, the Maroni, which marks the border with Suriname. The port is about 15 miles from the entrance and is opposite the town of Albina in Suriname.</p>
<p>It contains many restored buildings from the period when it served as a French penal colony and is a wonderful historical centre with lots of character.</p>
<p>A new small marina opened here in 2015 which offers lots of services to cruisers.</p>
<p>Position 5°30.2' N, 54° 1.5' W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an offical Port of Entry.</p>
<p>For clearance, visit the PAF (police aux frontières ) at the car ferry to have your passport stamped (entry and exit). Not obligatory for European citizens, but prevents issues when your next stop is Suriname.</p>
<p>Customs (la douane) is in the administrative centre.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p>A buoyed channel for cargo vessels marks the route. <span>Following the latest survey of the Maroni River, the minimum depth at high tide is over 4m. </span><span>The survey and buoy positions can be obtained at:<strong> </strong></span><a href="http://marinaslm.com/rally/Downloads.php" target="_blank"><strong>http://marinaslm.com/rally/Downloads.php</strong></a></p>
<p>If in doubt (buoys are widely spaced), keep as close as possible to the French side of the river.</p>
<p><span>Beware of fishing nets when approaching the Maroni river's safe water mark.</span></p>
<p>While night entry is possible, it is not recommended as buoys closer to Saint Laurent are not lit.</p>
<p><strong>Docking</strong></p>
<p><span>A new marina opened here early 2015 with 20 mooring buoys. Construction of <span>the club house / restaurant will start at the end of 2016.</span> The swinging moorings are regularly inspected and can accommodate yachts up to 60 feet.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The marina can now supply fresh water (free of charge from the marina office), but it must still be carried with containers to the floating pontoon.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Anchoring</b></span></span></p>
<p>Anchoring is not allowed within the marina zone. Whilst there is no official anchorage, yachts will be asked to move if they drop their hook within 150m of the mooring field.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie and the Municipal police can issue fines to yachts that do not comply.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The first-known security incident against cruisers occured here in March 2016 when four crew were robbed of their personal items whilst venturing up the Maroni River in their dinghy. <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchGuiana/french-guiana-saint-laurent-du-maroni-robbed-on-dinghy-excursion-march-2016">See report here.</a></strong></p>
