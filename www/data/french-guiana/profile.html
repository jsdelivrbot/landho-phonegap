            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>French Guiana (Guyane) is an overseas department of France, sandwiched between  Brazil and Suriname. The atmosphere in the country is more Caribbean, akin to  Martinique and Guadeloupe than to the rest of Latin America.</li>
<li>The coast itself has only a few ports or anchorages, but the offlying  Iles du Salut (location of the infamous penal colony of Devils Island) are a  popular stop for sailors. These islands should only be visited after having  cleared into the country. The best anchorage is on Ile St Joseph, although there  are no completely protected anchorages.</li>
<li>Also interesting to visit is the Ariane Space Centre at Kourou, west of  Cayenne, although an appointment has to be made in advance. River trips, usually  by canoe, are another attraction of this small country, which is only visited by  a small number of cruising yachts, mainly French.</li>
<li>The Oyapok River, which borders Brazil, is navigable far into the interior  rain forest. At the other end of the country, bordering Suriname, is the Maroni  River, and is also occasionally visited by yachts</li>
<li>Provisioning is good, but expensive in Cayenne (except for French wine). There  is only a limited range of repair facilities. Good provisioning is available in  Kourou, where emergency repairs may be possible if the help of technicians from  the French space centre can be enlisted.</li>

<div><p>Dinghy and outboard theft, an increasing problem worldwide, is a problem here. Be 
sure to secure your dinghy and outboard with a cable and lock at all times, and to 
lift them out of the water and secure them to the boat at night.</p>
<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net
(<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>)
gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their
cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and
precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have information about
a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward
details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most
comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on
the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and
anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>
