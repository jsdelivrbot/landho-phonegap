<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Hanga Roa</strong></p>
<p><span>With winds blowing from the E-SE, the best anchorage is off the main settlement of HANGA ROA. Note that C-Map charts are not accurate here. On the south side of the anchorage are several coral formations marked by buoys. </span></p>
<p><span>There can be quite a swell in this anchorage. Be sure to anchor well away from the surf area. Good holding in compact sand can be found in depths of 20-25m. The water here is very clear.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Getting Ashore:</i></b> <span>Landing the dinghy in Hanga Roa can be difficult if there is a big swell, although there is a small and shallow basin, protected by a breakwater, which is used by the fishing boats. </span><span>Because of the difficulty in landing, it is recommended to use the services of a local fisherman, who will use his own high-powered boat to land the crew. This can be arranged via the port captain on Channel 16.</span></p>
<p><span>If Hanga Roa is untenable, one can land at Hanga Piko a mile from the main settlement around Point Roa.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Hanga Piko</strong></p>
<p>The small harbour at Hanga Piko <span>(27° 08.7'S 109° 26.3'W) </span>has been enlarged and dredged to about 2.0 m. The Port Captain insists on boats using a pilot as the entrance is very difficult. There is a fee for using the harbour, but no fee for the services of the pilot.</p>
<p>Boats up to 18m and about 2m draft can find shelter inside. There is space for two or three boats. The final decision whether a boat will be allowed in or not depends on the port captain.</p>
<p>The harbour is sheltered from all wind directions, but a SW wind causes a serious problems with surge, so boats must be tied fore and aft to rocks ashore. If one of the inside boats wishes to leave, all others have to move too. Some boats have been trapped here in the past in unusually bad weather with no way out because of huge swell. The harbour should be abandoned under heavy surge conditions as yachts can be damaged when this occurs.</p>
<p>For many years now, there have been different projects of building a small marina around the other side of the harbour but so far lack of funds have delayed these projects.</p>
<p>The only buoy here is bright orange and owned by a fishing boat. The Armada may grant permission to use it whilst the boat is away in case of emergency only.</p>
<p><span><b>Anakena Bay</b></span></p>
<p>In settled weather, there is a small loading dock in Anakena bay. This is a beautiful anchorage with a white sandy beach.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring:</strong><br/> Shifting winds can chase you around the Island. However, SV Migration created this excellent <a href="http://www.brucebalan.com/migrations/rapanui"><strong>anchoring guide</strong></a> between April and June 2008, which will be helpful for those wanting to spend more time at Easter Island.</p>
