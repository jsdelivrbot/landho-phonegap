<li><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Yemen/Aden">Aden</a></strong>, the former capital of South Yemen, used to be a useful stop on the way to or from the Red Sea. Cruisers in 2015 however warn that this port is now very hostile, and it fell to rebels in April 2015. <span>All the rebel-held areas bordering the Gulf of Aden have become major targets for coalition airstrikes.</span></li>
<li>The island of <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Yemen/socotra">Socotra</a></strong> is now open to visiting yachts.</li>
<li>Yachts have sometimes stopped at the Jabal Zugar and Hamish Islands to shelter from the weather. This practice seemed to be tolerated by the authorities, although going ashore is not advisable. Exert caution here as a yacht stopping for emergency repairs in February 2016 was shot at from ashore (see security section below).</li>
<li>Northern Yemen doesn't encourage visitors, although a few yachts have called at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Yemen/Hodeidah">Hodeidah</a></strong>, the main port.</li>
<li>Female crew should respect local customs and dress appropriately.</li>
<li>The Yemen Coastguard are active along the coast between Bab el Mandeb and Aden. Don't be surprised if they call you up on channel 16 asking who you are.  They may also visit you if you stop in any of the anchorages west of Aden.</li>
