<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruisers visiting here in March 2014 reported treatment by officials to be friendly and courteous. However, American cruisers visiting here in January 2015 found quite the reverse, and were boarded by aggressive military and treated with hostility.</p>
<p><span>In April 2015 Aden was reported to have fallen to <span>Houthi rebels. </span>All the rebel-held areas bordering the Gulf of Aden have become major targets for coalition airstrikes.</span></p>
<p>All Yemen ports should be avoided.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Be sure to make contact with Aden Port Control before entering this port on VHF channel 13 or 16 well in advance of the buoyed channel to get approval for entry.</p>
<p>It is recommended to anchor <span>on the port side of the entry channel where all the commercial ships are anchored. Avoid going anywhere near the starboard side as there is a military base here.</span></p>
<p><span>Beware of the big mooring buoys in the approach channel and also rocks and submerged cables in the yacht anchorage area.</span></p>
<p>Formalities are carried out ashore. The dinghy can be left at the ferry dock, where a customs officer will meet the captain and accompany him to the office. Immigration will be visited next, where passports are held until departure and every crew member is issued a shore pass.</p>
<p>A passport photo is required for the shore pass which allows a 7 day stay for no charge. This can be extended, again with no charge.</p>
<p>The last stop is at the Harbour Master's office.</p>
<p>In order to visit the capital, Sanaa, a 3-month visa is required. This costs US$35 per person and you will need written permission from the harbourmaster, which he will grant on condition that someone is looking after your yacht while you are away.</p>
<p>There are no check-in or departure fees, but the Port Control office must be visited before leaving.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>In the yacht anchorage t</span><span>he bottom is mud and clay, but not always good holding as there is alot of junk on the sea bottom: old tyres, moorings, bits of pipe and steel-work. The wind generally blows from the east but can swirl around sometimes and there is also a fair amount of tide ripping through the anchorage.</span></p>
<p><span>The inner harbour offers reasonable shelter.</span></p>
<p><span>Diesel is available at the fuel dock - ask the locals to help you.</span></p>

      Anchorage off the tourist jetty (steps at the end to leave dinghy). Night entry not easy as unlit buoys and dolphins encumber the way to the anchorage.
