<div class="hello"><div><p>Bridgetown is the capital of Barbados and lies on the island's south west corner.</p>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See the <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Barbados?rc=Formalities">Barbados Formalities</a> </b>page for full details on clearing into and out of Barbados.</p>
<p>Clearance can only be done in the Deepwater Harbour north of Bridgetown.</p>
<p>On approach, yachts should call the signal station on VHF Channel 12 (call sign 8PB) and will be advised where to proceed.</p>
<p>Time your arrival, if you can, for the morning to avoid unecessary hanging around. Cruise ships enter and leave port in the afternoon, therefore an afternoon arrival may mean several hours of circling outside the port before you can be dealt with.</p>
<p>Once permission is given, the yacht should go into the Deepwater Harbour and unless advised to the contrary come alongside the Cross Berth, in the southern corner.</p>
<p>Because of the large fenders set up for cruise ships, this is an unsatisfactory place to tie up a sailing boat, especially if there is any surge. If so, it may be better to launch the dinghy and for the captain to visit the various offices while the rest of the crew stay with the boat. Permission must be sought in advance to do this. <i>See comment at bottom of page from cruiser who visited December 2014 about this option.</i></p>
<p>It is necessary to stay in radio contact while entering the harbour to ensure no other vessel is manoeuvring, as the harbour frequently has cruise ships berthed there.</p>
<p>The Q flag must be flown until clearance is completed. The captain only, should proceed to clear Customs, Health and Immigration in the Customs Examination Hall behind the Cross Berth, from 06:00-22:00 seven days a week.</p>
<p>Overtime rates will be charged after 17:00. If arriving outside these hours, yachts may be directed by the signal station to anchor in the Quarantine anchorage in Carlisle Bay and the crew should not go ashore. The following morning the yacht must proceed into the Deepwater Harbour as outlined above.</p>
<p>Permission has to be obtained from Customs, preferably requested on arrival, if wishing to cruise or anchor along the coast away from Carlisle Bay.</p>
<p>On departure, the Port Authority's clearance must be obtained first in order to get customs clearance. Immigration must be visited last.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>After entry formalities are complete, a yacht may anchor in Carlisle Bay or berth in the Careenage in the centre of town.</p>
<p>Docking space in the Careenage is limited and permission to berth there must be obtained from the harbour master at the Barbados Port Authority (Tel. 436-6883).</p>
<p>Most yachts anchor in Carlisle Bay, which is beautiful but does suffer from swell. It is also rather crowded with moorings. Dinghies can be left at the Boatyard jetty which has some facilities for cruising boats, such as toilets, showers and water. They <span>charge a daily fee to use the jetty (redeemable at the bar), but only during the day. After dusk no fee is payable. Alternatively pull your dinghy up the beach.</span></p>
<p>There may be an available mooring buoy to rent. The yacht club has moorings and b<span>eing a member of any yacht club entitles you to a weeks honorary membership and use of their facilities.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There have been several reports of a "noise war" on the waterfront from the cafes and bars there. Since the loudspeakers are directed out to sea, sleep can often be difficult for boats at anchor <span>out the front of Cococabana</span><span>, but not so bad when upwind at the yacht club. </span><span>We understand that this is only a real problem during the high season.</span></p>
