<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See the </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Barbados?rc=Formalities">Barbados Formalities</a> </b><span>page for full details on clearing into and out of Barbados.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Port St Charles is an official port of entry.</span></span></p>
<p><span>On approach, fly the 'Q' flag and call the dockmaster, on VHF16 or 77 for instructions. You may or may not get an answer.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Arriving vessels should tie up at the fuel dock if they cannot make contact via VHF and the skipper go ashore to complete formalities with the authorities at the end of the dock. </span></p>
<p><span>Yachts are not encouraged to anchor here and dinghy ashore, as the authorities will want to be able to "see" the boat.</span></p>
<p>After clearance, you can obtain permission to anchor in Carlisle Bay.</p>
<p>Holding tanks are obligatory.</p>
<p>In the past, it has been reported that smaller yachts (i.e. less than 150 feet) are not especially welcome at the marina.</p>
<p>Last checked May 2016.</p></div></div>
