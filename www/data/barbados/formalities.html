<div><p>The Barbados Customs' rule that yachts must clear in and out of the same customs station no longer applies.</p>
<p>On arrival a boat must proceed directly to the Port of Entry and contact them on VHF channel 16 or 12 for directions on where to berth. You are not allowed to anchor and dinghy in as officials will want a visual of the yacht.</p>
<p>At Port St Charles, contact the Customs directly on VHF ch. 16 or 77 and stay aboard until visited. This is the more yacht-friendly port at which to clear in.</p>
<p>Once cleared into Bridgetown, you can move to an anchorage in Carlisle Bay. Note however that cruise ships and mega-yachts take priority here, and if you arrive here in the afternoon when the cruise ships move in and out of port, you may be circling outside the harbour for several hours!</p>
<p>Visiting any other areas outside the Port of Clearance requires permission from Customs and Port Authority, and they will require a copy of your schedule.</p>
<p>At present customs are reluctant to give you permission to visit other anchorages lying along the west coast of the island. There are plans to open up more cruising areas and marker buoys are being placed at several locations where there are sandy areas big enough to permit anchoring. A chart showing these authorized anchoring areas will eventually be available from the Barbados Port Authority.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid three months beyond the length of stay.</p>
<p>Visas are not required for stays of up to three months in any six for nationals of the European Union. Nor are visas required by nationals of any CARICOM country.</p>
<p>Citizens of most British Commonwealth countries can stay for up to 6 months without a visa.</p>
<p>For an up todate list of countries whose nationals require a visa see <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.bb/pageselect.cfm?page=120"><strong>www.foreign.gov.bb</strong></a></p>
<p>Extensions are possible, but it is best to state the maximum time one intends to stay. Extensions must be applied for at the immigration office in the harbour (open 08:30-16:30), and are time-consuming to obtain.</p>
<p><b>Crew changes</b></p>
<p>Immigration must be notified of any crew changes. Crew flying in must have a letter from the captain confirming that they will be leaving by yacht. They may still have difficulties with Immigration officers at the airport if an onward air ticket cannot be shown, so it is advisable for the captain to meet crew and take the ship's papers along.</p>
<p>If any crew are leaving the yacht, they must go with the captain to inform Immigration. If not transfering to another yacht, <span>crew must provide evidence of both accommodation and plane ticket from Barbados. Immigration will add notes to the yacht's arrival document with the crew’s hotel and flight details and this document will be requested upon the yacht's departure from Barbados.</span></p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Barbados is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</p>

<div><p>Over 50% of the shallow waters around the island have coral reefs. These are vital to the tourist industry and yacht anchors are seen as a major threat. Anchoring (collecting or otherwise damaging) coral is forbidden. Penalties of US$25,000 and possible imprisonment are in place for anchoring on a coral reef. </p>
<p>Buoyed anchoring areas may be in place in the future; in the meantime you are responsible for making sure you anchor in sand not on coral. All areas not clearly visible as sand bottoms should be considered as coral reefs. You must also get permission from Customs and Port Authority.</p>
