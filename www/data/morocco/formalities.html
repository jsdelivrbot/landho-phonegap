            </h2>
<div><p>Entry to the country <b>must</b> be made at an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p>It is advisable to call the port via VHF and request permission to enter. Fly the <code>Q</code> flag and a Moroccan courtesy flag. This is a must and a real door opener.</p>
<p>All crew members, including the captain, are supposed to remain on board until formalities have been completed, but in practice the captain may have to go ashore to look for the officials in order to report the yacht's arrival and request clearance.</p>
<p>First report to Customs, who will require an inventory and a crew list. Customs often keep the ship's papers until departure. An entry declaration must be filled in at the Capitainerie office (Port Captain's office).</p>
<p>Speaking French is very helpful as it makes formalities much easier. also, having a ship's stamp (or any other stamp) is very useful as you have to fill in the same papers as a cargo ship.</p>
<p>Health control is done by Santé Maritime and a complete maritime health declaration must be made. It is also necessary to clear with Immigration, who may keep passports until departure and will issue a shore pass. Crew lists are also useful; the list should also contain their occupation.</p>
<p>Yachts must check in with the port captain and police at each port visited. Occasionally photographs may be taken of the boat and crew by officials.</p>
