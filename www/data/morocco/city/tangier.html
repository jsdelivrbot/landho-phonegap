<div class="hello"><div><p>For the new visitor to Morocco, Tangier can be a bit of a shock. Children beg for money,  and ‘Official’ guides pester everywhere. In these respects, Tangier is untypical of other places in Morocco. However, it is an interesting and lively place to visit. <span>The hassle is tolerable, especially if you arrange a Moroccan companion or hire a (professional) guide.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 35° 47'20"N, 05° 47'23"W (harbour entrance)</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If it is possible, go alongside the dock inside the small boat harbour, which is crowded with fishing boats.</p>
<p>Fly the <code>Q</code> flag and go directly with all passports to the border police whose office is on the second floor in the white building next to the closed yacht club. They will retain the ship's papers until departure and issue entry permits which must be carried at all times when ashore. Customs will came to the pontoon and they do inspect some yachts. Formalities are quick and efficient. No tip is expected.</p>
<p>Allow time to retrieve your ship's papers when leaving.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is very crowded and finding a berth can be difficult. Conditions for yachts are basic and prices are high considering there are no services. There are pontoons at the western end of the fishing harbour, but at low tide it can be difficult getting ashore. You may well be put alongside a tug.</p>
<p>Be sure to lock the boat as the port security does not actually check the identity of visitors. It is best to hire a guard.</p>
<p>Currently there is no water, electricity or other facilities available here. A new marina continues to be "under construction" and it is not known when this will be completed.</p>
<p>There are no repair facilities here.</p>
<p>Harbour dues are payable at the C<span>apitainerie.</span></p>
<p>The marina further east at <b><a class="external-link" href="../MarinaSmir">Marina Smir</a></b> or south at <b><a class="external-link" href="../Rabat">Rabat</a></b>, are much better alternatives to leave the boat if wishing to visit the interior of the country.</p>
