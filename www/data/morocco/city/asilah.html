<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying about 25nm south of Tangier, this town has an attractive old Medina and is a popular tourist resort, especially in August. Visiting yachts are not common and the people are very friendly.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not an official port of entry. <a href="../Tangier"><strong>Tangier</strong></a> is the nearest port where all clearance formalities can be completed.</p>
<p>Report to the Coastguard. They may come to the boat anyway.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor in between the small fishing boat moorings. The bottom is sand and it is best to anchor fore and aft to limit the swing and keep clear of the channel.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to raft up alongside the wall or a big fishing boat, (when a small gift of, say, a packet of cigarettes, would be much appreciated).</p>
<p>The swell is severe in this small harbour during the winter, at which season Tangier is a better option.</p>
<p>The harbour is shallow and entry should only be attempted is calm weather.</p>
<p>Plans for a marina here have been abandonded.</p>
