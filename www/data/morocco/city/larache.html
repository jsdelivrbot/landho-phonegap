<div class="hello"><div><p>This busy commercial port, at the entrance to the Oued Loukos river, lies about 25nm south of Asilah. As with <span>Rabat and Allischa, this harbour should not be entered with any size of swell running. Only enter in calm conditions.</span></p>
<p>Whilst facilities for yachts are limited, authorities and local fisherman are reported to be very friendly.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Within the harbour is a floating pontoon (on the starboard side after official offices) to which you will be directed on arrival. It's likely the military will want to come on board, however all officials are reported to be friendly. The skipper will have to go to the nearby police office for registration, which is fast and efficient. This is not a port of clearance.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Depths are reported to be good in this harbour and its entrance.</p>
<p>The floating pontoon for yachts is guarded by the military and has excellent security.</p>
<p><span>This is a beautiful town with a wonderful medina (just 200m from docking) with a small market and some shops. You can hear old Moroccan music from the 18 century on Sunday evenings here. The modern centre with bars and restaurants and shops for provisioning, plus banks, is 400m away.</span></p>
