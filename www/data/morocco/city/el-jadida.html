<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying approximately 50 miles SW of Casablanca, El Jadida is a quiet seaside town with a Mediterranean feel. It has an interesting old town and Portuguese fort.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The skipper should go ashore with the passports and ship's papers and visit the 
capitainerie, douanes and police, all of which are in the harbour area. Officials 
are reported to be friendly and formalities straightforward, but they can take a 
while. They may visit the boat instead.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Due to silting the minimum depth in the harbour is now about 1.8m. There is 
about 2m in the entrance at low water. Best not to approach 
before half tide. Stay close to the northern breakwater when entering.</p>
<p>The yacht berths are full of local boats, but yachts can anchor in the fishing 
port off the yacht club. You can also anchor south of the northern breakwater in 
3.5 meter at LW. There is a good anchorage off the harbour entrance, but no 
protection from the NW swell, which is common in winter.</p>
<p>The dinghy can be left at the Club Nautique, which has no facilities except a 
restaurant. The services of the yacht club's security guard, Rachid, are 
available. He is extremely helpful.</p>
<p>The harbour itself is rather dirty, but it is safe and sheltered. If leaving for 
a visit inland, it is a good idea to employ a "babysitter" for the boat, if only 
to stop inquisitive children climbing all over it!</p>
<p>Price is 250 dirham for a 47 feet, anchored south of the northern 
breakwater. You have to leave before 11.00 or you have to pay for 
an extra day. Prices are higher than in Rabat where they have all facilities.</p>
