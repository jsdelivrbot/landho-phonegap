<div class="hello"><div><p>This capital city of Morocco lies about 125 NM south of Tangier on the Bouregreg River.

Even so, there is plenty of atmosphere to be found in the old part of the city, in the Medina, and the Kasbah.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Rabat´s once busy port has suffered from the silting of the Bouregreg River, however long-term dredging has improved the situation here (for the time being).</p>
<p>It is not advisable to enter the port at night. Unmarked fishing nets and hard to see channel marks can make the entrance hazardous.</p>
<p>The port is about a mile from the river entrance.</p>
<p>Extreme care should be exercised when entering Rabat harbour (a tidal river  channel) when a strong swell is running and at low tide. Entry with a strong  westerly wind would be dangerous. Large swells will break between the  breakwaters at the harbour entrance. It is also wise to watch out for sand reefs  on the port side if there are strong tides when entering. This website  <a href="httP://www.windguru.cz"><strong>www.windguru.cz</strong> </a> has the swell forecast for Rabat. If  it is more than 2m then it is likely that the port will be closed.</p>
<p>The advice is to telephone or radio (VHF Ch:10) the marina on arrival, and they  will send a pilot boat out to escort you up the river. This is part of the  marina service and it is available 24/7. The staff are very friendly and  helpful.</p>
<p>The marina, which was opened in March 2008, lies on the northern side of the  city at Sale. There is complete shelter here.</p>
<p>Beware of the strong current in the river and the low bridge just beyond the  marina entrance. Entering at slack water might be advisable. Cruisers visiting  the marina have reported seeing no less than 3 metres in the channel.</p>
