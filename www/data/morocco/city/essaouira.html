<div class="hello"><div><p>This small port approx. 131nm south of El Jadida, is not an official port of 
entry, but yachts may call there.</p>
<p>This ancient port still has its battlements with cannons mounted on top. Its 
harbour is an interesting and bustling fishing port. A prominent feature is the 
beach, which stretches south from the town for about two miles.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Immigration Office is at the harbour gate by the beach. The captain must present passports and ship's papers.</p>
<p>Also visit the Port Authority and the Harbour Master to fill out the various forms. Officials all very friendly.</p>
<p>It is likely the officials will find you first.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is shallow as well as narrow, so careful pilotage is required when entering here. The harbour itself is well protected but quite shallow.</p>
<p>There is a pontoon on the inside of the wall next to Chez Sam's restaurant. There is no security here and the police insist that someone sleeps on the boat.</p>
<p>Another option is to raft up to the sailing tour boat based here. It is run by <span>Saeed and his English-speaking collegue, Omar.</span></p>
<p><span>There is no electricity available, but water can be otained on request. For latest charges, see comments at bottom of page.</span></p>
<p>There is a good anchorage outside the harbour breakwater, in about 5m over a sandy bottom. Subject to some swell and, usually, a fairly strong breeze. In the winter, when the swell is often greater than 3m, this is not a safe anchorage. There is no charge for anchoring here, however some cruisers have reported being told to move into the harbour for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be left at the yacht dock. Yhe harbour master advised against leaving a dinghy there unattended over night.</p>
