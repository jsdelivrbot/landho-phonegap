<div class="hello"><div><p>A useful port on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, being just 220 NM from the Canaries. This is a reasonable stopping place with good provisioning in town and officials are reported to be friendly and efficient. Prices are very reasonable.</p>
<p>It is a good place from which to visit Marrakech and southern Morocco.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Entry procedures here can take time, in particular clearing out. Customs, Immigration and police are officially on  duty 24 hours at the marina, however cruisers have reported that in fact some of the authorities only work during daylight hours, and opening times be "flexible".</p>
<p>It's likely the authorities will come on board as soon you are are berthed  (although note that Customs don't work on Saturdays and Sundays). They are  friendly, efficient and require no more paperwork than elsewhere on the Moroccan  coast.</p>
<p>Papers must be originals and not copies.</p>
<p>The return of stamped passports can cause a delay as the stamp is kept in the main  port.</p>
<p>On departure, you will not be permitted to clear out the night before and depart at first light, you will have to wait until the offices open in the morning.</p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> Movement in this port is restricted. If you wish to go for a day-sail and anchor elsewhere, you will need to clear out, and clear back in again on return.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance to the marina is rather "hidden" and is towards the bathing beach,  NOT through the main harbour. Finding the entrance is difficult at night until you  are adjacent and it opens up.</p>
<p>There is reported to be plenty of space in the marina.</p>
<p>Alternatively, boats can anchor off the yacht club in the NE of the Grand Bassin,  which welcomes visitors. The dinghy can be left at the yacht club pontoon. Water  can be obtained at the same dock, which has sufficient depth at high tide.  Unfortunately, the harbour tends to be very dirty and polluted.</p>
