<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival at the port entrance behind the huge outer breakwater, call the port captain on VHF (CH 16, 11, 10).</p>
<p>Yachts can either proceed to the marina (if there is space) or anchor off the port and go by dinghy to visit the authorties.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency (storm, ill person, engine failure etc.) a yacht may be allowed to moor in the commercial harbour for a short period. Officials will come to the yacht; speaking French to them is a definite advantage and formalities are reported to be relatively straightforward.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrace is wide and well sheltered and safe to enter in all conditions. On arrival, try calling the marina on VHF, however it is unlikely they will answer. Instead, wait off the marina until the dock staff arrive and find a space for you.</p>
<p>You may have to anchor overnight to wait for a space. <span>The outside anchorage is large and sheltered in most conditions except N or NW winds.</span></p>
<p>The marina has two poontons with water and electricity. <span>The Marina staff are very helpful, there are good toilets/showers next to the pontoons and there is a weather office in the port with a helpful meteorologist. </span>The berthing fee also includes use of the yacht club nearby which has a pool.</p>
<p>Entering should not attempted at spring low-water as the concrete blocks for the moorings lower the depth between the pontoons significantly. However, once moored, drafts up to 2m are ok. <span>Space is tight and any manovering needs to be very slow. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The marina can accommodate boats up to 12 meters length and 2 meters draft and have four to five visitors berths. Advance reservation is not possible, however they</span><span> make every effort to accommodate all visiting yachts. There is a fuel berth with limited depth, best approached at high tide.</span></p>
<p>Leaving the boat in Mohammedia is absolutely safe as the port is very well guarded. <span>Day trips to Casablanca or further afield are possible by train.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that the marina is in the middle of a big industrial area, and the air is very polluted. The boat will be covered in soot by the time you leave.</span></p>

Old but with friendly staff and priced according to the Spanish Atlantic coast. 2 ton crane and hard standing, however for club members only.
