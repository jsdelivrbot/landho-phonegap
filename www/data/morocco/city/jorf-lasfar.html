<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a Port of Entry, although used primarily for the export of phosphates.</p>
<p>The office is in the "Capitanerie" basin (4th on the right, before the big dock). Raft up to a tug boat and go ahore for clearance.</p>
<p>Beware of errors on some charts regarding the position of both the port and the correct basin for yachts. Location is 33°7.45'N, 08°37.48'W.</p>
