<div class="hello"><div><p>Casablanca Yacht Club has been pulled down and the area is not accessible to yachts. The marina is currently being re-built and latest information December 2013 is that it's still not open; at present yachts do not seem to be welcome, even to anchor inside the breakwater wall as was previously possible. Contact the Port Authority before attempting to enter the port; they will probably advise to continue to Mohammmedia, 12 miles to the north.</p>
