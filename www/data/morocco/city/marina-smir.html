<div class="hello"><div><p>This marina development on the north African coast is just 25 miles from Gibraltar, just south of Ceuta on Morocco’s Mediterranean coast. It offers a secure and economical base for repairs, winter berthing (afloat or ashore) or generally cruising the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Marina Smir is pretty westernised and cruisers report that the normal Moroccan strictures about bare arms for women and shorts for men don’t seem to apply here. If in doubt dress cautiously first and then see what others are doing.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Formalities are relatively straightforward here as officials are used to dealing with yachts. Initially go alongside the Customs/fuel berth (to port just inside the entrance) and take your boat papers and passports up to the office.</p>
<p>No fees are charged.</p>
<p>Papers are not now normally retained by the Marina Office.</p>
<p>Ensure that you officially clear out before leaving the marina.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The entrance is seriously narrow due to the silting of the entrance, but it is buoyed.</p>
<p><span>Reception Pier immediately on Pt right in front of the conspicuous Marina-Office Tower and “around the corner” from the fuel station.</span></p>
<p>It is well protected from all weathers and with a good depth.</p>
<p>The Port Captain is said to be very helpful, speaking both Spanish and English.</p>
