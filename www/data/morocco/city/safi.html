<div class="hello"><div><p>Safi is a nice, clean city with a fascinating medina. Although there are no facilities for yachts, spares for fishing boats are available.</p>
<p>It should be noted however that corruption is an on-going problem here and cruisers who left their boat here while visiting Marakesh in May 2012, returned to find the boat had been entered and certain items stolen (see report adjacent). </p>
<p>It is recommended that cruisers only visit this port if absolutely necessary and do not leave their boat unattended.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Safi is a large commercial port and fishing harbour. Port control (CH 16) maintains 24 hour radio watch and will direct yachts where to berth for clearance (likely alongside another vessel). </p>
<p>Customs, police and immigration will come to the yacht; formalities are reported to be straightforward and officials courteous and efficient. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Safi has no marina, no facilities (water or electric), and berthing in the main port (most likely alongside a commercial vessel) will cost approximately double the rate of other Moroccan Marinas. </p>
<p>Although there is a controlled port gate and passes are needed by yacht crew to come and go, entrance is widely granted as people go to the fishing port. Security is therefore not as good as it may seem.</p>
<p>Fuel can be brought to the boat by one of the locals, however prices will be approximately 50% more than the norm and a "gift" will be required.  </p>
<p>Be warned that the harbour master and harbour personnel will ask for baksheesh. It is not recommended to leave your boat unattended here. </p>
