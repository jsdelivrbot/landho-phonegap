<div class="hello"><div><p>This purpose built marina development on the North African Moroccan coast is 33 nm east of Melilla and 6 nm west of the Algerian border.</p>
<p>The marina is located 4 nm west of the town of Saidia and the breakwater is visible in clear weather, the entrance faces east, and will come into view when close. Depths at the entrance vary, and there might be some silting, approach with some caution. There is also some silting inside the marina; the shallow areas are clearly marked. <span>After passing through the outer basin, you’ll turn left and will see red balls marking BOTH sides of the channel to the inner harbour. The Quai d’Accueil/Welcome dock is on your right as you enter. This harbour is very secure.</span></p>
<p>The planned marina development for 850 boats never quite materialised with only one third of the marina being utilised, and the marina now has an unfinished, abandoned air about it. It is however<span> well protected from all weather with virtually no chance of any swell within the marina.</span></p>
<p><span>Its close proximity to Spain yet being out of the EU means it is a useful place to visit for VAT or Schengen purposes. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Saidia is a port of entry.</p>
<p>See <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Morocco?rc=Formalities">Morocco Formalities</a></b> for full details on clearing in and out and permitted length of stay.</p>
<p><span>All the authorities are conveniently located right at the marina office and the welcome dock.  The Customs officials will come to your boat, make a brief inspection and ask if you have any firearms. Then you go to the office to fill out all the paperwork. </span><span>Immigration officials will take the passports to make copies and then return them an hour or so later.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s very helpful if you speak French, although some English is spoken. </span><span>Officials are reported to be polite, courteous and professional and c</span><span>ruisers report there is no hint of baksheesh here.</span></p>
<p>Only the captain is allowed ashore until the clearance process is completed.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/SaidiaMarina.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>The marina here opened in 2007. It<span> is surrounded by restaurants and bars, however despite that much of the pontoons are not used and the marina is now rather neglected. Pontoons are not secured, but security guards patrol the entire marina 24 hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span>Marina personnel will indicate the berth to use. Mooring is bow or stern to with lazy lines, but with only a few boats in the marina it is also possible to moor alongside. Water and power is available at every berth. <span>The electrical outlets on the first 2 pontoons are 32A, so most boats will need an adapter. The 3rd pontoon in has smaller 16A plugs. </span>Bathrooms are basic.</span></p>
<p><span>Charges are very low – 11 euro per day for a 14 meter boat, including power, water and VAT. WiFi is good but at extra cost. During high season – July and August - costs are 60 percent higher.</span></p>
<p>The fuel dock accepts cash only, no credit card. They do sometimes run out of diesel fuel so enquire about availability on arrival.</p>
<p>The marina itself accepts credit cards, but apparently they don’t always work.</p>
<p><span></span><span>There is a reasonably well stocked supermarket in the marina although most of the other store fronts are empty, and there are 3 ATMs are on site (although all may not work).</span></p>
<p><span><span>The large town of Saidia is a 10 minute bus ride away.</span></span></p>
