<ul>
<li>The Guyana coast is characterised by shallow and muddy waters so care should be taken, although with the help of a cruising guide it makes a fascinating destination. An added attraction is that Guyana is outside the hurricane belt.</li>
<li>Using the rivers to visit the interior takes you right into the heart of the Amazon rain forest. With Bartica now a Port of Entry, the River Essequibo makes a particularly attractive destination and is popular with visiting cruising yachts. The river Berbice is navigable for 100 miles (160 km) past the port of New Amsterdam and is also possible to take keeled boats up the rivers Pomeroon, Waini and Raima.</li>
<li>The capital Georgetown is a dirty, bustling port with no facilities for yachts. On the right bank of the river Demerara, the town has nineteenth century houses on stilts and boulevards built along disused Dutch canals. Seawalls and dykes protect the town, which is built on an alluvial flat area below the highwater mark. If electing to anchor in the Demerara River the yacht should not be left unattended.</li>
<li>The Official language is English (often with a creole flavour).</li>

<div><p>As in many South American countries, armed robbery and violent crime does occur. The UK Foreign Office recommend exercising caution when travelling in Guyana, however most visits are trouble-free. The local authorities have been working hard over the last few years to improve the security situation for visiting yachts and are keen to develop yachting tourism.</p>
<p>Currently however (August 2014) fishermen in and around the <span>Corentyne River (which is the border between Guyana and Suriname) are being violently attacked by pirates and losing anchors and fishing gear. This area should be avoided.</span></p>
<p>Georgetown is notorious for petty street crime. Do not walk alone at night, or even during the day. Whilst no reports of attacks on cruising yachts have been received, pirates attacked a number of fishing vessels in Feburary 2012 in the Pomeroon River just off the village of Cozier.</p>
<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>) gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go.</p>
<p>Should you have information about a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>
