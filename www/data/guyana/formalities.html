<div><p><span>Bartica is the preferred clearance port for Guyana. It is advisable to let the Coastguard on Fort Island (Tel. 592 600 6510 know you are in Guyanan waters. A</span><span>t Bartica there is an office which has been set up with cruisers in mind. Customs, Immigration and Health authorities are all based there and the paperwork is simple and quick. No agent is required.</span></p>
<p><span>It is possible, but not advisable, to clear in at Georgetown (about 7nm SE of the Essequibo river). T</span>he berthing and anchoring facilities in Demerara harbour are not suitable for yachts.</p>
<p>If checking in at Parika, anchor off Roeden Rust and take the dinghy to the town. This is rather an exposed anchorage as you have to anchor well off the shore to avoid the sand banks.</p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Guyana is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
