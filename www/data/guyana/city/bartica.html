<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/bartica_SBS.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Bartica is a mining terminus town in the heart of the rain forest, 40 miles up the River Essequibo where it is joined by the Mazuruni river. It is becoming more widely known as a cruising destination and most services can be found here. However, other than for supplies there is little to keep yachts here.</p>
<p>Entering the river Essequibo on a rising tide in order to safely clear the shifting sand bar at the entrance, is recommended. Also beware of the strength of the tidal stream in the river as it can reach over 3.5kn on the ebb. Entry can be made from either the Main Channel (East) or the Western Channel (with local knowledge). Night entry should be avoided because of unlit fishing obstructions placed across the marked channel.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p><span>Following a number of attacks by armed criminal gangs in Spring 2008, Bartica has undergone a dramatic change in the past few years and cruisers report it is now a relatively safe place. Violent crime has been controlled and incidents are now rare. Normal security precautions as pertain to the Caribbean or Brazil should be adhered to.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Full clearance facilities are now in place at Bartica and clearance is simple and straightforward. You do not require an agent.</p>
<p>The first big wharf you encounter as you arrive off Bartica is the Transport &amp; Harbours Department Stelling, “Welcome to Bartica”. Directly behind the Stelling on the main road (First Street) is the Police Station and here you will see the Immigration Police office. Once you have completed formalities here the officer will direct you to the Customs Office <span>above Church's Chicken just across the road from the Police Station.</span></p>
<p><i>Checking out:</i> First visit the Immigration Police who will then accompany you to the Custom Office, here there is a small payment required.</p>
<p>Remember to observe the dress code.</p>
<p>If choosing to anchor at the river mouth before heading up river, everyone should remain on board and must clear Customs at Bartica before landing.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several "resorts" where yachts can anchor close by. None are particularly commercial and each offers different views of the local wildlife; exotic birds and butterflies, sloths, parrots, monkeys etc.</p>
<p>In particular, Hurakabra, Banganara and Shanklands are very welcoming, helpful and offer a range of facilities. Banganara is the only one open over the Christmas holiday period. Hurakabra (see below) is run <span>by Gem and Kit Nascimento - key players in re-opening the Bartica facility for customs and immigration. They offer a great many services for cruising boats.</span></p>
<p><span><img class="image-inline" src="Countries/KAKAatHurakabra_sized.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/></span></p>
<p>One thing to remember is that the afternoon rain storms are often accompanied by wind of F5 or more, although the anchorages in the river are safe and the holding is good.</p>
<p>Medium sized coastal traders and large tug/barge combinations navigate the River past Bartica. When anchoring off Bartica ensure you are well clear of the channel and are well lit at night.</p>
<p>Owners of The Cool Breeze Bar are happy to let you use their dock for you dinghy.</p>
