<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying just inside the entrance to the <span>Essequibo River, this small town is a centre for both river and land transport. Its Sunday markets are an attraction.</span></p>
<p>Position 6°52′N, 58°25′W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is advisable to clear in at <span>Bartica. See <a href="../Bartica"><strong>Noonsite/Countries/Guyana/Bartica</strong></a> for the details.</span></p>
<p>However, this is a Port of Entry although the officials are not always present. It is necessary to anchor some way out into the river to avoid the sand banks and the local ferry traffic. An idea spot is about 150m off the end of the pier at Roeden Rust marina (no facilities here).</p>
<p>Take the dinghy to the steps, taking care to leave it on a long line as the tidal range can be up to 4m. All the crew, (together passports and ships papers) need to go ashore to visit Customs and Immigration in Parika. A taxi to take you into the town will cost about 100<span>Guy$ per person.</span></p>
<p>From the cross roads in Parika, the Police Station and Immigration Dept are on your left just before you reach the pier. Ask for a 3 month visa as it will be easier than having to go to Georgetown later for an extension. You will then be directed to Customs. Get a copy of this form as one will be required when you clear out.</p>
