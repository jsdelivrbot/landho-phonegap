<ul>
<li>Monaco is a small independent principality lying on the southern coast of France, surrounded by the French department of the Alpes Maritimes. The principality is a prosperous tourist and business centre, with low taxes and no income tax. </li>
<li>A full range of services is available in the main port, where several workshops are located on its south side. The latter is geared more to dealing with large yachts, so cruising boats may find Fontvielle less intimidating.</li>
