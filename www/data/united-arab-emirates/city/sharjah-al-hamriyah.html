<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Sharjah is the third largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates and the cultural capital of the Arab World as declared by the UNESCO in 1998. <span> It is located between Dubai and Ras Al Khaima interrupted by a part of Ajman. It is <span>76 Kilometers away from Abu Dhabi the capital of the United Arab Emirates. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The port of Al Hamriyah is a free zone. </span></span></span><span>Hamriyah is an industrial port serving the oil industry – it is jam-packed with oil support vessels and you would only want to consider berthing here if arranging a lift out with the Riviera Yard. Berthing would be on a strictly temporary basis before or after liftout. The only services for yachts are at the Riviera yard which is mostly concerned with building and servicing large motor superyachts.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Prior approval should be obtained before coming here, however, there are a huge number of skilled trades available within the free zone and major maintenance work is possible here.</span></p></div></div>
