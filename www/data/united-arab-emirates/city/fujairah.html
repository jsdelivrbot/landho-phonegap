<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a new marina here, together with a magnificent clubhouse, bar and restaurant. Apart from during December, when an annual power boat race is hosted here, there are plenty of berths for visitors, who are made most welcome. Rates are reasonable and the management act as clearing agent with no additional charge. Security is excellent.</p>
<p>Fujairah is a commercial port and has no facilities for hauling out yachts. Dubai is a better base for such work and repairs.</p></div></div>
