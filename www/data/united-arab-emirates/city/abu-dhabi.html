<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a big commercial port, but there are many marinas here mainly catering 
for power boats, of which there are a large number here.</p>
<p>The area of Al Bateen, to the west of the city centre, has several harbours and 
marinas and is close to the open sea.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi fishing harbour is a colourful, if crowded destination. It lies 
just south of the commercial docks, to the east of the city.</p>
<p>If wishing to find a quieter location, it is possible to enter the the Abu Dhabi 
inter-coastal waterway at Mina Zayad, passing under the new Saadiyat bridge.</p>
<p>If you are a motor racing fan, then wending your way for about 8nm to the new 
Yas Southern marina would be an ideal destination as it is adjacent to the new 
racing circuit. It is important to follow the marked channel as there are 
shallow patches. See <a href="http://www.yasisland.ae/en/visiting/yas-">www.yasisland.ae</a>
island-maps-and-directions/ for detailed directions. This marina is now managed 
by Camper &amp; Nicholsons and has recently added additional berths.</p>
<p>Several more marinas are planned for the Yas cays area of the waterways.</p>
<p>Last updated September 2012.</p>
