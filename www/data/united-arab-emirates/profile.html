                Facts
                
                
            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>The UAE is a federation of seven independent states, with coastlines on the Persian Gulf and the  Gulf of Oman. Abu Dhabi is the largest. Dubai, Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Qaiwain are known as the Northern States. The interior is mainly desert; most of the 2 million inhabitants live along the coast or in inland oases. </li>
<li>Although cruising opportunities are very limited, a small number of foreign yachts venture into the area every year. As there are a number of locally owned yachts, mainly power, facilities are of a good standard and the large expatriate Indian workforce means that major repairs can be done cheaply. The cost of labour is cheap and the work if properly supervised, is normally done to a high standard.</li>
<li>There is very little bureaucracy, for most nationalities the entry visa is free. Food, fresh and tinned, petrol and diesel are all well priced  and there’s no tax on imported sailing goods. </li>
<li>There are a number of marinas in Dubai, including one at the Dubai Golf and Yacht Club by the town centre, which can only be reached when the bridge over the creek opens. About 3 miles west of the town is the Dubai Offshore Sailing Club. Right in the centre is the <span>Dubai International Marine Club and there is a major marina opening soon on the Jumeirah Palm development.</span></li>
