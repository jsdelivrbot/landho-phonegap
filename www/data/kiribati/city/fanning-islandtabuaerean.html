<div class="hello"><div><p>Fanning is one of the island atolls in the Line Island Group <span>with a maximum elevation of approx. 3 m (10 ft) above high tide.</span> It is a useful stop if proceeding to Hawaii, some 900 miles away.  The island is situated directly in the <b><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone">ITCZ</a></b>.</p>
<p>Position 3°51.4’N, 159°21.5’W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>If no officials come out to inspect the yacht, the captain should disembark and visit first Customs in the government offices just south of the jetty, then the chief of police who also acts as Immigration officer.</p>
<p>There is a AUS$20 per three month anchoring fee as well as some clearance fees. Only Australian and US dollars are accepted, and there are no banks or ATMS.</p>
<p>Beware of being asked to pay extra fees for no reason.</p>
<p>A video and audio documentary on Fanning is available at <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/fanningisland"><b>www.cdbaby.com/fanningisland</b></a></p>
<p>Landing supplies for local families is permitted, but must be cleared with the customs official first and the duty paid. Alternatively, such gifts can be quietly given out on your boat.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a wide pass on the west side of Tabuaeran atoll, but there is a strong outflowing current at maximum ebb (up to 7 knots). One should time one's arrival to coincide with slack water. <span>There are now </span><strong>no buoys</strong><span> marking the entrance to the pass. </span></p>
<p><span>Once through the pass in the lagoon, moor to the old sunken barge on the north side, or to either of the two mooring buoys. This is a more sheltered spot in stronger winds.</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, anchor in 30 ft of sand and coral off the main village of Napia, south of the pass. This is the preferred position for clearing in.</span></p>
<p>It is<span> </span><span>possible to anchor in the lee of the island, in shallow sand. Holding is patchy. </span></p>
