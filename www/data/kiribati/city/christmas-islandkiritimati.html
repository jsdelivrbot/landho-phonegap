<div class="hello"><div><p>Kiritimati<span> (</span>sometimes Christmas Island) is a Pacific Ocean raised coral atoll in the northern Line Islands, and part of the Republic of Kiribati.</p>
<p>The name "Kiritimati" is a rather straightforward respelling of the English word "Christmas" in the Kiribati language.</p>
<p>The island has the greatest land area of any coral atoll in the world, about 388 square kilometres, its lagoon is roughly the same size. Abundant in wildlife and very popular with bone fisherman, Kiritimati is very beautiful and very isolated.</p>
<p>Position 1° 55"29'N, 157° 26"W</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Kiribati?rc=Formalities">Kiribati Formalities</a></strong> for full details on clearing into and out of Kiribati.</p>
<p>On approach, call <span><span>Marine Radio Christmas Island</span></span> (Tango 3 Charlie) on VHF 16 to arrange clearance.</p>
<p>Officials will want to come to your boat for inward clearance (you will have to collect them in your dinghy from the commercial pier). <span> It is better to transport them in one's own dinghy as a high price will be demanded for the launch service.</span></p>
<p>Be sure to arrive with a zarpe from your last port of call (or you will be fined) and don't arrive at weekends as you will be charged double for overtime.</p>
<p>The Customs, Immigration and quarantine offices are all close together in town (called London). Bear in mind however that there are no taxis or hire cars and the local bus service is very erratic, so you will need to plan ahead when checking out.</p>
<p>There is no real telephone system here in Kiritimati, so most use VHF radio to communicate.</p>
<p>Firearms are taken ashore and locked up at the police station until departure.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The pass into the lagoon is difficult to locate and can get silted up.</p>
<p>The best anchorage (GPS 1°59.08'N 157°28.83'W) is west of London, the main settlement, just off the tennis and basketball court, which is occasionally lit at night.</p>
<p>Cruisers also recommend anchoring off the Copra Harbour (see comment at bottom of page).</p>
<p><span>Anchoring in anything less than 10 metres of water is not advisable as it could place you in the surf zone if winds and sea state were to change. </span><span>The anchorage is open to winter swells from the north and west and swells may arrive without any warning. In January 2004 surf with face heights in excess of 30 feet was reported in the anchorage by a local yacht.</span></p>
<p><span>The commercial pier is rather rickety, but it does have a floating platform that tenders can tie to.  Climbing up the stairs from the dinghy dock can test those who have a fear of heights! </span></p>
