<div><p><strong>No other island must be visited before clearing in or after clearing out.</strong></p>
<p>Call the appropriate port Radio on VHF 16 on arrival in Kiribati waters (Tarawa Radio, Christmas Radio, Fanning Radio or Kanton Radio). It will be necessary to collect the officials in your own dinghy.</p>
<p>A cruising permit should be obtained when clearing in.</p>
<p>You must report to the local police on any island you visit after clearing in to the country; some atolls have a Quarantine officer who may wish to inspect the yacht.</p>
<p><span>To visit other islands during your stay in Kiribati you will need to write a letter to Principal Immigration Officer requesting permission - at least 3 days prior to intended departure. You will also need to clear with customs to visit other islands. They will provide you with a letter of introduction to give to the local police on arrival, who will want to see your permit letter and crew passports.</span></p>
<p><span>Permission to visit one of the outer islands is granted for a fixed period, usually no more than 2 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that the outward clearance policy has changed and it is no longer necessary for all yachts to return to Tarawa for final outward clearance. Yachts have reported being able to clear out of Christmas Island in 2015. Remember that yachts are not allowed to stop at any of the outer islands after making final outward clearance.</span></p>

<p>Before clearing out, yachts must pay their port dues of <span>AUS$50 per month, payable at the KPA office (ports office). </span><span>The receipt for which is required by Customs before the departure clearance document is issued.</span></p>

<div><p>In order to visit any other islands after clearing out, one needs to obtain an official letter from Customs and Immigration. A letter will be issued addressed to the relevant official at each island, stating, among other things, the duration of one's allowed stop. It is therefore essential not only to obtain this letter before clearing out, but also to ensure that one's visa covers the entire proposed stay.</p></div>
