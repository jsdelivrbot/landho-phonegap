<ul>
<li>Isolated in the North Atlantic with Greenland its only neighbour, Iceland consists of one main island and numerous smaller ones. Visited by only the most intrepid yachts during its short summer, a passage to Iceland and a cruise along its rugged coasts offers an experience difficult to match anywhere else in the North Atlantic.</li>
<li>Although there are not many local yachts, repair facilities are relatively good, particularly in active fishing harbours such as Reykjavik, Isafjördur and Olafsvik. Reykjavik and Keflavik are the most frequented in Iceland, although visiting yachts are few in number.</li>
<li>The authorities are keen to encourage yachts to visit.</li>
<li>A feature along the Icelandic shores are orange huts, set up as refuges for shipwrecked sailors. Every hut has some emergency supplies and a radio telephone.</li>
<li>Although a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland is not a member of the EU.</li>

<div><p>In spite of the closeness to the Arctic Circle, the climate is not too harsh and winters are relatively mild, mainly because of the warming waters of the Gulf Stream. The average temperatures are 10°C in summer and 1°C in winter. Prevailing winds are from the SE or E. Summer winds are often light and calms are common.</p>
