<div><ul>
<li>This small, former Portuguese colony, lies on Africa's west coast, south of Senegal. It is very poor and riven with civil wars.</li>
<li>Its ligitmate economy depends on the production of cashew and ground nuts, but it is also a major hub for cocaine smuggled from Latin America to Europe.</li>
<li>The 150 miles of coastline is much indented with numerous river entrances, most of which are shallow. The major estuary is that of Geba River on which lies the capital and principal port of Bissau.</li>
<li>The off-lying islands of the Bijagos Archipelago, one of which forms the Orango National Park, are rich in all types of fish and wildlife - a real unspoilt paradise. Navigation requires great care because of strong currents and shallow water. A shallow keeled boat and careful planinng is required.  See <a href="Countries/Guinea-Bissau/?rc=GeneralInfo#Links">links</a> for a useful cruising guide to this area.</li>
<li>It is necessary to be completely self-sufficent when cruising the Archipelago as nothing is available. For navigation, the British Admiralty charts are good and surprisingly accurate except for sand banks that may have moved. Electronic charts based on them are also good.</li>
<li>Only a small proportion of the population speak the official language, Portuguese. Just less than half speak Kriol, a Portuguese-based creole language, and the remainder speak native African languages. French is taught in schools.</li>
