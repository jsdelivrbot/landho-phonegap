<p>The Harbour Master is in the government building near the pier. Hours are 0600-1800 Monday to Saturday. You can check in and out at the same time, even if staying a few days.</p>
<p>In bad weather it may be necessary to carry on to the more protected anchoring area on the NW side of the island, between Ladder Bay and Well's Bay, where several moorings (yellow with blue stripe) have been laid for visiting yachts. From here, Fort Bay is best reached by dinghy.</p>
