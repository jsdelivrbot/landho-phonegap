<div class="hello"><div><p>The visitor moorings are yellow with a blue stripe and are checked regularly by park staff to ensure your safety, as well as to protect the pristine marine environment.</p>
<p>The 11 moorings are available on a first-come first-served basis. The mooring fee is $3US per person/per week.  There is also a park administration fee, called a "Nature Fee" of $1US per person/per night. (2015)</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong></p>
<p>From the anchorage at Well’s and Ladder Bays to the Fort Bay dinghy dock is almost a 2nm dinghy ride. Note you must stay 150 metres offshore of any dive boats moored in the area, so it is a wet ride.</p>
<p>If conditions are very calm, an alternative way of getting ashore is to climb "The Ladder", an 800-step stairway leading from the small rocky beach at Ladder Bay up to the top of the island where there is the village "The Bottom". Before the 1940s, The Ladder was the only way to get goods and people to the villages at the top of the island.</p>
<p>From The Bottom, take a taxi up the steep winding narrow road to the main town of Windwardside. Here there is a tourist office, restaurants, guest houses and dive shops.</p>
