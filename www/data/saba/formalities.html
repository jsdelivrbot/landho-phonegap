<div><p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Saba is an area of interest. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>
