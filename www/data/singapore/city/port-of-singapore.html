<div class="hello"><div><p>The <b><i>Keppel Bay Marina</i></b> is part of a new development near the old commercial port of Keppel Harbour, based on Keppel island which is now attached to the mainland. The final phase of the build was recently completed. The staff are helpful and it is close to downtown.</p>
<p><b><i>One15 Marina</i></b> is even newer and is located on the southern shore of Sentosa Island. Not an ideal place for doing repairs, but a comfortable berth in which to stay.  Sentosa Island is now a popular resort, with numerous theme parks and attractions.</p>
<p><b><i>Raffles Marina</i></b>, in Tuas, on the west side of the island, is located adjacent to the Second Link Bridge connecting Singapore and Malaysia. It is the best place if needing to get repairs. The one great disadvantage of Raffles Marina is that it is an hour's travel time from downtown Singapore. Clearance is no longer possible at this marina.</p>
<p>Several new marinas have opened in the proximity of Singapore:-<br/> <strong><a href="Countries/Malaysia/SebanaCove?rs=Docking#SebanaCoveMarina"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="Countries/Malaysia/SebanaCove?rs=Docking#SebanaCoveMarina"><i>Sebana Cove</i></a></strong> is located on the banks of the Sebana river on the south coast of Malaysia. A five star resort with a marina.<br/> <strong><a href="Countries/Indonesia/NongsaPointMarina?rs=Docking#NongsaPointMarina"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="Countries/Indonesia/NongsaPointMarina?rs=Docking#NongsaPointMarina"><i>Nongsa Point Marina</i></a></strong> is located on the northern shore of Batam Island, in Indonesia. To visit Nongsa Pont Marina yachts require a "green book". For Singapore-based boats the green book replaces the cumbersome sailing permit but the formalities for getting the book are just as lengthy and only Singapore-based boats bother to get it.<br/><strong><a href="Countries/Malaysia/JohorBahru/?showAllEntries=1&amp;rc=PortProfile#Docking"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="Countries/Malaysia/JohorBahru/?showAllEntries=1&amp;rc=PortProfile#Docking"><i>Danga Bay Marina</i></a></strong> is at Johor Bahru on the Malaysian shore.</p>
<p>The <b><i>SAF yacht club</i></b> has 2 clubhouses, with berthing, at various locations around Singapore. See below and <a href="countries/Singapore/Changi"><strong>Changi</strong></a></p>
