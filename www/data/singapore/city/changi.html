<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Those on a limited budget usually anchor as close to the Changi Sailing Club as they can, as the Club rarely has any spare moorings. Do not anchor in the mooring field.</span></p>
<p><span> Changi is popular as it has a village atmosphere, a fresh produce market, restaurants, good shopping and other facilities within walking distance.</span></p>
<p>There is no marina here, but cruisers report that The Changi Sailing Club (CSC) is very welcoming to yachts in transit. CSC facilities are superb and the staff are helpful and friendly.</p>
