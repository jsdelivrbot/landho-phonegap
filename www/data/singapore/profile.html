<div><ul>
<li>Singapore is an island-state lying at the southern end of the Malay peninsula and linked to the mainland by a long causeway.</li>
<li>Duty-free shopping is no longer the attraction it was, as prices for electronics are both higher than elsewhere and often not covered by an international warranty.</li>
<li>For sailors arriving in Singapore after a lengthy cruise, often in undeveloped areas, this clean, well organised city has its attractions and is a convenient stop for provisioning and essential services.</li>
<li>There are repair facilities at Raffles Marina and Changi, however prices are very high and it is not the easiest place in which to coordinate complete or complex overhauls. Malaysian yards are a more economical option.</li>
<li>A new <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Singapore?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Immigration</a></b> system came into force April 1, 2016, which now means that an agent must be used by all international arrivals and departures.</li>

<div><p>The climate is hot and humid all year round with heavy rainfall especially November to January. Singapore is not affected by tropical storms and the only violent winds are the sumatras, which are strong, short-lived squalls that occur between April and November. Throughout the year the winds are light and there are frequent calms.</p>
