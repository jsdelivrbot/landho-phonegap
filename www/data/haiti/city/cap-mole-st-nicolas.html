<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage off the town is about 7m and can be exposed in northerly winds. Further into the inlet is very secure and sheltered  but is much further from the town and it is not wise to leave the boat unattended here.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage which is sheltered from the north can be found off the very welcoming fishing village of <span>Bombardopolis. It lies about 10 miles south of Cap Mole.</span></p>
