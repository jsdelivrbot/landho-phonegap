<div class="hello"><div><p>Rabaul lies on the northern tip of New Britain at the foot of <span>Mount Tavurvur volcano. The latest volcanic eruption occurred on 29 August 2014. It's </span><span>the largest town on the island of New Britain.</span></p>
<p><span>T<span>he harbour that made the area so attractive as a port when it was first settled by German colonists, was actually formed when the sea partially flooded the caldera after a cataclysmic eruption about 1,400 years ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sadly, t<span>he town of Rabaul has been paying for the mistake ever since. In 1937, an explosive eruption from Mount Tavurvur obliterated much of the town, killing 500 people in the process. In 1994 Mount Tavurvur <span> and another nearby volcano Mount Vulcan, </span>burst to life simultaneously. A quick evacuation plan meant that just five people lost their lives, but so much ash piled up on buildings that about two-thirds of the town was destroyed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Once called "The Pearl of the Pacific" the volcanic eruptions in 1994 and 2014 have turned it into something more like Pompeii. Very little of the original town remains and there is plenty of thick volcanic ash, however the locals are said to be extremely friendly and the yacht club very welcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Security: </strong>Local advice remains that anchorage at Rabaul cannot be recommended unless using the yacht club moorings. Night time anchoring in Kokopo off the resorts should also be treated with caution as boardings and thefts continue to be reported from here. The Duke of York Islands, close to Kokopo, have several good anchorages, with local villagers keen to ensure the safety of their island group for travelling yachts.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is very important that yachts follow the proper procedure for clearing into PNG through Rabaul. For full details on clearing into and out of PNG see<b><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities"> PNG Formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p><span>Drop anchor <span>just off the yacht club (it is to the right of the main wharf as you enter the harbour).</span></span></p>
<p><span>Then call <span>"Rabaul Harbour Control" on VHF16. They will advise you when to expect the Qu<span>arantine and Health officials. Watch the shore for their arrival and collect them in your dinghy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Then clear with Customs in Kokopo (<span>the new capital 18 miles down the coast)</span>. It is necessary to take a bus (no. 8) to the market in Kokopo. <span>Customs are located just off the Rabaul-Kokopo-Road. Opposite the WestPac-Building is a Brian Bell hardware store. Just to the right of this is the road for Customs, walk 50m down the road to the plaza on your left with the customs offices as well as a catholic book store.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Immigration is located at the airport. If they are not around, it may be necessary to ask the Customs there to contact them for you. Everyone is very friendly but patience is required.</span></p>
<p><span>The Yacht Club will be able to assistance with the clearance procedure, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>It is now possible for yachtsmen to obtain a visa on arrival when entering the country here.</span></p>
<p><span>Rabaul is the official Port of Entry, not Kokopo. Do not move the yacht there to complete clearance.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Simpsom Harbour is still one of the best havens in PNG, but due to volcanic activity, it is advisable to enter in daylight. The Yacht Club has a number of moorings available for visitors.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that security here is a little better than when anchoring off the 'new town' at Kokopo. There have been  boardings and robberies there in recent times.</p>
<p>The Duke of York Islands, close to Kokopo, have several good anchorages, with local villagers keen to ensure the safety of their island group for travelling yachts. Plus, there are several good resorts here that provide secure anchorage and others moorings for cruisers.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The local yacht club is very welcoming and helpful and will advise on where to find various repair facilities. These are satisfactory and what cannot be obtained locally can be ordered from Australia, although it may take a week or longer. The club may also be able to provide information on the current volcano activity. Depending on the wind direction one can keep clear of any outfall, although you have to be alert at all times.</p></div></div>
