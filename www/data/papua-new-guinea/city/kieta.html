<div class="hello"><div><p>This town is on Bougainville Island with a well sheltered anchorage and access to limited provisions in Arawa township.</p>
<p>Peace has now been restored here and "Street crime" directed towards Europeans is extremely rare, unlike on mainland PNG, particularly Port Moresby. However, walking around Arawa township at night, or visiting the local bar there, is not recommended. There is some petty theft so basic precautions should be taken.</p>
<p>Walking around Arawa and Kieta you will see the effect of the crisis with most of the buildings still damaged or destroyed. The novel "Mr. Pip" was set in this area and a film adaptation will be made in 2011.</p>
<p>There are New Zealand police advisors at Arawa police station who can give you an update you on the latest security situation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> From 1st Jan 2015 the time zone for </span><b>Bougainville</b><span> is UTC+11</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchor at the main commercial port of Kieta and travel by truck over the hill to Arawa township. The customs/ immigration office is located in a residential
house some distance away from the business center. Customs will not come
to your boat and the customs officer is difficult to track down. The best
way is to start asking people "Where is Nancy?".</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at Keita is deep and well protected and was the sight of a thriving yacht club pre-crisis. The best place to anchor is in Kobuan Bay, off the old yacht club.</p>
<p>Do not travel to the other wharf area near Loloho (5km to the north). This is under the control of gangs involved in the illegal export of scrap metal.</p>
<p>There are no repair facilities. Fuel is available by jerry jug and water at the dock, but is only delivered in ship-sized hoses as this is a commercial port.</p>
