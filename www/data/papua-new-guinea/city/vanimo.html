<div class="hello"><div><p>Vanimo is about 20nm east of the border with Indonesia, on the north coast of the main island of Papua new Guinea. It is a typical border town with very little to recommend it, however, it is <span>possible to </span><span>get an Indonesian visa here.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The town has had security issues in the past so you need to take care both on land and on board. You may choose to arrive early and complete formalities within the day, so there is no need to stay overnight.</span></span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>For full details on clearing into and out of PNG see</span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities"> PNG Formalities</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>This is a port of entry, however clearance here can be frustrating as the various offices are widely spread and officials are not always where they are supposed to be!</p>
<p><strong>Customs</strong></p>
<p>E-mail Customs 24-48 hours in advance of your arrival.<br/>Patrick Kinavai - <strong><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:kinavaip@customs.gov.pg">kinavaip@customs.gov.pg</a></strong> <br/>Phone: 457 1192.</p>
<p><span>Customs are out of town, close to the airport in a little trading complex across the street from the airfield. Take a taxi to get there, as it is quite far (about 2 km) and usually very hot. Alternatively you can try asking the Harbour Master if he can request for Customs to come to you.</span></p>
<p><span>If you go to Customs first, they may stamp your passports for you, avoiding a trip to Immigration.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Immigration</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Immigration is at the airport (but not always!). Ask the Harbour Master or Customs to try and contact him first. A departure card is all that is needed and your passports will be stamped.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Indonesian Visa</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>The Indonesian Consulate is about a ten minutes walk from the dock.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If gettting an Indonesian visa here, the Indonesian consulate accept passport-sized photos printed in the copy shop on the other side of the road. The visa is supposed to take 24 hours to process, but if you apply with all the documents and pay the fees early in the morning, you may get your passports returned with the visa by the afternoon.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>They are closed on Friday afternoon so time your arrival Monday to Thursday if you want to leave in one day. Open at 09:00.</span></span></span></p>

                Docking
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The bay is large and shallow and reasonably well protected in SE trade winds. Holding is good in mud.</p>
<p>If staying the night the Harbour Master (<strong><a class="external-link" href="http://Levi.Langai@pngports.com.pg">Levi.Langai@pngports.com.pg</a></strong>) advises yachts to anchor as close to the dock as possible. This area is well lit on shore and in his opinion the safest position in the bay and in theory they have guards. If there is no ship, you can ask to actually tie to the dock.</p>
<p><span>Dinghies can be chained to the right of the dock, although it's probably advisable to chat to some locals and ask them to keep an eye on it. Watch out for low tide.</span></p>
<p><span>There is not very much in Vanimo, apart from an airport, a small commercial dock, a shop for medium-quality provisioning, a hardware store and an Indonesian consulate. Fresh produce is hard to find.</span></p>
<p><span>All the stores are close to the waterfront. There is also a bank with guarded ATM.</span></p>
