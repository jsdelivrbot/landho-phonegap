<p>Local man Felix deals with all clearing in formalities, customs, immigration and quarantine, however it has been reported (Sep 2009) that it is a lucky dip as to whether he is actually there when you arrive. Cruiser advise you ring first to let them know you are coming, Tel: 6421155.</p>
<p>It is important that all persons on board have visas before arriving. Fees are 50 Kina for Quarantine and a small amount for Customs. Clearing out of the country is free.</p>
