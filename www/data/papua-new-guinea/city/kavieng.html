<div class="hello"><div><p>Kavieng is the main port on New Ireland. The harbour is formed by three connecting islands and is very sheltered from the west and the east, but is exposed in northerly and southerly winds.</p>
<p><span>Gas, diesel, LPG refills, and provisions are available here. For yachts heading north for FSM, Palau, or points north, or coming south from FSM, Kavieng is a useful provisioning and refuelling stop.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Papua New Guinea Formalities</a></strong> for full details on clearing into and out of the country.</p>
<p><span>The Customs office is located up in town on Coronation Road, past the intersection with Tanga Street. There isn't any signage on the street front, but it is in the same complex as Origin Energy which is out the front. Just ask anyone inside the gates where the Customs Office is, and they will direct you.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Every vessel arriving in Kavieng is expected to clear in and out. Customs prefer </span><span>to be contacted 48 hours prior to your arrival and departure. This will often help speed up formalities </span><span>as it allows them to prepare the necessary paperwork in advance. </span></p>

<p><span>Documents required on arrival include: Inward Clearance (outward clearance from last port), passports, general declaration, crew list and port call list.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The safest anchorage is off the </span><strong>Nusa Island Retreat</strong><span>, in "the Duck Pond" (02 35.11S, 150 46.91 E), where there are people who are only too happy to keep an eye out for the many yachts that anchor there. </span><span>The villagers on Nusalik island where the resort is located are very friendly and keen to encourage yachts to visit.</span></p>
<p><span>Kavieng is an excellent place for reprovisioning, and if you have any issues with your engine or fridge, there are people here who can help. Prices tend to be high however as most goods are shipped from Australia.</span></p>
<p>Adam and Danielle Smith operated a yacht charter business here for many years. They left in May 2013, however are happy for cruisers to contact them with any questions they may have on sailing through the area. Email: <a href="mailto:smithdani.c@gmail.com" target="_blank"><strong>smithdani.c@gmail.com</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Most people here are friendly and helpful, but basic precautions should be taken and it is recommended not to leave the boat after sunset. If anchored off the resort, ask if they can provide a night watchman.</p>
