<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Nissan Island (half way between Bougainville and New Ireland) makes an excellent stopping point on a passage from Buka to Rabaul. The locals are very friendly and keen to trade and a yacht club with secure anchorage is in the process of being established here. </span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Southern passage approach waypoint:<br/> 04 30 288S,154 09 844E.<br/>From there head </span><span>directly to 04 30 190S, 154 10 258E. <br/>Turn to starboard and you can anchor in </span><span>front of the sandy beach and village or Y<span>otchibol.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The anchorage provides good shelter from both the SE trade winds and the NW monsoon winds. There is a good sandy bottom that holds the anchor well</span>, although in some places the bottom is patchy so it pays to find a sandy </span><span>spot and snorkel on your anchor to check it has dug in. </span></p>
<p><span><span>The people </span><span>here are extremely friendly and you will likely be surrounded by </span><span>canoes from the village on arrival. </span><span><span>The villagers are always keen to trade garden foods such as greens, fruits green coconuts and yams or sweet potatoes for rice, noodles or biscuits.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span><span>The Chief's name </span><span>is Patrick, he won't come out to your boat so it is polite to go into </span><span>the village to introduce yourself and sign his guest book. In years past up to 20 yachts a year have visited this Island, however few visit now.</span></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Nearby you will find the new Nissan Island Yacht Club (NIYC). This is where Australian Andrew Kilvert and his Papua New Guinean </span><span>wife Imelda Tokiapron live. You may see Andrew’s yacht anchored outside his property on the shore.</span></p>
<p><span><span>By far the most important service the NIYC offers is a secure mooring at the front of Yotchibol village. No visiting vessels will be bothered by opportunists trying to trick people into paying non-existent anchorage fees (as occurs in other places). The local villagers keep a careful watch over any boats in the  anchorage to make sure that no-one from another part of the island is straying too close.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span>The NIYC can also provide introductions to other atolls for those who are planning on spending time exploring the region and cultural tips on how to get by safely.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There is a WW2 road going from </span><span>one end of the island to the other and an airfield which is not </span><span>currently used as flights have stopped coming here. There is a mission </span><span>station on the far side of the lagoon where there is a store for basic </span><span>supplies. The Primary school is 30 minute walk away and well worth a </span><span>visit. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A lot of the villagers are keen fisherman and make their own </span><span>quite impressive spear guns. Snorkelling along </span><span>the drop-off is reported to be excellent with some big fish and lots of sharks.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span><span>The villagers are always keen to trade garden foods such as greens, fruits green coconuts and yams or sweet potatoes for rice, noodles or biscuits.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span><span>Green Islands are part of Bougainville and the locals sometimes travel </span><span>to Buka, a 2 hour journey via open boat with outboard. The island has </span><span>a Digicel tower..</span></span></span></p>

      Established by Andrew Kilvert and Imelda Tokiapron. The yacht club provides secure mooring at the front of Yotchibol village and has a good fresh water supply as well as showers.  They have a range of carpentry, mechanical and fibreglass tools available and a couple of retired diesel fitters who have carried out successful repairs to mechanical injector pumps on visiting yachts in the past. Internet service and daily weather forecasts.

Next stage is to lay moorings to protect the reef.
