<div class="hello"><div><p>Buka Island offers extensive sheltered cruising along its west coast, but the east coast is cliff. As a reminder to take care, a freighter (now abandoned) hit the barrier reef just north of Matsungan Island in April 2010 after losing engine power.</p>
<p>Buka has an airport and regular connections to Rabaul and Port Moresby.</p>
<p>Buka is still considered un-safe for cruising yachts, and if you are planning to visit be sure to find a reliable local who can boat-sit.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> From 1st Jan 2015 the time zone for </span><strong>Bougainville</strong><span> is UTC+11.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The best anchorage is between Sohano Island and Bougainville Island and is well sheltered from the trade winds (05 26 590, 154 40 203). The island is not labelled on C-map.</p>
<p>The easiest entrance is from the east. The Buka Passage can on rare occasions flow at up to 8kn creating large standing waves when wind opposes tide. The norm is anything between 1 and 3 knots of current. Best entrance is at slack water, but once through any waves near the channel marker posts, the passage is deep and easily navigable.</p>
<p>You can enter Buka from the west but this involves travelling past coral reefs and small islands. Fishing vessels do come through this way.</p>
<p><span>You can expect to be Buzzed by lots of PMV </span><span>boats as yachts stopping here are rare and the people are quite </span><span>curious. </span></p>
<p>Rather than take your dinghy to shore, simply wave down a PMV boat who will take you in for K2.</p>
