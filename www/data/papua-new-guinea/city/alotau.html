<p><span>Alotau is the capital of Milne Bay Province, in the south-east of Papua New Guinea. It is a quiet little town located on the northern shore of Milne Bay. </span>It is only 25 miles from Samarai and cruisers who visited in 2013 reported that it is well worth the trip.</p>
<p><span>It is a reasonably good place to re-provision.</span><span>The </span><span>National Canoe and Kundu festival, held the first week in November each year, is a great time to visit and to see their amazing sailing canoes. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Customs are reported to be friendly and professional. </span></p>
<p><span></span>The Port will respond to English on VHF Ch. 16. and will arrange your Customs and Quarantine check in.</p>
<p>There does not seem to be a problem is anchoring away from the town at, e,g, <span>Discovery Bay, Wagga Wagga village, and taking a boat across to clear in. Or at one of the excellent anchorages in the <span>Killerton Islands (about ten miles east of Alotou) and taking a local bus into the town.</span></span></p>
<p>Sara Mogis at Aloteau Customs is reported to be helpful in ensuring the necessary pre-arrival paperwork was done.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>One anchorage is right in front of the Alotau International Hotel in deep (100ft) water, and it is possible to use their beach as a landing spot and place to keep the dinghy.  The guards there will keep an eye on the dinghy and may be willing to keep an eye on your boat at anchor.  Ask before you fill your water jugs at the Hotel, but there is a public water tank near the craft market/wharf.  It’s a little exposed to afternoon winds but an amazing place from which to watch the festival action.</p>
<p>A more sheltered anchorage can be found a few miles west of the town opposite the Driftwood lodge. Here there is better protection, shallower depth, and great security.  A long walk or a taxi is needed to get to town.  If their dock is free they will let you tie up too.</p>
<p>Another anchorage is at <span>Discovery Bay, Wagga Wagga village, on the south side of Milne Bay. This is protected for all but <span> NW winds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>About ten miles east of Alotou are the <span>Killerton Islands which proved several excellent anchorages.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Anchoring in front of a village and getting friendly with a few people and talking to a village elder is a good idea if you are unsure about security.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
