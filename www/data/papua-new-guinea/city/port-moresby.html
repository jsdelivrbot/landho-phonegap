<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Morseby lies on the south western shore on the PNG mainland. It is the main point of entry into Papua New Guinea. The main business and shopping district lies about 3 miles (5km) from the coast.</p>
<p>Port Moresby<span> and </span><a class="external-link" href="Lae">Lae</a><span> have been particularly affected by the recent surge in criminality in PNG; however, the area around the yacht club in Port Moresby is relatively trouble-free.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>On arrival at Port Moresby there is now a new light on the NW side of the Basilik Pass, quick flashing red. The GPS position of the middle of the pass is 9.32.237 S, 147.07.961 E</p>
<p>The Customs office is in the commercial harbour south of the yacht club. Call the Yacht Club on VHF Ch 16 as they will assist with formalities.</p>
<p>It should now be possible for yachtsmen to be granted a visa on arrival when entry is made here. It may be necessary to visit Immigration at the airport or wait until the officers can visit the yacht.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Royal Papua Yacht Club has its own marina with 24-hour security, but most spaces are occupied by members' boats so berths are in short supply. However, visitors are welcome and every attempt is made to accommodate them or to allow the visitor to use the large work berth.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one may anchor in the "Duck Pond" which has a constant depth of three meters. The holding is excellent once the surface is penetrated &amp; the anchor is dug in. The bottom is a mixture of coral sand &amp; muddy clay.</p>
<p>If planning to anchor long term the RPYC recommend a fisherman anchor with chain rode, however CQRs &amp; various copies &amp; some of the newer anchors have been used successfully using chain rode for relative long term mooring.</p>
<p>Theft from boats at anchor (outboards lifted on deck but not locked) have been reported here. Be sure to secure all loose items on deck.</p>
<p>The Duck Pond is well protected by a groin but windage can have an effect. Guardinage services can be sourced through the yacht club.</p>
<p><b>December 2014:</b> There has been an upsurge in <span>opportunistic looting and armed robberies affected many parts of Port Moresby. Take extra care and remain vigilent.</span></p>
