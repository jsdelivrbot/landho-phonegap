<div class="hello"><div><p>Misima Island is located about 100nm due east of Port Moresby on the main island.</p>
<p>This is a larger settlement with many people who have migrated away from their clan/family. Consequently there is crime here and some cruisers have experienced burglaries.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Misima used to be a port of entry and may well be again in the future.</p>
<p>After the gold mine closed the Customs officer left Misima at the begining of 2006. However groups of yachts wanting to clear in together here may be able to arrange to fly the Customs officer from Samarie to complete clearance. There is already a quarantine officer here.</p>
<p>Alternatively, yachts should go to Alatao or to Samarai for clearance.</p>
