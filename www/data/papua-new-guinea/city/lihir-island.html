<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Located north east of New Ireland, Lihir Island is the site of a huge Lihir gold mine and is a port of clearance into PNG. This is a good place to clear in to PNG for boats coming from the Solomon Islands and by-passing Buka.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="../?rc=Formalities">Papua New Guinea Formalities</a></strong><span> for full details on clearing into and out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Every vessel arriving here is expected to clear in and out. Customs must be</span><span> contacted 48 hours prior to your arrival and departure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span>E-mail: </span><strong><a href="mailto:Lihir.Customs@newcrest.com.au" target="_blank">Lihir.Customs@newcrest.com.au</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Documents required on arrival include: Inward Clearance (outward clearance from last port), passports, general declaration, crew list and port call list.</p>

<p><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://mathias.vovore@newcrest.com.au"></a></strong></span><span>The check-in bay is located at 03 04.534S 152 38.012E. </span></p>
<p><span>Radio Port Control or the Harbour Master on </span><span>VHF16 an hour out and on close – they will advise customs of your arrival. </span></p>
<p><span>The anchorage is exposed </span><span>to SE winds and rolly/uncomfortable. There is a fishing boat buoy at the given GPS co-ordinates </span><span>which can be used if free, otherwise anchor in shallow water &lt;5m. </span></p>
<p><span>While there is a pier, it is rough and </span><span>you are better bringing officials to your boat than tying alongside – pick them up at the pier. Clearance </span><span>timing all depends on whether customs have other commercial shipping checking in. </span></p>
<p><span>Officials are </span><span>friendly and courteous.</span></p>
<p>Arrangements have to be in place prior to the arrival of a yacht into <strong>Londolovit</strong>, remembering that this Customs Office is purely for the operations of the Gold Mine, which is owned by Newcrest Mining.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Rather than anchoring at Luise Harbour or Londolovit - which both tend to be roly - it may be preferable to stop and anchor at Lakakot Bay, </span><span>where the now closed Lakakot </span><span>Bay Resort is located. </span></p>
<p><span>This small bay provides excellent shelter, but the entrance is narrow and you </span><span>will need good light to see the reef lining the entrance. (Approach waypoint 03 09 077S 152 33 435E).</span></p>
<p>Anchor at 03 09.032S 152 33.645E in 10m sand and coral.</p>
<p>The resort is owned by Mark Bassani - E-mail: <strong><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:mark.bassani301060@gmail.com">mark.bassani301060@gmail.com</a></strong>, who still lives here with his family but now runs another business. Email him in advance of your arrival.</p>
