<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour lies on the north coast of the main island. It <span>is a very pretty area with numerous anchorages available in the large harbour which is safe all year round.</span></p>
<p><strong>Security:<br/></strong><span>Madang is a popular stop with cruisers on their way to Indonesia, however security problems have increased here in the last 2 years, similar to those afflicting Lae and Port Moresby. A luxury motoryacht was boarded by thieves here in 2014 and a cruising yacht was boarded and attacked in Hansa Bay, October 2015.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Madang is landlocked and provides a sheltered harbour and good holding. The best anchorage is just west of the steamship slipway, at the southern end of the town.</p>
<p>A safe facility for boats is at the Jais Aben diving resort at Nagada Bay, where the boat can be left if touring inland.</p>
<p>Anchoring o<span>utside the Madang Club can get a little rolly during northerlies but there are plenty of options further in.</span></p>

      This is a safe place to moor. The floating pontoon here has been upgraded so that smaller yachts can tie up with permission. There are showers, toilets, fresh water, a good swap library, icy cold beer, a small bistro and the Club is within easy walking distance of the market, supermarkets and the local resort.
