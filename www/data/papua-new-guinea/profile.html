<div><ul>
<li>One of the most fascinating countries in the world, Papua New Guinea is  definitely best visited by cruising boat. This not only gives one the  opportunity to catch a glimpse of life in a society still following ancient  ways, but also avoids the lawlessness that has affected the large towns (on the  mainland) of this rich, but poorly managed, country. Outside of the main centres  life is little changed and by using common sense one should be able to avoid the  few hot spots of trouble (see security section below). </li>
<li>A cruise in Papua New Guinean waters has been for many people the highlight of  their world cruise, and if one chooses one's itinerary carefully it is a country  well worth visiting.</li>
<li>Over the years 1989-1997, the Bougainville region - in particular Bougainville Island - suffered great destruction of life and property during a civil war. Since the end of that period there has been a gradual  restoration of peace. The region is now self-governing but still a part of PNG,  and had an incident free presidential election in 2010. While there are some areas that are still no go (since June 2011, there have been a number of  violent incidents in Central and Southern Bougainville and the port of Buka is considered un-safe), the port of Kieta is safe and has customs, with a well sheltered anchorage and access to provisions.</li>
<li>Nissan Island (part of Bougainville to the north) is spectacular and welcomes cruisers visiting.</li>
<li>The Royal Papua Yacht Club in Port Moresby has its own secure marina and  welcomes visiting yachts. There are a large number of locally owned yachts in  Port Moresby, where facilities are generally good.</li>
<li>Rabaul, on New Britain Island, was always a popular spot among cruising  yachts, many of whom used to spend the cyclone season in its landlocked harbour,  which is the crater of a volcano. In recent years the town has suffered two  destructive volcanic eruptions, however it is trying to get back on its feet again and much of the reconstruction has been completed. Moorings are now available for visiting yachts.</li>
<li>Madang on the northern coast of New Guinea also has a well-protected harbour  in an area scattered with islands, reefs and lagoons. It has always been a  popular stop, especially for those yachts taking the route north of New Guinea  towards Indonesia (see Security below).</li>
<li>The best cruising in Papua New Guinea is found among the many islands to the  east of the main island, where islanders still live a peaceful life and sail  large traditional canoes for fishing and trading voyages. </li>
<li>Facilities in the smaller towns and outer islands are often basic. There are  small boatyards with their own slipways dotted about the country, so one is  never too far away should the need arise for some emergency repair. However, all  essential spares should be carried on board and one should also provision the  boat in one of the major centres before sailing to the islands, where little  except a few locally grown vegetables is available.</li>
<li>Situated in the centre of the Asia-Pacific region, surrounded by the Coral,  Bismarck and Solomon Seas, whose constant movements feed and enrich the marine  environment, PNG has twice as many marine species as the waters of the Red Sea  and an estimated 10 times as many as the Caribbean. Its diving has been rated  the Top Dive Destination in the World in Rodale’s Scuba Diving Readers Choice  Awards.</li>

            </h2>
<div><p><strong>General Advice</strong></p>
<p>It is important to check the latest security situation here using such sites as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/papua-new-guinea"><strong>U.K. FCO</strong></a>.</p>
<p>PNG has a high violent crime rate against both locals and foreigners. In recent  years, the violence and unrest on the mainland appears to have spread  to some of the previously untouched, outlying islands. Some of the areas where  cruisers have experienced crime towards yachts are detailed below, and in the  main these do tend to be armed and violent. Remember that you are a  conspicuously rich visitor in a poor neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In general, it is best to avoid <span>any place large enough to have people who migrate there away from their clan/extended </span>family (such as Madang, Port Moresby and Lae - predominantly mainland PNG)<span>. There is no dependable </span>rule<span> of law and the traditional system keeps people in check in small communities. Many can't find work in the towns and life becomes even more desperate. </span></p>
<p><span><span> As with any travel in PNG you must remain vigilant at all times. Be sure to lock everything, keep your eyes open to trouble and do not walk around at night. When at anchor, remove anything valuable from the deck and secure anything else, lock your hatches when off the boat and at night, and keep a bright light burning in the cockpit all night to deter boarders. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Don't let your security lapse because you think everyone is so friendly. Most Papua New Guineans are incredibly friendly and giving and this is an amazing place to cruise. But there are always going to be people struggling and desperate, and they are in those bigger towns, or close by. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another point to note is women should be sensitive with their dress and short or skimpy attire could attract unwanted attention. </span></span></p>
<p>A great many cruisers spend months cruising around PNG with no problems  at all. Always check the current situation before planning an itineray for PNG  (see noonsite <a href="../../General/Piracy"><strong>piracy reports</strong></a> for a  history of security reports from cruisers.)</p>
<p><span>The best way to find out about changing conditions is to listen to the news, both Radio Australia and Radio New Zealand having good Overseas Services for the Pacific area, or by contacting one's high commission or embassy in Port Moresby, who are usually well informed.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cruisers' Advice</strong></span></p>
<p>Useful reports on security by cruisers who have been to PNG:</p>
<p><i><span>Yacht Adina visited PNG in 2015. Their sailing notes have a list of all the anchorages they visited and advice on security. They</span><span> did a lot of research in planning their route and did not encounter any problems. </span><span>Yacht Adina Papua New Guinea Anchorage is available on:<br/></span><span><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.yachtadina.co.uk/sailingnotes">www.yachtadina.co.uk/sailingnotes</a></strong></span></i></p>

<p><strong>Areas where cruisers have experienced crime:</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Main Island</i></strong></p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="PortMoresby"><strong>Port Moresby</strong></a> and<strong> <a class="external-link" href="Lae">Lae</a></strong> have been particularly affected by the surge in criminality; however, the area around the yacht club in Port Moresby is relatively trouble-free.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="Madang"><strong>Madang</strong></a> on the northern coast of New Guinea, a popular stop with cruisers on their way to Indonesia, is now reported to have increasing security problems similar to those afflicting Lae and Port Moresby. A luxury motoryacht was boarded by thieves here in 2014 and a cruising yacht was boarded and attacked in Hansa Bay, October 2015.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="Wewak"><strong>Wewak</strong></a>, also on the north coast of mainland PNG, saw a yacht boarded by armed men with machetes and robbed in the presence of a military patrol in December 2015.</p>
<p>Theft from yachts is increasingly a risk on the islands East of the main island. Local knowledge and basic safety precautions are necessary.</p>
<p><strong><i>New Ireland &amp; New Britain</i></strong></p>
<p>Safe anchorage can be found in a number of locations in New Ireland and New Britain. In Kavieng, New Ireland, anchorage off the Nusa Island Retreat on Nusalik Island provides a secure base. In New Britain, local advice remains that anchorage at Rabaul and Kokopo cannot be recommended, as boardings and thefts continue to occur here. The Duke of York Islands, close to Kokopo, have several good anchorages, with local villagers keen to ensure the safety of their island group for travelling yachts.</p>
<p><strong><i>Outer Islands</i></strong></p>
<p>Lever Harbor, New Georgia: Attempted night time theft from cockpit, 2014.</p>
<p>It is strongly advised that yachts avoid the Manus area (Admiralty Group) as yachts visiting in September 2011 experienced threatening behaviour from local "officials" (see <span>report adjacent).</span></p>
<p id="content"><span>Vessels travelling west or east </span><span>to/from Kavieng in Papua New Guinea and Jayapura in Indonesia, a distance of some 670 nautical </span><span>miles, should note refueling opportunities are limited. Manus is an option if fuel is needed.</span></p>
