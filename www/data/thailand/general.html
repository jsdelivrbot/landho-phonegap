<p>If using your own mobile phone in Thailand, the costs of both making and receiving phone calls when you are in Thailand are so high that it’s probably not a good idea if you are staying longer than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Buying a SIM card once you are in Thailand is probably an easier and cheaper option. A SIM card can be bought on a pay as you go basis for about 1000 Thai Baht of $30. Calls are cheap to make and free to receive. The only thing you have to consider is whether your own mobile phone is locked. Many phone providers deliberately lock their phones to make it impossible to use on rival networks. This can be overcome however for a small price at any phone shop in Thailand.  Mobile phone retailers are very easy to find in Thailand even in smaller towns.</p>

<p class="documentContent mceContentBody"><span>Do your research before hiring a motorbike in Thailand. It is mandatory to have a motorbike license, a </span><span>car license will not do. </span><span>You must carry your license on you at all times when on the motorbike. Hire shops will not check that you have a motorbike license and may not know the rules anyway. A motorbike license from </span><span>another country is fine as long as the correct endorsements are there, if one has an international license permit to ride a motorbike it must have the A (for motorbike) endorsed, stamped or dated.</span></p>
<p class="documentContent mceContentBody"><span>Note: </span><span>If you stay in Thailand longer than 3 months, have a work permit, retirement visa or any long term visa, you MUST have a Thai license. The Police probably won't give you an infringement for not complying , but if one was to be involved in an accident there could be countless problems.</span></p>
