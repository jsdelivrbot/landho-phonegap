<li>Thailand is visited yearly by a large number of yachts and formalities are  getting simpler every year. September 2011 saw the launch of on-line check in  for yachts in Phuket. However, as with Singapore, in 2014 the requirement to have AIS on board in Phuket was introduced. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand?rc=Formalities">Formalities</a></strong> for more information.</li>
<li>The country's cruising attractions are many: its rich culture inland; secluded  anchorages around Phuket Island and its many offshore islets, away from the  crowded resorts; many anchorages to be found on the coast north from Malaysia.</li>
<li>Both repair and docking facilities have greatly improved in Phuket in recent  years. Facilities in the other ports are more limited. More repair facilities  are obviously available in the capital Bangkok, but it is a busy polluted city,  totally unsuitable for yachts.</li>
<li>If carrying out substantial repairs in Thailand, care should be taken to  oversee all works. Whilst prices are very cheap here, often, unskilled labour  are used by yards with little or no knowledge of yacht systems. Failure to  supervise on your part could result in disastrous results.
