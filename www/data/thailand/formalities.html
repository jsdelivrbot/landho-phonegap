<div><p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION FOR ALL PORTS OF ENTRY</strong></p>
<p>Yachts should anchor flying the Q flag. Customs very rarely visit yachts.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours of arrival, except at weekends, the captain must go ashore to complete entry formalities.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>ALL crew must now visit Immigration on arrival and departure to have their photographs taken (same procedure as at the airports).</p>
<p>The paperwork is simplified if any crew who are leaving the yacht, are recorded as passengers. The alternative is to place a substantial cash bond before leaving the country. This is difficult to reclaim. It is advisable for them to be noted as passengers on the zarpe from the previous port.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> From 21st February 2014 the Custom rules have been changed yet again and the length of time a yacht is permitted to stay in the country is no longer tied to the length of the owner's visa. The initial time is now 6 months, with the ability to apply for an extension for another 6 months. See <a href="Countries/Thailand?rc=Formalities#Customs"><strong>Customs below</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Note however that this rule is not necesserily understood and practiced by all clearance ports. Krabi for one is still operating using the old rules. Printing out this <a class="external-link" href="images/pdfs/thailand_new-amendment-to-customs-regulations_2014_eng/"><strong>pdf of the New Amendment to Customs Regulations</strong></a> and presenting it to Customs should you have problems is worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>PHUKET INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>AIS REQUIREMENT<br/></strong>As of 1 October 2014 all foreign vessels visiting Phuket are required to have an AIS Class B (or higher) transponder installed. Effective 1 January 2016 it is now mandatory for all in-coming and out-going yachts to have AIS. <span>See the </span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/Phuket"><strong>Phuket</strong> </a><span>page for more details. Failure to have an AIS transponder will result in a substantial fine.</span></p>
<p><strong>ON-LINE CHECK IN<a href="Countries/Thailand/Phuket"><br/>Phuket</a></strong> now has an on-line check-in for yachts. The web address for this relatively new service is<strong> <a href="http://yacht.phuket.go.th">http://yacht.phuket.go.th</a></strong>. Whilst you can fill in the forms online, you still have to print them out and take them to the Customs, Immigration and Harbourmaster. However, it makes the whole process much quicker and simpler. See report on using the new yacht centre at Chalong Pier in August 2014<strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/comments-from-a-recent-check-in-phuket-by-foreign-flagged-yacht-owner/"> here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>Corruption amongst Thai Marine Officials does exist and can affect visiting cruising yachts. Read this </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/Countries/Thailand/thailand-phuket-phang-nga-bay-thai-officials-try-to-fine-australian-yacht">news article</a></strong><span> for more about what to watch out for.</span></p>

<div><p><strong>Visa on Arrival - 30 days</strong></p>
<p><i>Yacht crew</i> arriving without a visa will be granted a 30 day stay on arrival (a "transit visa"). It is not easy to extend this visa, so if wanting to stay longer you will have to travel out of Thailand by plane or overland and get a new visa on re-entering <i>(see details on bond payment below)</i>.</p>
<p>Visas for longer stays can be issued and are accepted if one has been signed on as a passenger, not crew. Every boat needs at least one crew (normally the skipper), so the remaining crew can be classed as passengers and will then be given a 30 day visa on arrival which can be renewed twice, but only for 15 days at a time, making a total stay of 60 days (as per tourists who arrive by air).</p>
<p>For a list of countries entitled to visa exemption or visa on arrival go to <strong><a href="http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/123/15393-Visa-on-Arrival.html" target="_blank">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/123/15393-Visa-on-Arrival.html</a></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Travelling out of Thailand - placing a bond</strong></span></p>
<p>All yacht <i>crew</i> (not passengers) leaving Thailand for whatever reason without their boat, must declare the dates of departure with Immigration when checking-in and pay a security bond of THB20,000 which is refundable. <span>This bond is in case the person decides to not leave and therefore overstays their visa – the bond is then confiscated by Immigration and could be used to deport the person when found or just held as a fine for breaking the agreement to leave.</span></p>
<p><span><span>As stated above, the bond only applies to whoever Immigration consider as<i> crew</i> and there must be one crew on the boat which is usually the skipper. All the others as passengers get the 30 days and can leave any way they like without the need for a security bond.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you fly back into Thailand, your bond money will be refunded to you by Immigration in your port of entry minus a THB200 fee.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If a captain knows in advance that he will be leaving the country, he should perhaps declare one of the crew members staying on the boat as captain/crew and himself as a passenger. There must always be someone who is designated to be in charge of the boat; and it is not possible for everyone to be declared as passengers.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><b>Note: </b><span>It is possible to pay a one-off, non-recoverable fee of BT2,000 to have your passport re-stamped as a passenger.</span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Some Immigration departments are more strict about this requirement than others.</p>
<p><span><strong><i>If you want to stay in Thailand longer than 30 days, consider getting a visa in advance. If you hold a 60 day advance visa, this also negates the requirement to pay a bond if leaving the country by other means.</i></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><i>See this <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/leaving-your-boat-in-thailand-paying-a-bond-and-visa-extensions/">Useful Report </a>about visas and leaving the country by plane.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Visa in Advance</strong></p>
<p>If you obtain a 60 day visa (which can be extended for another 30 days) before you arrive in Thailand, life is more simple.  Most will obtain this visa in Penang. This visa is a tourist visa and your passport stamp on arrival will have the letters TR in the middle.</p>
<p><span>If you arrive with a visa, then you will be given a "white card" which negates the requirement to pay a bond if leaving the country by plane or overland.</span></p>
<p>If you need to extend this visa for an additional 30 days, go to your local Immigration office with 2 passport photographs, a copy of your passport photograph page, a copy of the page with your entry stamp and a copy of the visa itself.  Prepare to wait for 2 hours and pay THB1,900.</p>
<p>For detailed current regulations see <a href="http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/123"><strong>Visa information for The Kingdom of Thailand</strong></a></p>
<p>For information on a long-stay visa permitting self-funding visitors over the age of 50 to stay for up to a year, see <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/123/15385-Non-Immigrant-Visa-%22O-A%22-(Long-Stay).html">Non-Immigrant Visa Regulations</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Where to get a Visa?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are a number of different visas issued by various Thai embassies or consulates. Yachts are advised to check with their nearest Thai embassy or consulate for details on what visas are on offer.</p>
<p>There is now a Thai consulate in Langkawi, but Penang is still more convenient at the moment for visas.</p>

<div><p><strong>Length of Stay Permitted</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: From 21st February 2014 the rules regarding length of stay for visiting yachts were amended. </strong></p>
<p>Thai legislation now states that a vessel entering Thailand may stay for <b>up to 6 months</b> initially. <span>Customs may then extend the time-limit, on application, to allow the yacht to remain in Thailand for up to another six months.</span></p>
<p><span>First application can be for a 4 month extension and then a final 2 month one. Both applications should be made 4 weeks before your existing permit expires as the paperwork has to go to Bankok for approval. A photo of the boat showing its name clearly displayed is required, along with a letter from the marina and photo copies of your visa and passport.</span></p>
<p><span>Be aware that at some Ports of Entry Customs interpret these rules in their own way (for example in Krabi, where cruisers report in 2016 that <span>they are only giving 2 month extensions, 3 if you push).</span></span></p>

<p><span>The fine for overstaying is <span>1,000 baht per day of overstay with a maximum of <span>10,000 baht.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Customs Rules</strong></span></p>
<p>Firearms should be declared. They will be removed and held until departure, unless there is a secure locker on board, where they can be sealed under the supervision of Customs officials.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to declare any medication which may contain a narcotic, even if it is a prescription drug.</p>

<div><p>Immigration charge between 200 and 300 Baht for clearing in, and for clearing out. On Saturdays/Sundays and Holidays this goes up to 500 Baht.</p>
<p>The bond for someone arriving by yacht and listed as crew but who plans to leave the country by other means is 20,000 Baht (cash).</p>

<div><p><strong>National Parks</strong></p>
<p><span>Nearly all of the waters of Thailand are covered by one national park or another. </span><span>The Chief Park Ranger can:-</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Charge the schedule anchoring fees as set out by the Forestry Department. This is up to 200 baht per night for the yacht depending on its size (and also the number of persons it takes e.g. he may charge more for a 30ft yacht with 5 people than a 40ft boat with 2 people).</li>
<li> Charge the park visiting fee - this is per person and per visit, be it one day or a week - but again it depends on the ranger. Fees are between 200 and 500 Baht per person per day, and are due to increase 1 February 2015.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The current charges (October 2014) for Koh Rok Nok, Koh Lanta, Surin &amp; Similan islands National Parks are 400 baht ($13) per person and 200 baht for the boat for 3 days. The charges are due to increase from 1 February 2015 to 500 baht per person.</span></p>

<p>For the other islands, you may be allowed to fish but you must ask the ranger first, again it is up to the individual ranger.</p>
