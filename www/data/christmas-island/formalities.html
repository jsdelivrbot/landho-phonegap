<p>All yachts arriving on Christmas Island are required to clear  Q<span>uarantine, Customs and Immigration </span>formalities before disembarking. Departure formalities are also required.</p>
<p>The police keep watch on channel 16 on a 24 hr basis, the Port Captain can be reached on Ch 16 during office hours. All persons must remain on board until the yacht has been inspected and cleared.</p>
<p>Formalities are preferably conducted on shore by Customs and Quarantine officers. Customs will instruct where and when to land. If necessary, Customs will launch a boat and perform the necessary paperwork onboard.</p>
<p>Quarantine is strict, and eggs and some meat products may be confiscated, or sealed on board. Depending on the officer in charge, some fresh fruit and vegetables may be kept.</p>
<p>No quarantine charges will be levied if one arrives from the Australia mainland. Also there is no charge if your yacht has spent five months in the past six in Australia.</p>
<p>Mooring is mandatory to prevent damage to the coral reef, and a mooring fee is charged of $10AS per day which must be paid to the harbour master prior to clearance being issued. It has been reported that yachts will be allowed to anchor if numbers are too many for the moorings.</p>
<p>On departure yachts are to notify Customs and Immigration, located at the police station. A Customs clearance form will be issued, which must be handed to Customs before departure.</p>
<p>Outward clearance is also required by the Harbour Master on leaving, when all bills must be settled. The Customs office is open 0800-1600 Monday to Friday.</p>
