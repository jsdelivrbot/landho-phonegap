<div class="hello"><div><p>Normally anchoring is not permitted in order to protect the coral , but if it is necessary, then yachts should beware of the chains between the shore and the large mooring buoys. There is a 5kn speed limit in the bay.</p>
<p><strong>Moorings</strong> There are only five moorings available for yachts and rafting up is almost impossible due to the swell that often enters the bay. However, in the tradewind season when the winds stay in the SE, the anchorage is very acceptable.</p>
<p>A visit should be avoided during what the locals call swell season between December and April. There are talks about installing alternative moorings, but nothing is there as yet.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong> Anchoring is normally prohibited and the use of  mooring buoys is mandatory. A mooring fee is charged of $10AS per day which must be paid to the Harbour Master prior to clearance being issued.</p>
<p><strong>Dinghies</strong> Rubber yacht dinghies may tie up to the Jetty steps area, but aluminum craft are discouraged from doing so as they may suffer damage, or cause dammage to the structure of the steps and rails.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities</strong> Located at the western end of the Marine building are the public showers and toilets, open 24 hours each day, and provided for the convenience of visiting yachts.</p>
