<div><p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Every yacht arriving from overseas must inform Customs and agricultural quarantine officers by VHF radio (Ch. 16), telephone or e-mail (<a href="Yachts@customs.govt.nz">Yachts@customs.govt.nz</a>) of one's intended ETA. This must be done at <strong>least 48 hours</strong> before arrival.</p>
<p>Russell Radio <a href="Countries/NewZealand/Opua%28BayofIslands%29/?rc=ShoreServices#Communications">(<strong>see communications, Opua</strong>)</a> will inform Customs and Immigration of a boat's arrival if this is requested by radio.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Border Agencies Information Pack for Yachts and Small Craft is available online at <a href="http://www.customs.govt.nz/inprivate/arrivalbyprivatecraft/yachtsandsmallcraft/Pages/default.aspx"><strong>http://www.customs.govt.nz/inprivate/arrivalbyprivatecraft/yachtsandsmallcraft/Pages/default.aspx</strong></a> and from yacht clubs around the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Text versions of the arrival notification form, and also the departure forms, can be accessed through the <strong><a href="http://www.customs.govt.nz">New Zealand Customs website</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have entered New Zealand territorial waters (12 nautical miles), the International Q-flag must be clearly displayed. All craft arriving in New Zealand from overseas must first report at a Customs port of entry.</p>
<p>On approaching the port of entry one should endeavour to confirm one's arrival. This can be done by VHF via Taupo Maritime Radio, which maintains repeaters along the coast. Alternatively, local port authority radio stations can forward an arrival confirmation. The arrival itself must be confirmed to the port on VHF channel 16.</p>
<p>If a yacht is not able to contact the authorities by radio and arrives unannounced, the captain must immediately contact Customs or police by telephone (toll free numbers are available: Whangarei customs 0800 428 786). No one else must go ashore until clearance is complete.</p>
<p>Taupo Maritime Radio keeps continuous radio watch on 2182 kHz, 8291 kHz, 4125 kHz, 6215 kHz and 16420 kHz as well as VHF channel 16. They can also be contacted on Tel. +64 9 359 6655 or +64 25 961 375 (after hours). A telephone report may also be made to MAF in Auckland, Tel. +64 9 366 0345, +64 9 309 9093 or +64 274 975 171 (after hours).</p>
<p>Once your craft has arrived, Customs and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) quarantine officers will meet you. On arrival, every yacht must clear customs, immigration (via Customs) and undergo an inspection by a quarantine officer before clearance is complete.</p>
<p>The same entry and departure formalities apply to New Zealand yachts as to foreign vessels.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/B9DA437F-1AE8-4F44-8F2C-9BA4BC2E7BEA/0/1083.pdf"><strong>Immigration Guide for yachts arriving from offshore</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Mediterranean Fanworm Controls in Northland</strong><br/>If anyone is cruising in the Pacific and planning to spend the cyclone season in NZ, be aware that authorities are trying to control Mediterranean Fanworm in Northland. All marinas from Marsden Cove to Whangaroa are now insisting that arriving boats either prove they had had their hulls inspected in the previous month or had anti-foul applied within six months. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/NewZealand?rc=Formalities#Restrictions">Restrictions</a></strong> for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong></p>
<p>All craft departing overseas from New Zealand must depart from a Customs port of entry. A Customs officer will attend at the agreed time and place of departure.</p>
<p>You must advise the New Zealand Customs Service at least 72 hours before your intended departure to ensure that there is no delay. Once issued with a clearance certificate, yachts are required to go to sea within a reasonable time. Any delay should be reported to Customs.</p>
<p>The controversial Clause 21 of the Maritime Safety Act, requiring each pleasure craft departing New Zealand to obtain a Safety Certificate, has been repealed.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p><strong>Yachts<br/></strong>Yachts and small craft entering New Zealand are technically subject to import clearance charges, Customs duty and goods and services tax (GST). If the craft is owned and operated by a bona fide visitor, however, and is in New Zealand only temporarily, it may be granted a Temporary Import Entry (TIE) – meaning Customs duty and GST charges are deferred. The new maximum duration is now 24 months. The new regulations also permit super-yachts to charter as long as it does not take up more than 65% of its time in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="custom-styleElement-P">An extension beyond 24 months <strong>may </strong>be granted for emergencies, and such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Should permission be given, Customs <strong>may </strong>require <span>a cash deposit or security to cover Customs charges. This will be returned or released, together with interest, provided the vessel leaves within the agreed date.</span></p>
<p class="custom-styleElement-P"><strong><i>Note:</i></strong> Be sure to take your TIE with you if flying out of NZ so you can prove you have onward travel out of the country when flying back. You will also need to show your TIE if visiting your local Customs office to clear-in spares and parts from abroad.</p>
<p><span>If planning to live and work in New Zealand, then the necessary visa must be obtained<strong> before</strong> arrival, otherwise the concession on the payment of duty will not apply. See the NZ Customs website (link below) for more details on this concession.</span></p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.customs.govt.nz/inprivate/arrivalbyprivatecraft/yachtsandsmallcraft/Pages/default.aspx"><strong>www.customs.govt.nz</strong></a> for the rules covering ship's stores regarding alcohol and tobacco.</p>
<p>All equipment other than fixtures must be declared, although these will not be subject to duty if remaining on board and re-exported on departure. Some may have to be sealed by customs. Items to be landed must be declared to customs on arrival. Goods imported into New Zealand such as radios and navigation equipment require a Temporary Import form and a deposit to cover duty and sales tax, which will be refunded on re-export. If imported permanently, they will be subject to duty.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons</strong><br/> Firearms must be declared to customs, and are normally kept in police custody until departure. If there is an onboard safe for firearms, this may be approved by the police.</p>
<p>The importation of weapons such as flick knives, swordsticks, knuckle-dusters, and any weapon designed to give the appearance of another article, is prohibited.</p>
<p>If any firearms were detained on your arrival, contact the New Zealand Police to arrange for them to be delivered to your vessel prior to your departure. Make sure you allow sufficient time for the firearm(s) to be transported to your port of departure, particularly if this is different from your port of arrival.</p>
<p>To contact the New Zealand Police, phone 09 302 6400 between 07:00 and 16:30 Monday to Friday, and ask for the Arms officer.</p>
<p><strong>Medicines</strong><br/> Medicines should be accompanied by a prescription and be kept in their original packing.</p>
<p><strong>Duty-Free Supplies</strong><br/> Purchases made in New Zealand have duty paid on them, but if they are exported a refund of duty can be obtained from customs on proof of purchase and export. Cruisers report that exactly how to carry out this procedure is extremely difficult to find out and many prefer to source parts outside NZ, have a friend group them all together and mail them to NZ as "yacht in transit".</p>
<p>Duty-free supplies vary from port to port. Purchases may be made from a Licensed Export Warehouse before departure, to be delivered just before departure and checked by customs.</p>
<p>A government sales tax of 15% is charged on all goods and services. It can be avoided by yachts in possession of the TIE document, provided the taxable product is affixed permanently to the yacht by the vendor. Especially those having major work done on their boats should make sure that they are not charged this tax. As many non-food items are subject to tax, temporary visitors to New Zealand can claim a refund on all the tax and duty paid on such items which are going to be taken out of the country.</p>
<p><span>Whilst duty free fuel is heavily promoted for international cruisers in NZ, cruisers report that in fact only one location could provide it - Opua. </span></p>
<p>The downloadable <a href="http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/listsandguides/Documents/Yacht%20pack.pdf"><strong>Yacht Pack</strong></a> contains all the required Customs information and forms.</p>
<p><strong>Biosecurity</strong></p>
<p>Biosecurity is taken very seriously in order to protect New Zealand against imported infections and diseases and there are strict controls in place.</p>
<p>On arrival, a quarantine officer from the MAF, who should be contacted before arrival, carries out an inspection. If that cannot be done, one should telephone MAF on arrival - they accept collect calls - or contact them through the local police. Until clearance is completed, nothing must be landed and the crew must remain on board. After clearance is completed, if it has been necessary to place any provisions under seal or if there are animals on board, regular inspections by an agriculture officer may be carried out.</p>
<p>It may be more convenient to destroy on arrival any provisions that have to be sealed or stores that cannot be landed. Obviously it is advisable to arrive with a minimum of fresh stores.</p>
<p>Items that must not be landed are fruit, vegetables, plant products, foodstuffs, eggs and waste from these items, pot plants, meat and animal products. All waste must be disposed of through the proper garbage disposal system including egg containers. The quarantine officer will explain this on arrival. Until such stores are consumed or destroyed the yacht will be under surveillance and restricted to berthing at a wharf where these garbage facilities are available. Organic garbage should be disposed of before entering New Zealand territorial waters (12 mile limit). The quarantine officer may also inspect for pesticides, which must be of a formula registered in New Zealand. This can include insecticide sprays, cockroach traps and antifouling.</p>
<p>Bicycles, motorcycles and sporting equipment must be washed or cleaned before landing, for which a written authority is required.</p>
<p>The yacht's hull must be clean and well antifouled.</p>

<div><p><span>Any visitors to New Zealand who have symptoms such as a temperature, rash, glandular swelling or jaundice, or who have severe diarrhoea or know of the presence of an infectious disease or symptoms should visit a general practitioner on arrival or if such symptoms arise during their visit.</span></p>
<p>As exotic mosquitoes are capable of carrying diseases of human health significance MAF inspects all yachts arriving in New Zealand to identify the presence of all life stages of mosquitoes or of potential breeding sites (such as pooled water). Persons on board yachts should be aware of the risk of carrying such insects to New Zealand and keep yachts free of potential mosquito breeding habitat.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Care</strong></p>
<p>Care for international visitors is expensive and difficult to find. Cruisers report that many doctors refuse to see tourists. Prescription drugs are very expensive. Government facilities cost approx. $500 NZD a visit. Private clinics most likely less.</p>
<p>Dental care however is easier to find and much cheaper.</p></div>

<div><p><strong>TIE (see Customs above)</strong><br/><span>You will receive this from Customs on entry into NZ. It documents your tax free status. Carry a copy of the form in your wallet/purse and provide it to merchants upon request as proof of your tax free status.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marinas - Electrical Inspection</strong><br/><span>If you plan to use a marina in NZ you will have to pay to have a yacht electrical inspection. The marina will typically assist you in getting a NZ certified electrician to inspect your shore power outlet and cord. After paying him/her $50-$100 NZD you will get a certificate which can be shown at each marina you visit. Whilst some cruisers report that a few marinas "looked the other way" for international visitors, most do not.</span></p>
<p><strong>Propane/Butane - Tank Inspections<br/></strong>Before any gas or dive tank bottle will be filled by a service provider, it must be inspected and approved by a New Zealand tank inspector. In a few rare cases in the Auckland area a government permit to have the tank inspected must be secured before you can get your tank inspected. This governmental permit costs around $75 NZD per bottle. Then you take your cylinder to the tank inspector, wait a few days, and pay him about $50 NZD per tank. He/she will stamp a "New Zealand LAB number" on your tank if the bottle is good. You can then take your tank to a gas fill station or dive shop. This applies to every non-New Zealand tank, regardless of condition, age, or origin. Government regulations state that fibreglass tanks cannot be inspected or filled.</p>

<p><strong>Marine Environment<br/></strong>Authorities urge all visiting skippers before leaving for NZ to clean their hull of fouling and slime growth, wash down any tenders, fishing gear or diving gear and flush out with fresh water any areas on the yacht that retain seawater.</p>
<p>While in New Zealand don't throw any marine organisms or material overboard that may contain live creatures, weed or even plankton. If you need to clean your hull you are urged to go to a facility that has some means of capturing the fouling material so that exotic organisms are not deposited on the beach or in the sea. It is illegal to clean your hull in the Bay of Islands.</p>
<p>No untreated sewage may be discharged from your boat within 500 metres of the shore, a marine farm or a marine reserve, or in water less than 5 metres in depth.</p>
<p><span><strong>Chartering</strong><br/></span>Both the yacht and the crew become liable for New Zealand tax if engaged in chartering. Normally one would have to set up a New Zealand based company through which to charter the yacht or to us a New Zealand based agent. These rules are under review.</p>
<p><strong>Other Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>It is illegal to use marine VHF handheld radios ashore.</p>
<p>The importation of products made from endangered species is prohibited, such as: ivory, tortoise shell, whalebone, coral, crocodile, lizard or snake skins.</p>

<div><p>New Zealand is a rabies-free country. The New Zealand authorities actively discourage animals arriving on yachts and the restrictions placed on those with animals on board are considerable.</p>
<p>The Master must place a bond of NZ$1000 for the secure custody of any pets aboard, and this will be forfeited if conditions are not met. Animals must be either placed in quarantine or securely confined and not landed. The Master is required by the bond to notify the MAF 48 hours before departure from a port, indicating the next port of call in New Zealand, and notification must be given even if only moving moorings.</p>
<p>After six months the animal/s must be reshipped from New Zealand or destroyed; if not the yacht must leave the country. In the event of an animal becoming ill, the MAF must be contacted immediately and private vets cannot be consulted without MAF approval. If a pet dies, its body must be given to the agriculture quarantine officer for disposal</p>
<p>Boats with animals on board will be inspected every 48 hours and the inspector's time is charged to the boat owner at an hourly rate of $72.30. Boats may group together and the charges are then shared out. Charges are more expensive at outlying ports such as Opua. Any pets obtained in New Zealand must be added to the bond.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs coming from Australia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii,Singapore and the Republic of Ireland do not require quantantine but require a Health Certificate and a Rabies Vaccination Certificate and will be inspected for ticks on arrival. There is a specific "Dogs and Cats on Yachts Import Health Standard" for cats and dogs being brought into New Zealand, and any equipment associated with the animals must also comply with the relevant "Import Health Standard for Equipment Associated with Animals".</p>
<p>Pet Medication - a separate declaration is needed to import veterinary medicines for use on accompanied animals. A copy of the veterinarian's prescription label must be provided with the declaration.  However, excessive amounts of veterinary medicines (generally more than 3 months supply) might not be given clearance. Consult the Agriculture and Veterinary Medicines Group if in doubt (Tel: +64 4 463 2500).</p>
