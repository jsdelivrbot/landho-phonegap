<p><strong>Internet</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous Internet service providers in NZ, however cruisers report that it is expensive when you can expect narrow band width, frequent drops, and no service found in many parts of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Free Internet access for one hour can be found in some coffee shops, some Mc'Donalds, a few libraries, and in some community business districts.</p>
<p><strong>Post Office</strong></p>
<p><span>There are post offices everywhere in NZ providing a wide range of banking, postal, and communication services. They deliver just about everything throughout New Zealand in one day or less. </span><span>Their foreign exchange rates are very good and the related fee is low. </span></p></div>

<div><p>Almost all forms of transportation (planes, buses, taxis, car rentals) are expensive in NZ. The one exception appears to be the purchase of older second-hand cars.</p>
<p>Many cruisers buy a cheap car, drive it around for six months and then try to sell it for a few dollars before sailing away.</p>
<p>Car rental per day is approx. $30.</p>
<p>Parking charges in Auckland are very high.</p>
<p>The ferry between the North and South islands costs approx. <span>$230 each way.</span></p>
<p>If planning on leaving your boat in NZ while flying abroad, be sure to take your <span>Temporary Importation Exemption certificate with you, so you can prove that you sailed into NZ. Many airlines require that you have an onward travel ticket if flying into NZ.</span></p></div>

<p><strong>New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf including the Mercury Islands, Mercury Bay and Great Barrier Island</strong><br/> By David Thatcher<br/> Publisher - Captain Teach Press - 4th Edition 2011<br/> ISBN 9781877197420 <br/> This very comprehensive chart-book and guide is now in its fourth edition and differs from all earlier editions in scope, content and presentation. The book is the new, re-titled edition of the Hauraki Gulf Boating Atlas by the same author. With overseas cruising visitors in mind, this edition begins with an introduction to New Zealand and the Gulf area in particular, including a brief description of port entry from overseas. The guide divides the Hauraki Gulf and extensions east of the Coromandel Peninsula to Mercury Bay and Whitianga into 5 regions, with each having an introduction for visiting lovers-of-the-sea, be they locals, or cruisers here for the first time. Each region contains full-colour reproductions of sections of the official, large scale LINZ charts, showing the bays and coasts. In this edition all the available charts for the Waitemata Harbour and Tamaki River are included and double-page layouts for areas such as the Broken Islands Passage at Great Barrier, the Rangitoto Channel, Kawau Bay, and other areas which benefit from a larger scale presentation. The author provides an excellent and informative narrative from his experiences within each region. Many full colour photographs are provided to assist navigation and the selection of places to cruise, and also to describe some of the history and general interest. GPS reference points are tabulated with matching chart icons. An introductory section gives the radio VHF channels for stations in the Gulf area and details for obtaining weather information, for which the Gulf is particularly well served in New Zealand. The book is well indexed both by subject and also by GPS references. In the Gulf area, 'New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf' is unmatched as a functional cruising guide and as a very attractive addition to the personal library.</p></div>
