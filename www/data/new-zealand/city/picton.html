<div class="hello"><div><p>There are numerous marina berths in Picton harbour.</p>
<p>Just a mile north east of Picton, lies the large modern marina of Waikawa. The bay here also provides plenty of sheltered anchorages.</p>
<p>Although only about 15km directly west of Picton, Havlock is very many miles by sea, but it also provides excellent shelter in the marina there.</p>
<p>The Marlborough Sounds is a large area and has many splendid anchorages.</p>
<p>Marlborough Marine Industries Association was established late 2013 and comprises a group of marine related businesses keen to offer their services to the world cruising community as well as local sailors. <span>The local port authority is involved and will arrange marina berths and customs too.</span></p>
