<div class="hello"><div><p>The Magazine Bay area has been left in decline for over a decade since its breakwater was removed. Following serious storm damage at the start of 2002, and subsequent earthquake damage in 2010 and 2011, Lytletton Marina should be used with caution.</p>
<p>The Marina offers no protection from the fierce southerly winds that blow across the harbour from Gebbies Pass and several boats have sunk during storms in recent years here.</p>
<p>The local Council now have responsibility for the area of land known as Naval Point and Magazine Bay. This includes the marina facilities, jetties extending to magazine Bay and the public slipway. Day-to-day maintenance of the 46 Marina berths is by the Naval Point Yacht Club.</p>
<p>Redevelopment plans have been proposed, to develop the marina area and build a new breakwater, however to date, nothing has been confirmed or started and the marina is in a state of disrepair. Yachts report however that it is possible to berth here if necessary (see comment at bottom of page).</p>
<p><span>Lyttleton inner harbour is small and very busy with commercial traffic. There is no room for visiting yachts</span></p>
<p><span><span>While there are some very good anchorages locally, they are in the main in bays opposite to the port of Lyttelton or just outside the main harbour. Effectively between a half and one hours motoring (5 knts) from the port or inner harbour.</span></span></p>
