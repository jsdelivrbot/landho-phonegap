<div class="hello"><div><p>Located south east of Auckland, Tauranga is a large sheltered harbour in the Bay of Plenty.</p>
<p><span>It has become popular as a Port of Entry with yachts arriving from Tonga, as well as a place to be based during the hurricane season. Weather is better here (less rain than Northland),</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>As you come within range of Tauranga contact should be made through one of the following:-</span></p>
<p><span></span>Plenty Maritime Radio  VHF channel 68<br/> Tauranga Volunteer Coastguard VHF channel 83<br/> Tauranga Bridge Marina VHF channel 73</p>
<p><span>You should provide them with your arrival time. Any of these organizations will contact Customs and let them know of your arrival so they can meet you.</span></p>
<p><span>Tauranga has its own Customs office as it is a major New Zealand shipping port. The advantage of this is that you do not have to deal with Auckland. Since fewer clear in here from the islands a year, the officials are not overwhelmed by yachts and are extremely cooperative. Extensions are handled here directly and are straight forwarded and simple. Immigration is handled through Hamilton rather than Auckland, again away from the major paperwork congestion that the seems to surround transactions with the big city.</span></p>
<p>Upon arrival at your slip in a marina, you will be immediately met by Customs (who also takes care of the Immigration formalities) and MAF.  They do this on a 24 hour/7 day a week basis.</p>
