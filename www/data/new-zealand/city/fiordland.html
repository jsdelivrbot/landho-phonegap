<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an area on the south west coast of South Island comprising of magnificient fiords. The most notable being Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound. Most of the area is a National Park and there are several off shore Marine Reserves where fishing is restricted. The area is practically uninhabited, so it is important to be very self-sufficient when cruising here.</p>
