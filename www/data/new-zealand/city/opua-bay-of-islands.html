<div class="hello"><div><p>Opua is known as the “Gateway to New Zealand” and is located 17 miles from Cape Brett light. This beautiful area is very popular with cruising boats and is the primary arrival port for boats that have crossed the Pacific. </p>
<p>Officials are reported to be efficient, polite and helpful and there is a designated floating Quarantine wharf which makes clearance here very straightforward.</p>
<p>Port Opua is well marked and an easy approach any time of day or night. In addition to Opua, there are three other main townships in the Bay; Paihia 10 min, Russell 15 min and Kerikeri 25 min.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details on clearing into and out of New Zealand see <a href="Countries/NewZealand?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><b>Noonsite/New Zealand/Formalities</b></a>. In particular, pay attention to the new strict controls in place to prevent the entry of Mediterranean fanworm into NZ.</p>
<p>In Opua, the Custom's dock is located at the northern end of the Opua Marina outer breakwater and is clearly marked as a quarantine area - with no access to shore. It is possible to tie to either side so it can handle a large number of yachts. Customs and MAF travel to and from the dock in their work boats.</p>
<p>Opua Marina berths can be arranged from here via VHF 12. Customs will give you a map of the marina upon asking. Be careful shifting your boat within the marina as the tide runs strongly through here. If possible shift at slack water.</p>
<p>At times it may be necessary to contact customs on 0800 428 786. A MAF inspection must be completed immediately on arrival and if additional travel expenses are incurred or this has to be done outside of normal working hours, any costs may be charged to the yacht.</p>
<p>Once entry formalities are completed the crew and vessel are free to travel throughout the country and are not required to report their movements until departure.</p>
