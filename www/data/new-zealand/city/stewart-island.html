<div class="hello"><div><p>This 50 by 30 mile island lies 30km off the southern end of South Island, and is home to a small permanent population. It is almost bisected by a large area of sheltered water known as Paterson Inlet. On the northern shore is the only settlement on the Island, Oban, sitting at the head of Halfmoon Bay.</p>
<p><span>Much of the island is a National Park and is visited for its wildlife and hiking trails.</span></p>
<p>Position 46° 53'53"S, 168° 08'E (Halfmoon Bay)</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Oban is the port for the ferries plying the route across the Foveaux Strait to Bluff.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor in the bay.</p>
<p><span>On the south west coast of the island, protected anchorages can be found at Port Pegasus. However, the weather is always a major concern this far south in the 'Roaring Forties'. There is no settlement here.</span></p>
