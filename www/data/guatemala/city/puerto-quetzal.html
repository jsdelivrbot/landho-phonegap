<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a modern commercial port with little attraction as a cruising destination. Few cruisers visit, except to visit the beautiful city of Antigua which is 1.5 hours away.</p>
<p>Carbon soot discharge from ships just west of the marina can be a problem here if a westerly breeze moves in. This gritty, sharp, grey sand will cover your boat. The ENRON bunker diesel power plant operates just inside the Puerto Quetzal entry channel, to the east, which adds to the commercial port environment.</p>
<p><span>This new port was built on the Pacific side to replace the old port of San José.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Port Control should be contacted on VHF Channel 16 for instruction on where to berth for clearance. You need to contact Port Control at the sea buoy to get permission to enter. They will assign an agent to handle all the paperwork. It is very expensive with the cost of an agent at around $300 as well as the $2/ft/night charge for berthing.</span></p>
<p>To ensure the safety of visiting yachts, the Navy requires that yachts come directly to the naval basin, where security is excellent. All formalities are completed from there.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Once into the harbour, enter the western basin and there is docking for yachts in a small basin on the northern side.</p>
<p>The marina, whilst secure, is open to swells from the SW and the surge here is reported to be very bad, with reports of burst fenders and broken dock lines.</p>
