<div class="hello"><div><p><span><span><img class="image-left" src="Countries/guatamala-pics/guatamala_rio-dulce_entering-the-rio/@@images/image/preview"/>The Guatemalan Navy have now replaced the </span></span><span>Livingston sea buoy which marks the channel entrance to the Rio Dulce. </span><span>The new co-ordinates are: </span><span>15-50.29'N x 088-43.71'W (0.46 nm on a bearing of 041 T from the old location).</span></p>
<p>The area known as the Rio Dulce, starts at the mouth of the river on the Bahia de Amatique <i>(Photo "entering the Rio" courtesy of Calypso Marina)</i>.</p>
<p>The small village of Rio Dulce (Fronteras) is 18 miles further up the river, past a spectacular steep walled canyon and a small lake, El Golfete. At this point there are plenty of marine services, provisions, hotels, restaurants and medical services, as well as communications and transport. It is a safe spot in the hurricane season. Beyond this settlement, the river widens to form Lake Izabal, the largest lake in Guatemala.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Be aware that Fronteras is very much a frontier town, with armed guards not only at the banks but at the supermarkets and on the delivery trucks.</p>
<p>A number of visiting yachts have been boarded and some robbed, when anchored at the mouth of the Rio Tatin and, also, there have been a number of incidents in the Rio Dulce itself. <span>October, November and December are typically high theft times. The <span>Guatemalan Navy don't always patrol the river.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Whilst staying in a marina would appear to be a more secure option, boats have been </span></span><span>burgled anchored in front of marinas. </span><span>Dinghy and outboard thefts continue to happen here as well (including from boats berthed in marinas).</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruisers report that marina prices are very low here, your boat is in fresh water and the prices and quality of repair work is very good. Choosing to moor in a marina is obviously the more secure option.</p>
<p><span>If however you choose to anchor, locals advise you do so in front of the village of Fronteras or in front of Ram Marina - Nana Juana. If you want to anchor down the river then choose Texan Bay.</span></p></div></div>
