<div class="hello"><div><p>The small town of Livingston sits at the mouth of the Rio Dulce in Honduras Bay. It has no road or rail connections to the hinterland, just boats and planes. The centre of the town is at the top of a steep hill.</p>
<p>It is not a port to be entered at night, as the lights are unreliable and fishermen often set their nets then, too.</p>
<p><span>There is a wide sand bar at the entrance to Rio Dulce; boats with a draft of over 5 ft (1.50 m) must enter at high tide and the maximum draft that can be carried through at high tide is 7.5 ft (2.20 m). Advice on the state of the tide may be obtained on Channel 68.</span></p>
<p>Cruisers also warn that the location of the outer marker buoy can not be trusted and it is recommended to request a local guide on first-time entering (contact Raul, approximate price $25). It is well worth the small fee as the cost for a tow if you get stuck is $250.</p>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Clearance is straightforward here as officials are used to dealing with yachts.</p>
<p>Fly the Q flag and the officials will come out to the yacht in office hours (closed 1300-1500), for initial clearance and inspection. Customs will take the zarpe from the last port and ship's papers, Immigration take the passports. The captain must collect these later from the shore offices, with the necessary entry stamps as well as a new zarpe and cruising permit.</p>
<p>This can all be done in one day if arriving early enough, and some cruisers have reported it only taking 2 hours. Quetzales will be needed to pay various fees.</p>
<p>If you choose, there is a cruisers customs agent, "Raoul", half a block from the Municipal Dock. He has been recommended by many. His fee is approx. US$12 on top of what the authorities charge. It is quite possible that he will come out to the boat with the officials to offer his services.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The holding in the river is not good and, in addition, be aware of the  significant amount of traffic on the water at night.</p>
<p>La Marina went out of business in 2008, however yachts can berth on the Municipal Dock at Livingston. The fee is 20 Q./day, or US$2.50.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be moored at the dock in front of the hotel "Big Mama" from which it is possible to walk into the town.</p>
