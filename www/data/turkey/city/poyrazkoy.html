<div class="hello"><div><p>Poyrazkoy harbour is on the eastern shore of the Bosphorus at its northern entrance. It may be possible to find a berth on the quay. Weekends are particularly busy.</p>
<p>If necessary, anchor off. It provides an attractive stop out of the swell in the Black Sea. </p>
<p>There is good fresh fish available, as well as restaurants and cafes here.</p>
