<div class="hello"><div><p>Situated at the head of the 30 mile gulf of Izmir Korfezi. Take particular note of the prohibited areas as these are NATO bases and the rules are strictly enforced.</p>
<p>The water here is generally polluted and swimming is not recomended. Not a particularly attractive city to visit and the chop in the harbour can be uncomfortable. There are however alternative, more pleasant mooring options nearby.</p>
<p>Position 38° 24.2'N, 27° 04.1'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a choice of several anchorages in Izmir Bay as well as <span>two nice spots further west: Urla and Çesmealti. Both also have city walls where yachts could in theory tie up, but there is never any room. </span></p>
<p>Yachts can dock in the old harbour in Izmir town as well as at the marina Levant to the SW of the city and at the new marina at <span>Güzelbaçhe</span>, on the southern shore on the approaches to Izmir. Recently the bay has been cleaned of some of the pollution.</p>
<p>The commercial harbour is out of bounds to yachts. In the old harbour, berth stern-to in the NE corner. The holding is good in thick, black mud, but there is often an uncomfortable chop.</p>
<p>Levant Marina is a small independent concern to the SW of the city (<span>38°</span> 24'23.49N, <span>27°</span> 04'07.66E) located next to the auto ferry stop on the South side of Izmir Bay in Uçkuyular. Staff are reported to be very <span>friendly to visiting yachts. The ferry to Izmir is just outside the gate and there is a small town 2 kms away. Advance booking is worthwhile as space is very limited here.</span></p>
<p><span>Güzelbaçhe</span> Marina is a municipal marina currently under construction some distance from Izmir city, but with good transport links (<span>38°</span> 22'40.15N, <span>26°</span> 53'06.83E). The marina is - at the time of writing - still unfinished and there continues to be no charge for berthing here.</p>

      This is still a work in progress with neither  electricity nor water on the piers. Contact the water truck (+90 532 654 9130) and he can deliver up to 10 tons of water. Whilst not officially open yet, yachts can moor here currently for free (Oct.15). Side mooring only. Bottom fouled. Good protection with high sea wall and plenty of depth. Shops close by and farmers market twice a week. Easy public transport into Izmir and metro to airport.
