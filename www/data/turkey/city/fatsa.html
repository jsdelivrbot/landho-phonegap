<div class="hello"><div><p>A useful, sheltered fishing harbour tucked into the SW corner of Fatsa Korfezi. Whilst there are limited facilities for yachts in the harbour, the town is popular with local tourists and has good shopping and services.</p>
<p>The countryside around Fatsa is very pretty and worth exploring with a visit to the mineral water springs of Ilıca. Other attractions include the Pontus era monastery of Göreği, 5 km west of Fatsa, and the ruins of the Bolaman Castle in town.</p>
<p>Position 41° 02.8’N, 37° 29.5’E.</p>
