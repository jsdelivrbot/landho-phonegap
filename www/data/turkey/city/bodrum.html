<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying on the northern shore of the large gulf of Gokova Korfezi, Bodrum is a popular port for visiting yachtsmen. It is an attractive town, although it can be rather hot and dusty in the height of the summer and, in the harbour, noisy.</p>
<p><span>The Castle of St Peter, built in the 15th century by the Knights of St John, looks over the harbour and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of only two remaining Wonders of the Ancient World, built in the fourth century B.C. is well worth a visit.</span></p>

<p>All foreign-flagged yachts must clear in at a marina.</p>
<p>At Bodrum Karada Marina, the Customs and Immigration Authorities are situated near the eastern breakwater. The Health Authority is in the town. The marina can usually arrange the necessary formalities, including the issue of the necessary Transit Log.</p>
<p>D-Marin and Port Bodrum are also now regular Ports of Entry, and formalities are easily completed with all the authorities housed in the same building at the marina.</p>
<p>At Milta Marina, moor at the Customs dock. The travel agency on the site charges a fee for completing clearance and providing the necessary documents.</p>
<p>For clearing out it is recommended cruisers speak to the Harbour Master first. Double handed yachts have reported that they were not required to use an agent for clearing out (just 2 crew). Agents charge approx. 85 Euros for this service. All the offices, <span> Harbor Master, Port Police (passport Control), and finally Customs are located close to the castle and are within walking distance. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a marina at Bodrum itself and a new one to the west, at Turgutreis. Ten miles NW of the town at Yalikavak, across the Bodrum Peninsula, is the new Palmarina Bodrum, run by Camper &amp; Nicholsons.</p>
<p>The "Blue Card" waste disposal monitoring scheme started to be enforced at the beginning of 2012. The Blue Card theoretically relates to the whole of Mugla province, north of Bodrum to just north of Kas. Find out more about requirements <a href="Members/sue/R2012-06-29-1"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There is a good anchorage east of the castle in 6-7m over black sand. Check the anchor is properly dug in as the bottom has a lot of debris scattered over it</p>
