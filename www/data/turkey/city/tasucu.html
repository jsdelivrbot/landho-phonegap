<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Tusucu is the <span>main ferry terminal to Girne, the main port of Northern Cyprus. Consequently the harbour is busy with passenger boats.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The Sand bar that extends out from Tusucu has a Cardinal Mark some distance out from the headland. It is not on the chart. A passage can be made on the inside if necessary, but a wide berth would be wise. The sea can become very rough with any moderate west wind against the tide, usually about 1kn.</span></p>
<p>A yacht on a passage East from Tusucu to Mersin cannot stop at Kum Kuyu as the port police will ask you to leave. The best option is to continue east to the town of Erdemli, 18nm West from Mersin, where a new fishing harbour has been built (2011) with plenty of room for visiting yachts.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>As well as the ferries, there are lots of Gullet's operating from this harbour, so it gets busy when they all arrive back between 5 and 6pm.</span></p>
<p>Berth stern-to on the north west side of the ferry harbour with the anchor. Both the shelter and the holding are good. Electric and water on the dock.</p>
<p>There is also a commercial harbour to the east of the town.</p>
<p><span>The anchorage to the west, Agalimani, is a very pleasant place to drop the hook, good depths and accessible any time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Good facilities ashore, no showers but good toilets.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Last updated October 2012.</span></p></div></div>
