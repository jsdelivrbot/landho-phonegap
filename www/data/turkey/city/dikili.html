<div class="hello"><div><p>A small harbour often crowded with fishing boats, but space can usually be found. Berth stern-to on the western breakwater or raft alongisde a trawler. The holding is good and so is the shelter from all directions. Might be wise to avoid if they are loading coal!</p>
<p>Harbour fees 2010 were 50 Euro (115 Turkish Lira), no water and no power.</p>
<p>Last updated June 2011.</p>
