<div class="hello"><div><p>Amasra lies about 8 miles ENE of Bartin. It is an old town catering to Turkish tourists, there are therefore plenty of restaurants and good provisioning.</p>
<p>Part of the harbour is designated as a Naval area, however cruisers report that there is no evidence of any naval vessels or facilities here.</p>
<p>Position: 41° 44.8 N 32° 23.8 E (Outer breakwater)</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large harbour and in calm weather it is possible to moor alongside or bow/stern-to at the pontoons in the NW corner of the harbour. If there is any sign of swell however (often the case), it is more comfortable and safer to anchor off in the SW part of the harbour. Keep clear of the swimming area.</p>
<p>The central pier in the south part of the harbour has been extended, and the flashing red light that is shown on the charts, might not be operational. Some pilot books show a coal loading area in this harbour, but there is now no evidence of it.</p>
