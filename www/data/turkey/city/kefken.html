<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a small fishing harbour on the Northern Turkish Coast in the Black Sea, 30nm East of Sile.</p>
<p>Position 41°10.13'N, 30°13.47E.</p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> Almost the entire area between Sile and Kefken is a Live Firing Practice area, and when active requires a significant detour as detailed on the
charts. Check with the Coast Guard in Sile or call them on VHF channel 16.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Good protection except when wind and waves are from the NW.  </p>
<p>Yachts are welcome here and can moor in the Southern part of the harbour directly alongside the concrete quay, if there is space, or to a fishing boat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is space to anchor in approx. 3-4 m. Beware of the shallow water near the beach on the East side of the harbour and rocks in the SE corner.</p>
<p>There are water taps on shore, and a slipway for hauling out the fishing boats - which most likely can assist with common repairs.</p>
