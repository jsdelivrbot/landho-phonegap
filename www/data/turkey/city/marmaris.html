<div class="hello"><div><p>Marmaris sits in the corner of a most attractive and sheltered bay. It is a busy tourist town and an important yachting centre. Very little remains of the old city after the earthquake of 50 years ago.</p>
<p>There is an active cruising community here and the <strong>Marmaris Bay Cruisers</strong> is a great way to find out about activities and events, plus a plethora of useful local information. They run a morning net - times currently Monday, Wednesday and Friday on VHF Ch. 69 from 0900 (lasting between 10-15 minutes) and their website has alot of useful information for cruisers in Turkey: <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://cruisingtips.net/mbc/">http://cruisingtips.net/mbc/</a></strong></p>

<p>All authorities are to be found on the waterfront, and are generally very helpful.</p>
<p><span>It has been reported that "passengers" clearing into Turkey in Marmaris may be subject to a "Port Tax" equivalent to USD10 when entering the country on a ferry or yacht. When clearing out no tax is levied. Crew members are exempt.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several marinas to choose from in Marmaris Bay, as well as the option to anchor. With the prevailing wind being from the west, the NW side of the bay provides the most comfortable spot. It is good holding, if you penetrate the weed and dig into the sand below.</p>
<p>In the last few years prices have increased here, so it is wise to enquire at several marinas along the coast before deciding where to haul out or berth long term.</p>
<p>A good alternative can be found in the small bay of Ciftlik, behind the rock island Ciftlik Adasi (about 8nm SSE of Marmaris). Either anchor (weed/sand bottom), or tie up to one of the many (5+) restaurant jetties. On entering the bay there are likely to be several different hosts waving their flag to attract your attention to their jetty. Many provide water, electricity and showers too. If you need to go to Marmaris for supplies, parts etc., there is a good minibus service there &amp; back twice per day from Ciftlik. A very scenic trip, and very reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Turgut (just outside the gap of Marmaris Bay) is where Ellas Restaurant is located, and offers a dock with lazy lines and boat boys to help you with mooring. The water is reported to be crystal clear here and the facilities ashore very welcoming.</p>
<p>The "Blue Card" waste disposal monitoring scheme started to be enforced here at the beginning of 2012. The Blue Card theoretically relates to the whole of Mugla province, north of Bodrum to just north of Kas. Find out more about requirements <a href="Members/sue/R2012-06-29-1">here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0px; "><strong>Note:</strong> Winter pump-outs, we have been advised, are not offered by the Turmepa boat nor is the pump out  “trolley” in Netsel in use. Instead, for Marmaris Bay, the man at Netsel who operates the fuel dock, “B” dock,  during the winter until May sometime, also pumps out grey/ black water tanks.</p>
