<div class="hello"><div><p>Karabiga Harbour is located in the Western corner of the Gulf (Korfezi in Turkish) of Erdek, on the Southern shore of the Sea of Marmara - basically opposite Marmara Island (Adasi), and is a fishing harbour able to accommodate small coasters.</p>
<p>It is a quiet, sleepy little place not much visited by tourists.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth alongside, or stern-to at the south end of the coal loading quay. The inner (fishing) basin is usually too crowded. It is also fairly shallow. The harbour gives good protection from the prevailing winds, which usually do not blow very strongly here.</p>
<p>Another option is to anchor in the NE corner of the harbour and where the breakwater provides shelter from the prevailing wind. This might be a better option if coal is being loaded at the quay.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the bay, NE of the harbour, where there is good holding in mud and sand. </p>
