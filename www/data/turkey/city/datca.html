<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour has been improved, and a pontoon covers the shallows in front of the quay wall. Berth stern-to where possible. Shelter is good, although southerlies can cause a surge at the berths, when anchoring off is a better option.</p>
<p>In the summer, this is a crowded harbour and it may be necessary to anchor off anyway, either in the north or south bay. Good holding in sand and mud.</p>
<p>The pump-out station here is reported not to have the correct fittings for small yachts to pump out.</p>
<p>Last updated August 2016.</p></div></div>
