<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts should use the north harbour. Berth alongside on the west side of the central pier.</p>
<p>In strong winds from any Westerly direction mooring alongside the western
pier might be untenable, even anchoring in the designated area in the
Western part of the harbour is uncomfortable. A better option is to try and
anchor in the fishing harbour on the east side of the central pier if there
is room, good shelter and holding. </p>
<p>The area is very popular with local fisherman in the late afternoon and early evening when the quay is very crowded. It is advisable to be on board at that time to stop them from fishing off your boat.</p>
<p>The shipyards near the harbour are a good place for most repairs.</p>
