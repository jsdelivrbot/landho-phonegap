<div class="hello"><div><p>This ancient port has a large, busy commercial harbour with a purpose-built yacht harbour and marina operated by the Samsun Sailing Club. It lies about 31 miles SE of Bafra Burnu and with direct flights to Istanbul is an excellent choice for crew changes.</p>
<p><!--Although Samsun has a long history, Genoese raiders burnt it to the ground in the 1400s, leaving very little of the old Samsun. It was here that Kemal Atatürk came ashore on May 19, 1919 to rally the people against Allied occupation and to begin the Turkish War of Independence. Visit the Archeological Museum and the Atatürk Museum. --></p>
<p>The marina is a secure place to leave your yacht if planning inland excursions.</p>
<p>Position 41° 19.4’N, 36° 20.4’E (Yacht Harbour).</p>
