<div class="hello"><div><p>Although afected by wash from passing vessels, this bay provides good shelter. Visitors will usually have to anchor although there may be a berth on the quay available.</p>
<p>There are regular buses to old Istambul which takes about half an hour, depending on the traffic.</p>
<p>An alternative stop might be at Isinye, a norrow inlet 2 miles N of Bebek, if a free berth can be found.</p>
