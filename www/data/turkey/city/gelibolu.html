<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two possible berthing areas for yachts. The eastern corner of the commercial harbour is one, and just inside the fishing harbour is the other. In each case care should be taken with the depths. There is good shelter from the wind in both harbours.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor to the east of the harbour. There is good holding in the sand and shelter from the prevailing wind.</p>
<p>The northern side of the commercial harbour has now been dredged but there are no mooring facilities on the quay. The fishing harbour has also been dredged and it is possible to berth bows-to in front of the restaurant. </p>
<p>This is a busy harbour and care needs to be taken to avoid the many ferries and fishing boats.</p>
