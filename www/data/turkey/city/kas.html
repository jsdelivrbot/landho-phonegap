<div class="hello"><div><p>Kaş (pronounced "Kash") is a small fishing, diving, yachting and tourist town, situated midway between Finike and Fethiya on a hill running down to the sea. As a tourist town it is relatively unspoiled.</p>
<p>The port is attractive, although it can be rather airless in the hottest part of the summer. </p>

<p>Customs, Police and Health Authorities are all conveniently situated near the waterfront, although visiting all the necessary offices can take a large part of the day.</p>
<p>A foreigners Police department has now opened in Kaş (located in Kas Police station), making residency applications and renewals, much more convenient. The Maliye office (where you pay your residency fees) is located in the same building.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Approach to the entrance to Kas Harbour is not easy to identify until close up, and an underwater rock nearby is marked with a buoy.</p>
<p>To moor in the harbour go stern or bows-to. Holding in the harbour is reasonable and the shelter is good. Although full of charter, dive and tourist boats, space can usually be found on the southern quay.</p>
<p>The new Kas Marina opened for yachts in Spring 2011 and is five minutes from the centre of town.</p>
