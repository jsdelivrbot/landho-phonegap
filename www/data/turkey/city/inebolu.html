<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a good, sheltered harbour, however watch out for swell in easterly winds and wash from the commercial traffic.</p>
<p>If space is available, alongside berthing is possible on the northern quay (closest to town) at the western end, but beware of the underwater rubble in the corner. It tends to be noisy here with the lorries coming and going.</p>
<p>Alternatively, anchor in mud in the southern half of the harbour, clear of the coatguard's quay. The holding is uncertain.</p>
