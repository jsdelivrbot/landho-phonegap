<div class="hello"><div><p>It may be possible to moor to the large quay, but this is directly opposite the entrance. The best option is to anchor in the southern part of the harbour. The bottom is mud in 4-5m and good holding. </p>
<p>The shelter is excellent and this makes it a good passage harbour. </p>
<p>The village is very small and no provisions are obtainable. </p>
<p>Water tap is at the north end of the quay.</p>
<p>There is a bus to Istanbul and the nearest town of Ayancik.</p>
