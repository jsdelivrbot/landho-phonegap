<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large coal mining town, about 20 miles ENE of Degirmen Burnu.</p>
<p>Only yachts with mechanical problems really bother to stop here as the harbour is dirty and unattractive. </p>
<p>A better alternative close by is the fishing harbour at <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Turkey/Filyos">Filyos</a>.</p>
<p>Position: 41º27'N, 31º46'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is little or no room for mooring. The entire east side of the harbour
is shallow with scattered underwater rocks. The space along the NW quay is
taken up by boats with official business and fishing boats. </p>
<p>Finding a friendly fisherman to tie up alongside might be the best option.</p>
<p>The coal quay in the South part of the harbour might be available for
tying-up (with permission), but it is really set-up for large ships and is an unfriendly berth for a yacht.</p>
