<div class="hello"><div><p>The fishing harbour is very busy with the fishing fleet but the security here makes this a more desirable option than the commercial harbour.</p>
<p>Yachts are best to anchor in the outer fishing harbour.</p>
<p>In the commercial harbour, the Giresun Yacht Club (now appears closed) has a small dock near the end of the inner breakwater. With permission, visiting yachts may be able to use this. This mooring is less secure than in the fishing harbour.</p>
<p>As this is a commercial port, wash can sometimes be a problem.</p>
