<div class="hello"><div><p>The archepelago and peninsula provide a large number of good, sheltered anchorages.</p>
<p>If not requiring the services provided by the large marina accross <code>The Lake</code> on the mainland, the small harbour on the southern side of the island of Alibey can make an attractive alternative destination. The water here however is not clean and definitely not for swimming.</p>
<p>Moor to the southern breakwater or, if there is room, on the northern quay close to the village. Cruisers report prices here to be high.</p>
