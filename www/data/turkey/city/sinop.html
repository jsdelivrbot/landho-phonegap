<div class="hello"><div><p>This historic fishing port often forms the eastern limit for many cruising yachts as it provides a useful point from which to cross to the Crimean Peninsula. The town centre is to a large extent surrounded by a wall (often fallen into ruins or taken down) that at some gates dates back some 2500 years.</p>
<p>Position: 42º 01'N, 35º 08'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is predominantly a fishing harbour and space is difficult for visiting yachts. Boats reported damaged by careless fishing vessels.</p>
<p>Berth in the Western harbour; either ask permission to go alongside a fishing boat or follow instructions to med-moor to the outer quay.</p>
<p>There is water on the quay and the town has most facilities.</p>
