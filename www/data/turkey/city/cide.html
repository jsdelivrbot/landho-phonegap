<div class="hello"><div><p>Some say this is one of the most beautiful parts of the Black Sea, with dramatic mountain scenery, white sandy beaches and lush forests. </p>
<p>Cide is a quiet town, and whilst not the most beautiful architecturally, the surroundings are pleasant and the harbour offers a secure place to stop for the night.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an active fishing harbour in the summer. If there is room, berth stern-to or alongside the central quay on eastern side the of the harbour.</p>
<p>For more comfort, anchoring in the southern corner is probably a better option. The holding is reported good in sand in 2.5m, but take care to avoid the weed.</p>
