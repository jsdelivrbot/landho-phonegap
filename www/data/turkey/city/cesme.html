<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/turkey-pics/turkey_cesme_approaches-mv-leeze/@@images/image/mini"/>The town of Cesme is tucked in on the western side of the peninsula of Kalem Burnu, opposite the town of Khios (Chios) on the Greek island of the same name.

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Camper &amp; Nicholson marina (opened June 2010) in the centre of Cesme provides excellent facilities and the Setur Cesme marina, on the opposite side of the peninsula, provides fully serviced berths. In addition there has now been developed another marina at Port Alacati, about 15NM south of  Cesme.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor off the town, however it is difficult to find a spot protected from the N/NW wind. There are also a few forbidden zones in this harbour.</p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/turkey-pics/turkey_cesme_town-quay_mv-leeze/@@images/image/preview"/>It may be possible to come stern-to <span>the town quay </span><span>(Med-moor using your own anchor), which gets busy with gulets and charter boats. Speak with the harbour master. There is no electricity here, but water can be delivered by tanker. The city are working on getting shore power and water to the quay. The town quay is better protected from Northerly winds but offers little protection from Southerly ones. If the wind blows hard from the South it is advisable to move to anchor in the middle of the bay or to a protected bay south of the harbour.<i> (Photo of town quay courtesy of MV LeeZe, June 2014).</i></span></p>
<p>There are several good anchorages in the area.</p>
