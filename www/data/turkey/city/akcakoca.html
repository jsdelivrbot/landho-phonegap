<div class="hello"><div><p>This small fishing harbour is well sheltered by breakwaters, but is exposed in strong NW winds. </p>
<p>The depths in the harbour appear shallow, so care should be taken when entering. Alternatively, anchor just outside in settled weather.</p>
<p>Berth stern-to on the NE quay or alongside a fishing boat.</p>
<p>With the presence of a fishing fleet here, basic repairs can likely be carried out.</p>
