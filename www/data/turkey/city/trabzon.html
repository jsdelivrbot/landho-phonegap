<div class="hello"><div><p>Trabzon was founded around 1.000 B.C. and was an important trading post on the historic Silk Road. Today it is the most important city in the region. Lying close to Cuzelhisar Burnu, the Eastern Black Sea mountains form an impressive backdrop to the city.</p>
<p>Trabzon is famous for its anchovies (<i>hamsi</i>), and its major exports are hazelnuts and tea. The interior from Trabzon is well worth exploring, in particular a visit to the dramatic Sümela Monastery (50km south), which clings to the side of a very steep mountain. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>As a busy port, Trabzon has four harbours and it's possible for visiting yachts to berth in three of these, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. <i>Trabzonspor</i> is the Yacht Harbour and <i>Yalimahalle</i> the fishing harbour.</p>
<p><i>Yalimahalle</i><br>
This is to the west of the commercial harbour. Yachts are allowed to berth in the fishing harbour. It is very close to the city, which is just across the coastal highway. </br></p>
<p><i>Commercial Harbour</i><br>
Easily spotted by the cranes and ships. The inner harbour in the SE corner is suitable for visiting yachts. Go alongside the quay as directed by officials. Water can be arranged by the harbourmaster.  </br></p>
<p><i>Note: There is a small fishing harbour between the commercial harbour and Trabzonspor. This is for local boats only.</i></p>
<p><i>Trabzonspor</i><br>
Situated 2nm East of the commercial harbour, next to the airport, this is noted as a "yacht harbour" but it is believed that visiting yachts are not really welcomed. If wishing to enter, it is necessary to call this private harbour in advance. There are no facilities. </br></p>
