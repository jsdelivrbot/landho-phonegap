<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-left" src="Countries/FinikeMarina_Location.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Finike is a small commercial port in a market-garden growing area. It is especially well known for its citrus fruits due to its especially mild climate.</p>
<p>The marina here is a popular place to spend the winter for many liveaboards. <span>As well as the marina being in a traditional Turkish provincial town it is also only three hours drive from Saklikent Ski Resort. The Lycean Way coastal path goes through Finike and some excellent walking trails are to be found locally as well as many ancient ruins from the Roman and Lycean period.</span></p>
