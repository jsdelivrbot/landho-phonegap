<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a large commercial harbour and a large number of ships are likely to be at anchor in the vicinity. Also, beware of the unlit buoys within the harbour.
The city centre in the old port is a maze of narrow streets lined with shops and cafes. </p>

<p>The Harbour Office overlooks the fishing harbour entrance and is the signing-in point. It is closed weekends. The Transit Log paperwork has now all been transferred to a new complex in the Mersin International Port (MIP) offices on the north east side of the main harbour, two miles from the fishing harbour.</p>
<p>Ask for the Harbourmaster’s (liman başkanligi) office; the Health office is next door and the Immigration office in the ferry terminal opposite. Customs is through the main gate under the big MIP sign between the Harbourmaster and Immigration.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth in the fishing harbour in the SW corner of the commercial harbour. There may be space to go stern-to on the NW or SW quays, raft up to an un-used fishing boat. The harbour is noisy with the funfair, tannoys and disco gulets providing a less than quiet night. It is a 10 minute walk to the old town.</p>
<p>The new marina, 5 miles to the west, was inaugurated at the end of November 2011. This is intended to be a full service marina, however noonsite cannot confirm what services are currently operating. This is a safe place to leave the boat for a shore trip. Its suroundings are unattractive.</p>
