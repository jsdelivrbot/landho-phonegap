<div class="hello"><div><p>This small holiday town lies about 21 miles east of the Bosphorous. It is a favourite resort for the residents of Istanbul and at the weekends can be especially crowded.</p>
<p>Position: 41º10'N, 29º36'E. </p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> Almost the entire area between Sile and Kefken is a Life Firing Practice area, and when active requires a significant detour as detailed on the charts. Check with the Coast Guard in Sile or call them on VHF channel 16.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Cruising guides comment that the entrance to the harbour can be dangerous due to silting and in strong on shore winds. However cruisers report June 2011 that on entry there was plenty of water under the keel, and some good size fishing boats use the harbour.</p>
<p>Good shelter here for almost all conditions.</p>
<p>Most of the space on the North East quay is taken up by fishing boats. There are also 3 restaurant boats moored here and at least one large tour boat. If the remaining available space is not occupied by fishing boats, yachts can berth stern-to. </p>
<p>It might be possible to anchor in the harbour, but depths should be checked. </p>
<p>The water tap is on the quay, near the harbourmaster's office.</p>
<p>The walk to town is slightly uphill, but the effort is rewarded by good
shopping, restaurants and bars. Great shopping for locally produced cotton
clothing. Hazelnuts are sold everywhere!</p>
