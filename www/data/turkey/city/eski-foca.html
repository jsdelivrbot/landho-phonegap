<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a port of Entry from mid-May to September end only, however it is not recommended as a clearance port as the various authorities are not all located in the town. <span>There is one travel agency that can sell you a transit log and they may or may not have any on hand when you need it. To get one, either you, or they, have to travel to Izmir (64km away) to buy one. There is no agent in town to assist with the clearance process, so you must do it yourself. The Health Police are located in Aliaga (42km away). Read the report adjacent about clearance here for full details.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Visiting yachts are </span><span>authorised to anchor within 300 yards of  38° 40.380’N,  026° 44.880’E.</span></p>
<p>If anchoring on the west side, ensure the anchor is well dug in as the bottom is not the best holding and the bay shelves quickly to 20m or so.</p>
<p><span>There are some visitors' berths on the quay in front of the town on the east side of the bay. The trawlers berthed at the northern end provide additional shelter. See comment below about this informal "marina". </span></p>
