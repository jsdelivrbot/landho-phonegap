<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Marmara lies on the SW corner of the large, mountainous island of Marmara Adasi. White marble is mined on the northern side of the island and is well-known for its purity. Unfortunately this does mean that the area surrounding the port is an open pit mine and not a pretty sight. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>It is a very crowded harbour and yachts are usually directed to berth on the northern quay, where care must be taken to avoid the underwater rubble. </p>
<p>There is excellent shelter here.</p>
<p>Anchoring is also possible in the bay, good holding and shelter from all winds except Northwest.</p>
