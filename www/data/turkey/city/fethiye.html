<div class="hello"><div><p>The town of Fethiye is situated on the southern shore of the bay of Fethiye Adasi and is reasonably sheltered from the prevailing winds. </p>
<p>Once a very small, pretty fishing village, Fethiye has grown considerably over the last 10 years but still boasts a "small town" aura. The winding hillside streets, the teeming farmer’s market, the lovely little tea shops (filled with old men playing backgammon and smoking their hookahs) all add to its charm. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a marina by the town (Ece Saray Marina) and three mini-marinas further around the bay. Cruisers advise that if you want a proper marina that's cheaper than Ece Saray, but not as strict as Yacht Classic, then go 300 metres further to "Yes Marina".</p>
<p>All marinas are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> It is possible to anchor for free in the huge bay which offers good protection from the prevailing winds, but take care that your anchor penetrates the weed. In some areas of the bay the quality of the holding is patchy.</p>
<p>One good anchorage is close to Ece Marina in front of Classic Yacht Hotel/marina in 15m over mud.</p>
<p>Another good, quiet, pretty anchorage is in the NW corner of the bay, behind the wreck. Although it is some way from the town, it is away from the loud music broadcast from the shoreside bars.. There is a water tap on the beach here.</p>
<p>The harbour office is opposite the pier used by the gulets. Well over 100 of these go out full everyday in the high season to the nearby islands.</p>
<p>The nearby islands are a delightful cruising ground to simply island-crawl up the coast. Watch out for the waterborne Turkish pancake makers who slide up alongside your boat and cook up delicious pancakes on the spot!</p>
<p><strong>Security Update May 2012:</strong> Reports of break-in and theft (after dark when the boat was unoccupied) have been received from boats in Aksazlar Bay, just north of Fethiye Ece Marina.</p>
<p>The "Blue Card" waste disposal monitoring scheme started to be enforced at the beginning of 2012. The Blue Card theoretically relates to the whole of Mugla province, north of Bodrum to just north of Kas.

      Very nicely situated with a "Wellness" centre and great facilities. Town is just a few minutes further than from Ece Marina. 25 berths. Water, electricity, showers, toilets, laundry, pool, WiFi, bar and restaurant. Bear in mind this is a hotel/restaurant with a 30 boat jetty, therefore berthing rates are reduced if you eat at the restaurant - which is of course preferred.
