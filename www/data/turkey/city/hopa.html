<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry - the last place to clear out of Turkey if heading to Georgia or beyond. On arrival the authorities will deal with clearance, however with very few yachts visiting here they are not familiar with the procedure for small craft.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This harbour offers good shelter and visiting yachts can berth in the inner harbour. Options are either to go alongside the cement quay or anchor in the NE part of the harbour. The authorities may direct you to a suitable place.</p>
<p>As this is a commercial port, wash from the large ship movements is inevitable.</p>
<p>The port is about a mile and a half from the small town.</p>
