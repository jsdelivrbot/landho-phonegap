<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a most attractive town in a magnificent setting. The old town has been restored and this makes it a delightful place to wander around. It used to be a very popular over-wintering place for yachts, however cruisers in 2015 report that most boats moored here are Turkish now.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Turkey/Kemer">Kemer</a></strong> is another option for airport transfers as well as Antalya.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two marinas at Antalya. Setur (previously Celebi) marina, situated in the commercial harbour, 5 miles SW of the city, and the smaller Kaleici marina in the old harbour.</p>
<p>Whilst Setur has excellent shelter, facilities and friendly staff, it is some distance from the town and the bus service unreliable. The old harbour, whilst in the centre of town, is exposed to some swell in southerly gales.</p>
