<div class="hello"><div><p>Guarding the western entrance to the Bosphosus, Istanbul bridges the divide between Europe and Asia. Its thousands of years of history make it an unmissable stop if cruising this part of the Mediteranean. The Golden Horn is the name given to its harbour.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Marinas</b></p>
<p>There are several marinas in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Setur Kalamis has an adjacent yacht harbour, Fenerbahce marina. This marina is on the southern shore, SE of the old city.</p>
<p>Atakoy, is on the northern shore, west of the city.</p>
<p>Marinturk Istanbul "City Port" is situated in Pendik, next to Tuzla.</p>
<p>West Istanbul Marina and Marina Istanbul located in Buyukcekmece Bay opened in 2012. Whilst these are further from the city centre, they tend to be inexpensive and uncrowded and getting into Istanbul is easy by public transport.</p>
<p><b>Anchorages</b></p>
<p>There is not really a safe anchorage in the vicinity of Istanbul. The bay at Bebek, midway between the two suspension bridges over the Bosphorus, is the nearest.</p>
<p>Karakoy is <strong>not</strong> a safe place to berth.</p>
<p>On approach, beware of the ferry traffic crossing from one side to the other.</p>
<p>When proceeding up the Bosphorus, VTS must be monitored on the appropriate VHF channel. See <a href="Countries/Turkey?a=Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> for details.</p>
