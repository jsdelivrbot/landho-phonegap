<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Orhaniye is a large bay at the head of the Gulf of Hisaronu, of which Keci Buku (</span><span>Position 36°46.7'N, 28°06.98'E)</span><span> is a very small, attractive village situated in a long, narrow inlet at the mouth of the bay, with Marti Marina on the east side. </span></p>
<p><span>At the head of the bay is Orhaniye village which backs up the valley. At the waters edge surrounding the head of the bay are 5 restaurant jetties all offering varied facilities to yachts that dock there.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a good range of mooring options here.</p>
<p><b>Anchorages</b></p>
<p><span>There are three main anchorages in Orhaniye/Keci Buku. Just off the Dogan Hotel (offers the most cooling breezes) and either behind the island or at the head of the bay. You should be cautious of the 250m sand spit ‘Kiz Kumu’ which projects on the east side in a largely North/South direction. During the summer it is marked by red and white floating buoys, as well as the parading tourists.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Marinas/Docks</b></span></p>
<p>Marti Marina is located on the east side of the bay and Palmiye Marina at the head of the bay.</p>
<p><span>At the waters edge surrounding the head of the bay are 5 restaurant/hotel jetties. Going clockwise they are Palmiye Marina, Kadir restaurant, Iskele restaurant, Ersoy restaurant, and finally Buk restaurant. Iskele and Ersoy have pensions. Water and electricity is available at all jetties.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Palmiye and Marti Marinas are different to all the others in Orhaniye in that they have full permission from the Ministry of Tourism, so can accommodate private and charter yachts through the winter months, offering guardianage, service and bond facilities, fuel and Blue card pump out. <span>The Palmiye hotel jetty recently gained full Turkish marina status. For the last two years access has been difficult because the jetty was occupied by Sunsail charter yachts. Sunsail are downsizing their Turkish operation so the path is now clear for private yachts for the 2014 season. <span>Sunsail leave Palmiye Marina at end of March 2014.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>There are two further restaurant jetties, Begonville, which is placed half way between Marti and Palmiye, just north of the Kiz Kumu sand bar, and Dogan Hotel which is adjacent to Marti Marina. Both offer good quality facilities including toilets, showers, Wi-Fi, restaurant and bar.</span></p>
<p>Since 2005 there has been the occasional report of theft from yachts at Marti Marina, in particular those at anchor. The most recent report received was summer 2011. It is recommended to lock up and avoid leaving your boat unattended at night.</p>
<p>Last updated July 2013.</p></div></div>
