<div class="hello"><div><p>Kalkan lies some 70NM SE of Marmaris and is a useful base from which to visit Patara and Xanthos. The old village, abandoned after the 1958 earthquake, is now being refurbished. The new village is on the higher ground behind.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The nearest foreigners' Police department is a two and </span><span>a half hour drive away, in Kemer. However, </span>a foreigners <span>department will open in Kaş at the end of January 2013 (located in Kas Police station), </span>making residency applications and renewals, much more convenient. T<span>he Maliye office (where you pay your r</span><span>esidency fees), is located in the same building in Kaş.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour is at the NE end of Kalkan Bay. On approach it is not easy to see the breakwater to the harbour or the buildings of Kalkan until you are right inside the bay. When mooring go stern or bows-to and although the bottom is sand, holding is not safe anywhere.  Good shelter but the southerly winds cause an uncomfortable surge inside the harbour.</p>
<p>Due to the harbour being rather narrow, anchors often get tangled here. The bottom is sand, but the holding is rather variable.</p>
<p>Water and electricity available. Toilet and shower block on the quay and their use atracts an additional charge.</p>
<p>The rules on discharging waste are strictly enforced here and heavy fines may be levied.</p>
