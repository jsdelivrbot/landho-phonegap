<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is 'work in progress' with no services or facilities yet and because of that, mooring is free at present. There is good protection in the 'marina' with its high sea walls. Depth is over 4m.</p>
<p><span>A water truck </span><a href="tel:%28%2B90%20532%20654%209130" target="_blank">(+90 532 654 9130</a><span>) will deliver up to 10 tons of water.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Further west are two nice spots to anchor: Urla and Çesmealti. Although they both have quays, neither town has mooring space for visitors.</span></span></p>
