<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a quiet, rural district relying on agriculture for its local economy. With beautiful forests it has been "earmarked" as a potential tourist resort.</p>
<p>Located 18nm West of Mersin, this is a good place to stop and break up the passage from Tusucu to Mersin. A new fishing harbour was completed here in 2011 with plenty of space for visiting yachts.</p>
<p><span>On approach the new sea wall will be seen, fitted with navigation lights. There is plenty of depth.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>New fishing port and working area building boats. Moor stern-to with anchor wherever there is space on the west side. the north side is or fishing boats.</span></p>
<p><span>There is room to anchor in the middle of the harbour if preferred. This is a very sheltered port in all weathers.</span></p>
<p><span>The Port is run as a co-operative with the fishermen. There is a security post on the main gate and very helpful staff who will assist. Not much English spoken. </span></p>
<p>Charges 2012 were 10 lira per night, with sporadic electricity. Water is available and supermarkets are just up the dusty road, in the town. It is a working port so some noise is inevitable.</p>
<p>There is a clean private beach, just east of the port, where you can swim for 5 Lira each including sun loungers.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Market day is Tuesday, a five minute walk from the port. Everything is available within walking distance from the port.</p>
