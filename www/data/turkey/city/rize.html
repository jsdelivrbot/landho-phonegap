<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts are best berthing in the fishing harbour, which lies just to the south of the commercial harbour and nearer the centre of the town. </p>
<p>In the <i>Commercial Harbour</i> berth as directed by the Harbourmaster or failing that, med-moor to the small stone jetty in the SW corner of the harbour.</p>
<p>The <i>Fishing Harbour</i> is more comfortable and sheltered. On entry ask permission to anchor or pick up a mooring and tie back to one of the boat sheds that line three sides of the harbour. </p>
<p>This is a provincial capital, therefore everything is available in the city. </p>
<p>For repairs, ask at the port office in the commercial harbour. </p>
