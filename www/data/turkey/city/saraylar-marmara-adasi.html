<div class="hello"><div><p>The downside of this, is the fact that marble is still loaded from here, causing a lot of dust and noise. </p>
<p>The best mooring is on the new marble quay on the east side of the harbour.</p>
<p>An alternative option is to anchor in the bay, to the north of the town or in the cove to the east.</p>
<p>There is good shelter here.</p>
<p>Water is very limited and fuel is not always available either.</p>
<p>A few provisions are available in the village.</p>
