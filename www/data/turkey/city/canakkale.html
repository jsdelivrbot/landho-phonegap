<p><span>This google earth image <span>shows the commercial ferry dock on the left, with a small harbour adjacent which is for fishermen (who also tend to use the larger harbour as well). </span></span></p>
<p><span>The yacht marina tucked inside the curved breakwater is a city marina, therefore facilities are basic.

<p><span><span>There are plans to make another finger pier in 2015, with more spots for larger boats. Lazy lines have been strengthened in Autumn 2014.</span></span></p>

      The marina in the SW corner of the main harbour is very reasonably priced compared to other Turkish marinas. Fuel, water and electricity in the marina. Tight security.<br>
Not a suitable place to leave a boat unattended due to the constant need to attend to the mooring warps.
