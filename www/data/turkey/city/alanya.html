<div class="hello"><div><p>Alanya is a seaside resort located on the eastern side of the Gulf of Antalya. It is 120 kilometres from the city of Antalya. It is an attractive, all year, town with a castle and many historical sites in the vicinity.  </p>
<p>The old village has almost remained untouched by the later development now surrounding it.</p>
<p>The new marina that opened here at the end of 2009 facilitates cruising eastwards to Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon &amp; Israel.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The old breakwater has been extended NE and a new breakwater built out from the beach towards the SE, forming a protected anchorage which has been dredged.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor just to the NE of the harbour.</p>
<p>The new marina has been built about 3NM NW of the town. In the past the marina suffered considerably from reflected swell when the wind is from a S/SW direction (in particular during the winter months). For the winter of 2011/12 Alanya marina completed the installation of anti-surge protectors, which cruisers report seem to be effective. Over the winter of 2012/13 a protective breakwater was built and the marina report it seems to be working well in stopping the swell.</p>
