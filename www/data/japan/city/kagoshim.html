<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a <code>marina</code> next to Kagoshima Marine Services (KMS) at Taniyama.</p>
<p>Yachts moor in this well-protected cut off from the main harbour. Mooring is bow or stern-to the wall (tide is 2 to 3m), using buoys, mooring lines and foam fenders that are already in place. Each mooring slot has its own tiny raft on which you pull yourself to the nearest ladder in the harbour wall. </p>
