<p>This is a Port of Entry and either of the marinas will notify the officials of your arrival. They will then visit the boat to do the paperwork.</p>
<p>This has to be done even if you have already cleared into the county.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is well marked and can be entered at night.</p>
<p>The two marinas here are on the western side of the city, in the Nishi district. The newer one, Marinoa marina is more secure but berthing fees are higher. It is easily identified by the ferris wheel. The Fukuoka City Yacht Harbour is just a little further west, round the headland.</p>
<p>Fukuoka is a vibrant city and most goods and services are available.</p>
