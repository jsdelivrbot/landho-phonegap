<div class="hello"><div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Japan/Nagasaki/Countries/Japan?rc=Formalities">Japan Formalities</a></strong><span> for detailed clearance information.</span></p>
<p>This port must be visited first to clear into Okinawa.</p>
<p>It is important to call the Coast Guard 24 hours before arrival and fax the required forms to the Coast Guard, <span>Customs and the Naha Port Authority</span>. The <span>Coast Guard will give you the exact GPS location as to where you must wait for officials to board for clearance. </span></p>
<p><span>All government officials will want to come on board, so </span><span>be prepared to fill in a serious amount of paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>In addition, you have to visit the Ministry of Land Office in Naha city to receive permission to enter any closed ports (like Ginowan). It takes 10 - 15 minutes by taxi to get there from the Port. Permission will take at least half a day, so you may have to visit the office twice.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to </span><span> Ginowan Marina to complete clearance. The commercial port has no suitable berths for yachts.</span></p>
