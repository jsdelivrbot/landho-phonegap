<div class="hello"><div><p>Shimoda is a tourist destination. A modern version of the black ships shuttles tourists to beautiful white sand beaches. The town is famous for its Ryokans (Japanese traditional hotels) and Onsens (Hot Springs). </p>
<p>Although Shimoda appears to offer a protected anchorage it is not a safe place to be on a boat should a typhoon strike. </p>
