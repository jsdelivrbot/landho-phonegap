<div class="hello"><div><p><span></span>This archipelago<span> of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands lie in the Pacific Ocean some <span>540 miles south of<span> </span>Honshu.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you are voyaging to Japan from the East it is a natural Port of<span> </span>Entry to Japan. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Because the Ogasawara Islands ha</span></span><span>ve never been connected to a continent, many of their animals and plants have undergone unique evolutionary processes. For this reason t</span><span>he islands are often referred to as the</span><span> </span><i>'Galapagos of the Orient'</i><span></span><span>and in 2011 gained World Heritage Natural Site listing. </span><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"></sup></p>
<p><span>The islands have an interesting history being claimed by<span> </span>various countries, with the first permanent settlement established by<span> </span>ex-whalers from the USA in the 1830s. The islands changed sovereignty a couple of times through various colonial period machinations and Pacific activities of the second world war, with them being returned<span> </span>to Japan in<span> </span>1968.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Ogasawara</b> is the administrative center of the island group, with most<span> </span>major government agencies centered here. </span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Ogasawara has the intriguing status of being both a closed port<span> </span>and a port of entry. Upon entry the Coast Guard will direct you to a<span> </span>slot on the concrete pier (fender well) and then you will be visited by all the normal government representatives.</span></p>
<p><span>At least 24hrs notice of arrival is required as per regular first<span> </span>entry to Japan, and having a list prepared for your following ports<span> </span>within Japan with marina names etc. will smooth the paperwork no end.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The port in Ogasawara (Futami Ko) is home to both the fishing and tourist boat<span> </span>industries and is all concrete docks.  Some charts show a sector light for<span> </span>port entrance, this was not functioning in July 2014.  The local Coast<span> </span>Guard office in Ogasawara does not stock Japanese charts for sale or duplication, so ensure you have charts with you for your landfall in<span> </span>the main island chain.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that a resident local high pressure system offers some<span> </span>insulation from typhoons that regularly visit the main island chain,<span> </span>however the port is somewhat open to the west, so typhoon activity in<span> </span>that area may make the port uncomfortable and at times untenable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The islands are serviced by<span> </span>a twice weekly ferry from Tokyo, their only commercial passenger link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Toilet facilities abound on the island, all being clean, lit and</span><br/><span>safe, with two public outdoor showers at the beaches, the</span><br/><span>closest being 10min walk from the main harbour, making a day ending </span><span>swim and shower a nice precursor to dinner at one of the many great </span><span>local restaurants and bars on the way back to the boat.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fees:</strong> The cruiser who passed on this port information was not charged <span>a docking fee for his stay, however it was unclear if this was policy to offer short term visitors a free stay, or if the language barrier made it a difficult subject to approach.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>A note re. Rubbish Disposal</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Most prefectures in Japan separate their rubbish prior to disposal. To<span> </span>save yourself a very messy job on arrival, try to organise your<span> </span>rubbish into the following categories en route;<span> </span><br/> - plastic PET drink<span> </span>bottlers;<span> </span><br/> - tin cans;<br/> - aluminum cans;<span> </span><br/> - general waste.</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst the exact<span> </span>categories may vary slightly from prefecture to prefecture, sorting as<span> </span>you go into these four groups should make things easier on arrival.</span></p>
