<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a well-sheltered harbour with several outlying breakwaters.</p>
<p>There is a 500ft floating pier with 3.5m at LW. If there is no space here, it is possible to use the harbour wall, but it is advisable to use a breast anchor to keep off it.</p>
<p>The harbour is safe in a typhoon, but plenty of rope is needed.</p>
<p>Locally, there are good mechanics and plenty of hardware stores and supermarkets.</p>
