      The location is not inspiring a large highway flyover serves as the backdrop and the pontoons are a bit rickety, but the location is exceptionally well-protected and it may be possible to negotiate a much lower price here than at other marinas. No showers; public bath (sento) close by. Haulout possible: a crane visits every two weeks or so. The marina is also a working boatyard, run by Japanese yachting legend
Katsuichi Nozaki and his son Kosuke. Very friendly, helpful people with good English.

      Smaller than Shin Nishinomiya it has all facilities and welcomes
foreigners, but local yachties complain that it can be subject to the wake of passing ships, located as it is in the heart of Osaka's dockland.
