<p>VHF is not normally used by yachts in Japan and you may not get an answer if you use it. Channel 16 is used for a lot of general chatter.</p>
<p>There is no GSM network in Japan. Renting is the most economical way for the average traveler to get a phone, and typically requires a picture ID and a credit card. Many companies have kiosks at the airports, while other companies will mail a phone to your hotel or to your home. You can return the phones at the airport or through the mail, depending on the company.  International calls are not possible from the majority of public phones.</p>
<p>SIM cards are not available to foreigners.</p>

      Organized and managed by Chokokai, an association of long distance voyagers in Japan. The first rally ran in the Autumn of 2013. It has since been repeated annually in the Seto Inalnd Sea, with both foreign and Japanese boats. In 2016 the rally was cancelled due to lack of participants. It is hoped it will run again in 2017 and 2018. Interested cruisers should e-mail Chokokai at the email address above.
