            </h2>
<div><p>Initial entry into Japan must be made at an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p>The JCG (Japan Coastguard) requires all vessels to report at least 24 hours before arrival with the following details: name, type and flag of vessel, port of registry and gross tonnage, details of captain and crew, port of entry and ETA, subsequent ports within Japan, previous 4 ports of call with dates and details of radio call signs, and phone numbers for communication with JCG.</p>
<p>This should be done preferably by phone or fax. The form can be downloaded (in English) from  <a href="http://www.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/apply/hoan00_e.htm"><strong>http://www.kaiho.mlit.go.jp</strong></a> and faxed or emailed to the relevant JCG office.</p>
<p>On entering the first port in Japan, it is advisable for a yacht to change its status from 'special ship' to 'coastal ship'. This change then exempts the yacht from having to register with Customs when moving from one <span>regional division to another on each entry and departure. It is important to register change the status back to 'special ship' with Customs at the last port of departure from Japan.</span></p>
<p><span>Ports in Japan are divided into closed ports and open ports. Closed ports are not normally open to yachts, however. there are 5 such closed ports where yachts may enter with prior permission.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a website with information for yachts wanting to visit closed ports: <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.mlit.go.jp/en/maritime/specialpermission.html">http://www.mlit.go.jp/en/maritime/specialpermission.html</a></b></span></p>
<p>For more useful information on Port Clearance procedures for foreign yachts see <strong><a href="http://cruisingjapan.org/mediawiki/wiki1/index.php?title=Formality">http://cruisingjapan.org</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>If entering a port without prior notice, then it is important to report to the nearest JCG office immediately.</p>
<p><span>The formalities are time-consuming as there are lots of forms to fill in, but this is mostly routine and officials are always very friendly and courteous. On entry, inspections will be carried out by Quarantine, Customs and Immigration, and maybe also the Maritime Safety Agency (coastguard). A de-ratting certificate must be shown. If there is not a de-ratting certificate, then the yacht is checked by inspectors.</span></p>
<p>The Customs, Immigration and Quarantine offices are normally in the same building in the main harbour - sometimes one can tie up to their jetty to complete the formalities. They will advise on the best berth or anchorage. Sometimes they will come to the yacht, if not the captain should go to their offices.</p>
<p>If the yachts status is not changed to 'coastal ship' then clearance with Coast guard, Customs and Immigration must be carried out at every port, although this is routine and a question of filling out a lot of forms. The last port may telephone ahead to the next port to notify them of a yacht's arrival.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the number can be obtained from the last Customs office and telephone yourself on arrival. If arriving at a weekend officials may decide only to come on Monday, but it is best to attempt to arrive on a weekday as Immigration cannot be done on weekends.</p>
<p>If a place does not have a Customs office, check in and out at the local police station (Koban); in these places the Maritime Safety Agency may check the yacht themselves. The Maritime Safety Agency office can often be a useful source of local information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to use an agent, although they can assist with entry to ports and marinas, clearance, plus overcome the language barrier. There is just a lot of form-filling.</p>

<div><p>Firearms and ammunition must be declared on arrival and the penalty for non-declaration is imprisonment. Arms will be sealed on board or kept in custody ashore.</p>
<p>Cruising yachts can get tax free fuel by filling out the Customs form C1260 at any Customs office. Give it to the company you buy the fuel from and you should have all taxes removed (including the road tax).</p>
<p>It is illegal to bring into Japan some over-the-counter medicines commonly used in other countries, including inhalers and some allergy and sinus medications <b>unless</b> <span>prescribed by a doctor.</span>. Specifically, products that contain stimulants (medicines that contain Pseudoephedrine, such as Actifed, Sudafed, and Vicks inhalers), or Codeine are prohibited <strong>unless</strong> prescribed by a doctor.</p>
<p>Generally, up to one month's supply of allowable prescription medicine can be brought into Japan. Visitors must bring a copy of their doctor's prescription as well as a letter stating the purpose of the drug.</p>
<p>If wishing to carry more than one month's supply (except prohibited drugs and controlled drugs), or are carrying syringes (pumps), are required to obtain a so-called "Yakkan Shoumei", or an import certificate in advance, and show the "Yakkan Shoumei" certificate with your prescription medicines at the Customs.</p>
<p>Decisions on what medications may be imported legally into Japan are made by the Japanese Government, and unfortunately, a comprehensive lists of specific medications or ingredients is available only from the Japanese authorities, difficult to obtain and subject to change.</p>

<div><p>A number of ports are closed to yachts, such as Urakawa (in the SE of Hokkaido), and these can only be entered in an emergency.</p>
<p>VHF Channel 16 is primarily a shipping communications channel and should only be used in an emergency.</p>
<p><em>Navigation</em> Day-sailing is recommended along the Japanese coastlines due to the very high concentration of shipping and the innumerable fishing boats, nets and aquaculture projects. Along the Hokkaido coast a hazard are the salmon nets, up to 1000 m long and lying very close to the surface.</p>
<p>Currents can be very strong in the Inland Sea, especially at the entrances, where they may reach 6-8 knots.</p>
<p>In some parts of Tokyo, including Chiyoda-ku, smoking on the streets is prohibited. Those caught are liable for an on-the-spot fine.</p>
<p><strong>Rubbish Disposal</strong></p>
<p>Most prefectures in Japan separate their rubbish prior to disposal. To save yourself a very messy job on arrival, try to organise your rubbish into the following categories en route; <br/>- plastic PET drink bottlers; <br/>- tin cans;<br/>- aluminum cans; <br/>- general waste.</p>
<p>Whilst the exact categories may vary slightly from prefecture to prefecture, sorting as you go into these four groups should make things easier on arrival.</p></div>
