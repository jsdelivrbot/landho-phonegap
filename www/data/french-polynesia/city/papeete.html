<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Papeete</strong></p>
<p>You must call the Port Control Traffic Tower (Vigi Du Port) to get authorisation from the port authorities on VHF Channel 12:</p>
<p>A. Before entering or exiting the pass of Papeete (call 10 minutes before entry or exit);<br/><span>B. Before mooring at Papeete Yachts Quay Pontoons or Papeete Marina;<br/></span><span>C. Before any movement in the Papeete habour area;<br/></span><span>D. Before crossing the east and west side of the airport runway ends. Call 5 minutes before each crossing. Wait for the "green light" from harbour control;<br/></span><span>E. Before using the Lagoon channel, going to, or coming from Marina Taina area (forbidden at night).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Anchoring is strictly forbidden in Papeete harbour area (including in front of the church), however sailing yachts can drop anchor in the very outer limits of Taina and Faa'a navigation channel. Anchor lights must be switched on at night and yachts must be prepared to move if asked by harbour control.</span></span></p>
<p>The anchorage in Maeva bay, in front of the Beachcomber Hotel, on the West coast (close to the airport),  is used by some yachts staying longer. However this anchorage is remote from all facilities, not practical for dinghy landing and some thefts have been reported on unoccupied boats.</p>
<p>The Tahiti Water Ski Club (ski nautique club de Tahiti) uses the Maeva anchorage, so boats should take care not to anchor or drive dinghies through their waterski area.</p>
<p><span><strong>Docking</strong></span></p>
<p><b><i>Papeete Marina </i></b><br/>This new marina opened in April 2015. It is advisable to try and arrive at the marina during office opening hours (see listing below) as an access card is required to get on and off the pontoons, only available from the marina office. No reservations are possible during high season, first come - first served. The marina office will want to see the boat registration and insurance. The marina operates on pre-payment only, therefore less than a one month stay the berth has to be paid for on the first day. For a several month stay, berthing has to be paid the first day of each month.</p>
<p><b><i>Town Quay</i></b><br/>Visiting yachts can also dock stern to the quay (with water and electricity) along Boulevard Pomare, a busy avenue in the heart of Papeete. Hurricane chains have been laid in the harbour and occasionally yachts foul their anchor on them. Guards patrol the quay 24/7.</p>
<p>Although both options in Papeete harbour can be noisy, most people prefer to stay here as it is only a few steps from the market, post office, banks, restaurants, repair facilities and the various offices.</p>
<p><span><strong>Outside Papeete</strong></span></p>
<p>Visiting sailing yachts mostly anchor or moor off<i> <strong>Marina <strong>T</strong></strong><strong>aina</strong>.</i> This is located<strong> </strong> on Tahiti's west coast, about 5NM from Papeete town centre, and is administered by the Papeete Port Authority. All dock spaces are occupied by local yachts, although there are a few visitor’s berths which should be booked a long time in advance, plus a visitor's quay for large yachts.</p>
<p>There are many mooring buoys just south and north of the marina, labelled with the letter "C", on a first come first served basis. Be aware however that whilst these moorings are checked every 3 months, they are of poor quality and have been known to break in heavy swells and high winds. Mooring fees should be paid at the Marina Taina office. <span>Water, fuel, laundry and garbage disposal services and use of the dinghy dock are all included.</span></p>
<p>Anchoring nearby (15 to 18m depth, but good holding) can be tight if crowded, and winds can gust up to 35/40 kts during squalls or during the Ma’aramu season (SE trade wind blowing from June to September) – beware of your scope when anchoring!</p>
<p><span>There are 3 good supermarkets within walking distance of the marina which are very practical when provisioning for long passages.</span></p>
<p>The <strong><i>Tahiti Nautic Center Marina</i> </strong>is located on the isthmus between Tahiti Nui and Tahiti Iti (about 35 NM SW of Papeete). It has haulout and repair facilities.</p>

      Call Michel, the president on the VHF in Maeva Beach anchorage. This association was created in 1981 to help visiting cruising sailors and to protect the rights of sailors in French Polynesia. Since 97, the association tries to keep the Maeva Beach anchorage open to passing boats. It can also inform you about the "etiquette" in the anchorage and the latest security and theft problems. The
association organizes and promotes events like
nautical flea markets, beach cleanups, potlucks,
boat parades, etc. It maintains close contacts
with the written press and local television to
inform the local population about cruising, living
aboard, rallies and other cruising related info. AVP maintains a trash disposal container at the disposition of cruisers who are welcome to join the association or give a
donation.

      Located in Arue, 5 km east of Papeete, the Tahiti Yacht Club is a welcoming and friendly yacht club with an active racing fleet. The Club docks are full with local boats, and often do not have spaces for visitors; anchoring space is also limited, so one should contact the club first on VHF channel 6 and ask for advice. The manager, Michel Alcon, is very helpful.
