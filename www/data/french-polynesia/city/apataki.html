<p>SY Morning Dove went aground on the reef on the SSW side of Apataki Atoll in May 2016. Read the news report <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/french-polynesia-morning-dove-lost-on-tuamotu-reef">here</a></b>.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is no safe anchorage near the village in prevailing winds.</p>
<p>There is however a calm anchorage in 25ft. of coral sand close to the pearl farms in the SE corner of the lagoon. Pearl farm families will welcome you warmly, they truly enjoy meeting travellers and you will be able to learn plenty about all their activities (black pearls, copra, fishing, vanilla cultivation, egg farming and more).</p>
<p>The NW anchorage about 1.5 nm from the NW pass is calm in NE winds but rolly in E winds and dangerous in S winds (because of the long fetch).</p>
<p>This is a straightforward lagoon to sail across pass to pass or even diagonally with few reefs easily avoided with good light. Keep an eye out for pearl farm buoys even in the middle of the lagoon.</p>
<p>If you are looking for somewhere unique to haul your boat, try <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Apataki/?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">Apataki Carenage</a> in the south of the Atoll. This is a boatyard for cruisers doing their own work, not for expert advice and services.</p>
