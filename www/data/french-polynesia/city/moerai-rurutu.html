<div class="hello"><div><p>Rurutu is the northernmost of the Austral islands and the village of Moerai lies on its NE side. The island is becoming well known for the number of whales which can be seen arround its shores. Most of the 2,000 inhabitants of the island are fishermen and farmers and its polynesian culture has remained largely unchanged.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Moerai is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p><span>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Moerai village</span> can deal with Immigration and Customs formalities.</p>
<p>For full details on clearance into and out of FP go to <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mataura/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/?rc=Formalities">French Polynesia Formalities</a></b>.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The island has a fringing coral reef very close to the shore. </p>
<p>Moerai has a small harbour and a quay where the supply ship berths.</p>
<p>There is no further information available about berthing or anchoring here, althouth there does appear to be a small quay on the western side of the island at Avera.</p>
