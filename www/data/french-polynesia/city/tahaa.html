<div class="hello"><div><p>Tahaa lies in the same barrier reef as Raiatea to the south. Tahaa is often called the Vanilla island due to those numerous plantations that flourish in the fertile valleys bordered by deepwater bays. You can navigate the channel encircling the island.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that <span style="text-align: justify; "> </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">Tahaa is investing heavily in making its bays more attractive to the cruiser. There are now mooring balls installed and book swaps etc.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A public dock (Quai de Tapuamu) at Uporu/Iripau is available for loading/unloading.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Mooring balls have also been installed on the west side of Tahaa, but not at the coral garden.  You still have to anchor SOUTH of the coral garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span>Haamene Bay on the east of Tahaa is the largest protected body of water on the island. It <span>cuts about 2 miles into the centre of the island, which makes it very still and peaceful. There is also a nice restaurant at the head of the bay which is also the best place to anchor for protection and scenery. Three mooring buoys have now been installed close to the town. <span style="text-align: justify; ">The new boardwalk is almost finished and the library (located behind the ice house) is happy to lend books to cruisers and accepts books as well.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><b>Caution: </b>As well as the public moorings, many local businesses have installed private moorings for the free use of any yacht that patronizes their activities. <span>Some are unsuitable for yachts and therefore it is important to check any mooring before leaving the yacht unattended! </span></p>
