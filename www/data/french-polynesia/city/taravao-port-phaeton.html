<div class="hello"><div><p>This land locked lagoon is on the South West coast of Tahiti <span>on the south side of the isthmus joining Tahiti Nui to Tahiti Iti. Approx. 50 km </span>from the capital Papeete this is a small, quiet town with a marina that accomodates approx. 20 boats. The town of Taravao is about a 10 minute walk from the top of the bay.</p>
<p><span>Port Phaeton provides excellent shelter for cyclone season, even better if your boat is the right size for haulout at Tahiti Nautic Center.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Pass Tapuaeraha is so wide it could accommodate a cruise ship. It's well marked with buoys and a range light. Follow the marks down the channel towards Port Phaeton. It narrows at Pt Riri where the channel markers are red marking the shore and green marking the reef. There is an abandoned yacht basin here.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In the upper reaches of Port Phaeton yachts can anchor in 24ft in sand and mud. The anchorage is surrounded by verdant hills and is well protected from all directions. Holding is good and conditions calm. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a small marina holding twenty boats, a dinghy dock, hot showers, a repair shop and a road behind where you can pick up a bus to Papeete. Note however that buses are all privately owned and do not run to a schedule.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a public park at the top of the bay with a dock. From here you can walk into the town of <strong>Taravao</strong> in about ten minutes. There are good markets in the town.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If leaving your boat here for cyclone season, note that <span>Taravao is the wettest spot in Tahiti with extremely high humidity. Prepare your boat accordingly before closing it up and leaving it.</span></span></span></p></div></div>
