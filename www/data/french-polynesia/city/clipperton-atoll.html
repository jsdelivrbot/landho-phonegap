<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This remote island has, for convenience, been included in French Polynesia, but since 2007 has been designated as an Overseas possession of France. </span></p>
<p><span>Clipperton is an uninhabited atoll, some 700 miles (1125 km) off the Mexican coast.</span></p>
<p><span>The lagoon of this atoll has no pass, but the few yachts which stop there can shelter in the lee of the reef. Landing through the surf is sometimes difficult but the diving on the surrounding reef makes up for it.</span></p>
<p><span>Position 10°18′N, 109°13′W.</span></p></div></div>
