<div class="hello"><div><p><strong><a class="external-link" href="../Tahiti">Papeete</a></strong> (Tahiti) is the Port of Entry for this island group.</p>
<p>If visiting Tahiti or Moorea (regardless of whether you have already cleared into FP elsewhere), it is compulsory to register with the Harbourmaster's office in Papeete. See <b><a class="external-link" href="../Tahiti">Papeete</a> </b>for full details of how to do this.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several passes to choose from through which to enter the lagoon encircling the island.</p>
<p>The two best anchorages, Cook's Bay and Opunohu Bay, are on the north side of this heart-shaped island and have spectacular entries. Cook's Bay can be entered at night as it has a directional light. Opunohu Bay is unlit. Both bays offer very good shelter.</p>
<p><strong>Security Note: With the fall in hotel trade on Moorea, cruisers have noticed a rise in crime here, in particular against boats anchored in Opunohu Bay. Be sure to secure your dinghy and outboard and raise both at night, as well as remove any loose items from the deck. It is advisable to leave someone on board if going ashore at night.</strong></p>
<p>On the east coast, Afareaitu, has only a very mediocre anchorage and very few yachts go there, preferring Vaiare, just 3 miles to the north. This has the only marina on the island and also a popular anchorage just north of it (the Sofitel Ia Ora hotel). Vaiare is also the terminal for the ferries to/from Papeete and closer to the airport.</p>
