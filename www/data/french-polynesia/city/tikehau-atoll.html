<div class="hello"><div><p><span>It is possible to tie up for a few hours to the municipal dock at the main village in an emergency or to load/unload something heavy. Contact the mairie first to make sure no cargo ship is using the dock.</span><br/><br/><span>Most vessels anchor in sand in various locations to the East of the dock in front of the many pensions that line the beaches. Some pensions have docks and with their permission you may anchor your dinghy nearby in such a way as to not obstruct the use of their docks.</span></p>
