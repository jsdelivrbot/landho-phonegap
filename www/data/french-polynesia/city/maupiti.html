<div class="hello"><div><p>A short and easy sail away from Bora Bora (26 nm away), Maupiti is called the paradise destination to discover.</p>
<p>This little island offers a well protected lagoon however entry into and out of the pass can only be achieved in settled weather, hence, fewer yachts venture here.</p>
<p>People here have been less touched by tourism and are very hospitable. The village of Vaiea is small and charming.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>A word of caution about the pass. It is well marked with 2 bearing ranges and several lateral markers. The best time to enter the pass is midday as the continual outgoing tidal current is at its lowest. Do not enter if swell is higher than 5 ft or if strong winds from the S-SE as the waves will make the pass too dangerous to negotiate.</p>
<p>Public dock available for loading/unloading. Check schedule of local freighters.</p>
<p>There are six mooring balls at Pte Tamaupiti (just west of the pass) and 3 more in town. The town<span> anchorage has good holding in sand (10-30ft) and is well protected. There is a dinghy dock here.</span></p>
