<div class="hello"><div><p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Tubuai can deal with Immigration and Customs formalities.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The main pass is well marked and presents no danger. </p>
<p>The anchorage in front of the townhouse (mentionned in cruising guides) is not the best anchorage. It is better to anchor in the protection of the small dock, about 1 mile away, even if you may have to move your boat a little to let the Tahiti ferry dock there.</p>
<p>There is also reported to be an anchorage on the southern side of the island.</p>
