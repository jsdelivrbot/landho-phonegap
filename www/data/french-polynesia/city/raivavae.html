<div class="hello"><div><p>Raivavae rates as one of the most beautiful islands and is certainly on a
par with Bora Bora as the mountainous island is similarly surrounded by a
coral reef. </p>
<p>The passage through the reef is clearly buoyed and leads to a
quay, where one can come alongside. As elsewhere in French Polynesia, passages through the lagoon are marked by beacons so it is easy to make one's way to the east of the main island to anchor off one of the many islets.</p>
<p>Position 23°52'S,147°44'W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Raivavae is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p><span>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Raivavae </span>can deal with Immigration and Customs formalities.</p>
<p>For full details on clearance into and out of FP go to <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Moerai/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mataura/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/?rc=Formalities">French Polynesia Formalities</a></b>.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is now an ATM <span>at Raivavae that accepts credit cards, maestro etc. <span> It is located outside the post office, 200m from the waterfront. </span></span></p>
<p>Boats arriving at Raivavae as their first port of call in French Polynesia would be well advised to obtain a supply of French Polynesian currency before leaving their previous port.</p>
<p>There is a small wharf off the village where a temporary stop for water is permitted.</p>
<p>The holding in the anchorage is good in 10m over mud.</p>
