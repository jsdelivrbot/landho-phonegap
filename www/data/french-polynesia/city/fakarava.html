<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the second biggest atoll of the Tuamotu archipelago. Fakarava is an interesting atoll to visit. </p>
<p>Scuba diving at both passes is excellent and the channel between the
passes is well marked so the very few coral heads are easily avoided. This atoll was classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. </p>
<p>Pass Garuae (north) is very wide and easy and is near the town of Rotaova.
Pass Tumakohua (25nm further south) is a little more tricky to negotiate but well marked.</p>
