<div class="hello"><div><p>This is the largest island and the capital of the Marquesas. Taiohae the capital is a popular spot for yachts to clear in as the harbour has a dock with several facilities, including a fresh market, provisions, fuel, gas, WiFi etc.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Taiohae</span> is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p>There are three Gendarmerie areas in the Marquesas: <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/HivaOa">Hiva Oa</a></strong>, <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Hakahau">Ua Pou</a></strong> and <strong>Nuku Hiva</strong>, and officially boats arriving from overseas should go to one of these islands first.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at t<span>he ports of entry in the other islands.</span></p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in <span>Taiohae</span> can deal with Customs and Immigration (<span>normally open here Monday to Friday </span><span>07:30-11:30</span><span>). </span><span>It </span><span>is opposite the Post Office, up the hill on the right. It is not far from the dock. Both skipper and crew must attend.</span></p>
<p>If required, the bond can be purchased at the Bank Socredo, a short walk along the waterfront road. Bank Socredo also has a branch in Bora Bora where the bond will be refunded upon departure.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can pay a fee and use the local agent, Yacht Service Nuku Hiva, see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/NukuHiva?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices">General Services</a></strong> for details.</p>
<p>For full details on clearance into and out of FP go to <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mangareva/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Raivavae/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Moerai/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mataura/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/?rc=Formalities">French Polynesia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>Customs patrol the islands and in particular Nuku Hiva, boarding as many yachts as possible. They have a list of yachts checked in and have scanned copies of their customs declaration. Officials are reported to be polite but checks could be anything from a quick look around to a very thorough opening of everything (even tapping for hidden compartments). It is important to declare properly what you have on board or you will be fined or have items confiscated. They are looking for arms, alcohol, strong medicine and pearls. Pearls without receipts are confiscated as they are trying to remove poor quality pearls from the market. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This island offers many protected anchorages.</p>
<p><strong>Taiohae Bay</strong><br/> This bay lies in the middle of the south coast. <span>The entrance is straightforward and may be possible to enter at night, using the red flashing range lights, when aligned they provide a good entry course.  Use caution if entering at night as there may be boats at anchor without anchor lights. The swell can be bad here and a stern anchor may help to face into the swell, but most boats swing freely.</span></p>
<p><span>The large quay is easily visible to Starboard when entering in all conditions.  The area between the large quay and small municiple quay, at the end of the bay in the NE corner, is a NO MOORING zone.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Extreme care</i></b> must be taken at the municipal quay (dinghy dock) particularly when there is swell in the bay. At low water dinghies can end up under the wall and several cases of damaged dinghies has occurred particularly near the short ladders which you climb to exit your dinghy. It is better to exit your dinghy at the ladders and then move the dinghy to the southern wall by the large tyres. Do not leave the dinghy further north near the local fishing boats, as dinghies have been rolled here too.</p>
<p>Fuel is available here and there is a bank (see services adjacent for more details). <span>Water from the municipal faucets is not suitable for drinking. </span></p>
<p><strong>Baie du Controlleur</strong><br/> This is a three fingered bay. Anchor in the middle one. It is reported to be less rolly than in Taiohae Bay. You can get drinking water here at the shed at Taipevai, or just beyond the shed at Hooumi. There are 3 shops at Taipevai (see services adjacent for more details).</p>
