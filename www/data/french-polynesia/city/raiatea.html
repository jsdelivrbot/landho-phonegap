<div class="hello"><div><p>Raiatea lies about 130 miles NW of Tahiti (or 25 miles from Huahine or Bora Bora) and is the second of the Society Islands in geographic size, population, available supplies and marine services.</p>
<p><span>It has rugged mountains, deep water bays and a myriad of anchorages protected by a barrier reef. Nearly every part of the coastline is accessible by boat, which makes Raiatea interesting if avoiding rough weather by cruising to the off-wind opposite side of the island. </span></p>
<p><span>The town of Uturoa serves as the administrative center for the Leeward Islands. It has modern dock facilities and is a good place to work on the boat, to leave your boat for a while and to provision before your departure for the Cook Islands. </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Uturoa is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands (Marquesas, Tuamotus, Gambiers, Australs etc.) and complete all customs and immigration formalities in the one place.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Uturoa can deal with Immigration and Customs.<span> </span><span>Their office is close to the Post Office on the NW side of the town directly on the main street.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Note that the leading marks and main marks between the pass and the port are lit.</p>
<p>There are three public Marinas in Raiatea: Two in Uturoa and one in Apooiti. <span>There are also mooring buoys that are for public use, some paid, others not.  These are mostly useful in the dry season ,April to November.</span></p>
<p><strong>Uturoa’s main marina/public dock<br/></strong></p>
<p>This is mainly for the local fishermen, loading/unloading, ferries and access for big cruise ships and is located in the centre of town.</p>
<p>It is divided into two areas: a well-protected part for fishing boats and ferries; and a very exposed part for visitors. Sailboats are only allowed to dock in the latter part. There is no power supply or water connection.</p>
<p>Wash from the fast fishing boats and ferries are sometimes a hazard if staying on the dock here, as well as strong easterly winds. Keep in mind, there are some steel rings directly attached to the pier’s concrete wall. The nearby Shell Gas Station does not offer water for visitors.</p>
<p><strong><i>Security:</i></strong> There is no security and there continues to be incidents of thefts from boats here (both unlocked and locked) - see reports adjacent. It is recommended not to overnight on this dock, however if it cannot be avoided be sure to secure everything on deck as well as the dinghy engine(s) and the dinghy itself, and remove anything of value from view. It goes without saying that you should lock the boat up at night and when going ashore.</p>
<p><strong>Uturoa marina north<br/></strong>This is the home base of Dream Yacht Charters and is usually overcrowded with permanent residents. However, there are two moorings in front of the marina entrance which can be used if free and by liaising with Dream Yacht Charters.</p>
<p><strong><i>Advance reservations for any of the Marinas are only possible for permanent residents.</i></strong></p>
<p>There is a small marina at the boatyard Chantier Naval, but only for their customers waiting to get pulled out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong><br/> There are a number of, safe, secluded anchorages around the island. Baie Haamene on the west coast offers a secure holding in mud. <span>In front of the northern Uturoa marina (Dream Yacht Charters) is a good and not too deep spot for a sandy anchorage. </span><span>There are numerous places before the reef on the west and east side of Raiatea for anchoring depending on the wind direction. It is recommended to get the exact spot information from locals or a good map. <span style="text-align: justify; ">Faaroa Bay is a popular destination and there are now 3 mooring balls mid-channel (in front of the restaurant) and 3 more and a dinghy dock at the bottom of the bay.</span><span style="text-align: justify; "> </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">Anchoring in mud is possible too.</span></span></p>
