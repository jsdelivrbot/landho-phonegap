<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two passes into the lagoon; one at the north end and the other on the eastern side, by the village (<span>Pouheva</span>). Both are narrow and it is advisable to wait for slack water before attempting them. There are any coral heads in the lagoon, so finding a suitable anchorage is not easy.</p>
<p>There is a wharf at the village and it it might be possible to moor there if no supply vessels are due.</p>
<p>The village has a <span>post office, French bakery and a supermarket</span>. If the supply ship has just called, then it will be possible to buy fresh fruit and veg. The atoll also has an airstrip.</p>
<p>It is possible to get a WiFi signal here but it is slow and, sometimes, intermittent.</p>
<p>The people here are helpful and friendly.</p>
