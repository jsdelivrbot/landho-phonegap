<div class="hello"><div><p>The Port of Entry is <span>Hakahau</span>.</p>
<p>There are three Gendarmerie areas in the Marquesas: <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/HivaOa">Hiva Oa</a></strong>, <strong>Ua Pou</strong> and <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/NukuHiva">Nuku Hiva</a></strong>, and officially boats arriving from overseas should go to one of these islands first.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p>The Gendarm<span>erie Nationale in Hakahau can deal with Customs and Immigration (</span><span>open Monday to Friday </span><span>0730-1200 &amp; 1400-1730</span><span>).</span></p>
<p>For full details on clearance into and out of FP go to <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/NukuHiva/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mangareva/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Raivavae/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Moerai/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Mataura/Countries/FrenchPolynesia/?rc=Formalities">French Polynesia Formalities</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>If you have fruits or vegetables from other islands, they may not be landed, as Ua Pou does not have the fruit fly, as does Nuku Hiva. However cruisers reported in 2014 that no one was aware of this rule and no one asked.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Hakahau Harbour: </b></p>
<p><b></b>Anchorage is available behind a breakwater in 20 feet of good sand for 5 or 6 boats, or else anchor out in the bay (less protected with some swell). The bay is small and yachts use bow and stern anchors so more can fit in and face into the swell.</p>
<p>The dock has water faucets and a dinghy landing, with an easy walk to the village. Alternatively land at the beach closer to the village.</p>
<p>If space is available, boats may come alongside the quay temporarily, when local freighters do not use it.</p>
<p><i>Yacht Adina who visited here in 2014 have a good article on their website about <b><a class="external-link" href="http://yachtadina.co.uk/?page_id=1239">Using a Stern Anchor</a>.</b></i></p>
