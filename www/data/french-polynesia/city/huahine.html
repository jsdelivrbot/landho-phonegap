<div class="hello"><div><p>Huahine lies 110 miles NW of Tahiti (or 70 miles from Moorea). Visible from Raiatea, Tahaa and Bora Bora, the two islands of Huahine Nui and Huahine Iti are connected by a bridge and have a combined area of 28 sq.miles.</p>
<p>The road winds 20 miles around the two islands, passing through small villages surrounded by banana, breadfruit, papaya and mango trees. All around both islands are plantations of vanilla, coffee, taro, watermelons and cantaloupe. There are few cars here, so it is perfect to explore on a bicycle. There are many secluded coves and uninhabited islets to visit.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Fare is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands (Marquesas, Tuamotus, Gambiers, Australs etc.) and complete all customs and immigration formalities in the one place.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Fare can deal with Immigration and Customs.</p>
<p>Full details can be found at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia?rc=Formalities#Clearance">French Polynesia Clearance</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is no marina but a public dock in Fare is available for loading/unloading.</p>
<p>Space for anchoring off the village is limited, but there are many attractive anchorages on both west and east coasts of the island.</p>
<p>There are several reports posted adjacent with recommended anchorages.</p>
<p><span>Motu Murhimahora on the east side of Huahine comes recommended by cruisers as a good anchoring spot. Entry is via Passe Farerea. A local called Paul, whose property fronts onto the beach here, is an incredibly warm and friendly person and will undoubtedly speak with you, not wanting anything other than friendship. </span></p>
