<div class="hello"><div><p>Bora Bora lies about 160 miles NW of Tahiti (or 26 miles from Raiatea or Maupiti). Bora Bora is called the most beautiful island of the Pacific. Protected by a circling barrier reef, its lagoon offers a myriad of nice anchorages. Only one pass leads to Vaitape, the main village.</p>
<p>Sadly, the intense development on Bora Bora for tourists has meant that she has lost much of her Polynesian charm, particularly under the water.</p>
<p>Position 16°30'S,151°46'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Vaitape is a Port of Entry.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands (Marquesas, Tuamotus, Gambiers, Australs etc.) and complete all customs and immigration formalities in the one place.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Vaitape can deal with Immigration and Customs.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Clearing out of French Polynesia is much easier here than in Papeete as the Gendarmerie is </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">immigration, port and customs, all rolled into one, which saves alot of running around. Once clearance has been granted you have 24 hours to leave, compared to "before midnight" in Papeete. </span><span style="text-align: justify; ">The gendarmerie is open 7 days a week.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Enter the pass at 113.4°, after the second marker, take a course of 70° towards the baie of Faanui. The Boa Bora Yacht Club is just inside the only channel entering the lagoon.</p>
<p>Although the anchorage is deep (85') in the area around the rebuilt Boa Bora Yacht Club, the holding is good. There are also mooring buoys, but it is dubious as to how well they are maintained. The anchorage  and mooring field here is well protected from prevailing winds from the East and South.</p>
<p>There are also moorings at the newer MaiKai Marina, around the corner, closer to Viatape  and near the fuel dock - just pick one up that is free. A floating dock, for loading/unloading, a fixed dock and floating docks for dinghies are available here. <span>Anchoring here is not recommended, it is 30+ metres deep with lots of coral at the bottom, and nasty gusts constantly rush down the mountain, tossing boats around. </span></p>
<p>A public dock is available for loading/unloading at downtown Vaitape. Another popular mooring stop is in front of Bloody Mary's Restaurant.</p>
<p>In the past, anchorages on the east coast of Bora Bora were restricted for lagoon and ecological reasons. However, now there are no such restrictions, and yachts are free to sail and anchor on the east side of the the island.</p>
<p>It is now not allowed to anchor further than 1 NM east of Bora Bora airport. Also due to a drastic drop in Manta Ray population recently, all cruising yachts are requested not to attempt to snorkel in the area. All access to this area is restricted.</p>
<p><b>Security:</b> <span>There has been a rash of dinghy/motor thefts in 2015, not only in Bora Bora but also Huahine and Raiatea. Be sure to lift it and lock it.</span></p>
