<div class="hello"><div><p>Mangareva is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p><span>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Mangareva </span><span>can deal with Immigration and Customs formalities.</span></p>
<p><span>To reach the Gendarmerie, head south west from the dock. Their office is clearly marked and on the way into town, just past the Municipal Building. You will find the officers polite, friendly and easy to deal with.</span></p>
