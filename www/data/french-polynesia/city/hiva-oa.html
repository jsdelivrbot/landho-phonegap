<div class="hello"><div><p>Atuona is the Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>This is the most common port of entry for boats arriving from the east. No other islands (other than the ports of entry </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/Hakahau">Ua Pou</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/NukuHiva">Nuku Hiva</a></strong><span>) should be  visited before reporting to the officials in Atuona. </span><i>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/FatuHiva">Fatu Hiva</a></strong> for reports from cruisers there in 2014.</i></p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Atuona can deal with Immigration and Customs formalities.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie in Atuona is located half-a-mile (1 km) uphill. It is reported that the Gendarme may only process yachts during morning hours (until approx. 1100) on working days. They are reported to be friendly and efficient.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The small port of Atuona provides good shelter, but can get crowded due to the number of boats checking in and a swell can arise. Boats deploy stern anchors to not only face into the swell, but also to allow more yachts to squeeze in. It is highly recommended you prepare your stern anchor ready to launch in advance, as winds commonly flow into the bay from the north while boats point into the swell from the south.</p>
<p>Yachts should also anchor behind two yellow posts with crosses on land on the starboard side as you enter the harbour (not easily detected). This is to keep yachts clear of the passage supply vessels which enter the harbour.</p>
<p>The depth varies from 2 to 3.5 metres so deep drafted boats may have to anchor outside the breakwater.</p>
<p>If a large southerly swell is predicted, boats at the end of the bay may find themselves in breaking waves.</p>
<p><i>Yacht Adina who visited French Polynesia in 2014 has written a useful article on stern anchoring - go to </i><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.yachtadina.co.uk/sailingnotes"><i>www.yachtadina.co.uk</i><i>/sailingnotes</i></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong><br/>The dinghy can be left at the steps by the main quay (it is best to lift the dinghy onto the quay as there is a lot of surge) or by the ramp in the SE corner of the harbor. The ramp is extremely slippery so it is best to try to land at high water.</p>
<p><strong>Shore Facilities</strong><br/>There is a public telephone in the harbour but other facilities are limited. At the dinghy dock is a tourist information hut run by Sandra from 8am to 11am for the benefit of yachts. She can arrange for laundry to be cleaned, tours to Puamau to see the tikis, airport taxis etc.  Sandra will organise fresh produce if you request it. She offers internet access for 24 hours for 2000 CFP. The fuel station within walking distance also has some limited supplies including fresh baguettes in the morning. There are some outdoor showers and a place for doing hand washing.</p>
<p><strong>Yacht Services</strong><br/>There is a new haulout facility here with boatyard. Facilities are basic, however it is worth considering for cyclone season and repairs are possible. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/FrenchPolynesia/HivaOa?rc=RepairFacilities#Boatyards">Boatyards</a></strong> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The time zone here is -9.5 UTC.</p>
