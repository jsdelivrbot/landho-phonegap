<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Avatoru is the Port of Entry.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process.</strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands (Marquesas, Tuamotus, Gambiers, Australs etc.) and complete all customs and immigration formalities in the one place.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie Nationale in Avatoru can deal with Immigration <span>and Customs.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts anchor off Tiputa village, or the more sheltered anchorage off the Kia Ora Village Hotel. It is possible to tie up for a few hours to the municipal dock in Avatoru pass in an emergency or to load/unload something heavy. Contact the mairie first to make sure no cargo is using the dock. </p>
<p>There is a small harbor on the west side inside of Tiputa pass. </p>
<p>A possible anchorage and dinghy harbor is just in front of the airport, easy to pick up guests.</p>
