            </h2>
<div><p><strong><strong>It </strong>is NO LONGER compulsory for all yachts visiting French Polynesia to visit Papeete Customs and Immigration to complete the clearing-in process. </strong></p>
<p>Yachts can now clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) at the ports of entry in the other islands (Marquesas, Tuamotus, Gambiers, Australs etc.) and complete all customs and immigration formalities in the one place (full details below).</p>
<p>Be sure to also visit the local "gendarmes" office at the various islands you visit throughout French Polynesia once cleared in.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Arrival clearance in </strong><a href="Tahiti">Papeete</a><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If visiting Tahiti or Moorea (regardless of whether you have already cleared into FP elsewhere), it is compulsory to register with the Harbourmaster's office on arrival - known as the Entrance Declaration. If this Entrance Declaration is not carried out then Clearance will not be granted.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><i>Regist</i></span><span><i>ering with Papeete Harbourmaster</i><br/></span></strong><span>Skippers do not need to visit the Harbourmaster in person. Registration can be done by e-mail. </span><strong>Document F09.01 (Avis d’Opération Nautique Petite Plaisance)</strong><span> MUST be filled out properly and sent to:</span></p>
<p><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:trafficmaritime@portppt.pf"><strong>trafficmaritime@portppt.pf </strong></a><br/>Copy to <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:sp@portppt.pf">sp@portppt.pf</a> and <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:marinadepapeete@portppt.pf">marinadepapeete@portppt.pf</a></p>
<p>If you are a Papeete Marina customer, this document will be sent to you by the Marina agents.</p>
<p><span><strong><i>If Arrriving from a Foreign Country</i></strong><br/>The owner or master of the boat must go to the Immigration office located at Faaa Airport. </span><span>If someone is embarking or disembarking, they must also visit Immigration on arrival in Tahiti.</span></p>
<p><span> Next, skippers must visit the Customs office in Motu Uta (20 min walk or taxi ride).</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Arrival clearance in other FP Islands:<br/></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Because of the distances and sailing conditions, FP Customs now authorise yachts to report inwards and outwards from islands where there is a “gendarmerie”. As stated above, a visit to Papeete to complete clearance is no longer necessary.</span></p>
<p>Immigration formalities will be processed by the Gendarmes.</p>
<p>They will also provide the<strong> </strong>owner or master<strong> </strong>of the boat with a “Customs declaration form” that shall be filled in and signed. The gendarmes will then scan and email the form to the Customs main office in Papeete. It is then the responsibility of the skipper to post the form to Papeete not later than 24 hours after arrival on the outer island (keep one copy with you). Remember that the gendarmes are not Customs officials and in fact often know very little about the latest Customs regulations.</p>
<p><span>The Customs declaration form should be taken seriously as a French customs boat patrols the islands and regularly inspects boats using the information sent to Papeete. They are particularly interested in any arms, alcohol, strong medicine and whether you have bought any pearls and will confiscate anything not declared.</span></p>
<p><span><i><strong>Note: </strong>A visit to Customs in <span>Motu Uta, </span>Papeete will be necessary if you have not mailed your white customs sheet from the first port of entry in French Polynesia.</i></span></p>
<p><span>After completing clearance in the outer islands, yachts are no longer obliged to continue flying the Q flag.</span></p>
<p><span>Each clearance port for the outer islands has details of how to find its respective Gendarmes office.</span></p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/Douanes/Section-Particuliers/A-Importation/Navigation-de-plaisance"><strong>here</strong></a> for the official Customs website (only in French). From this site, the Customs declaration form can be downloaded and this form is in both French and English.</p>
<p><strong>Departure Clearance in <a href="Tahiti">Papeete</a><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p>For all departures for more than 50nm away from Tahiti and/or Moorea, yachts must make a clearance request.</p>
<p><strong>In all cases,</strong> e-mail the Papeete Harbourmaster 3 days (72 hours) prior to departure from Tahiti and/or Moorea. E-mail <span><strong><a class="mail-link" href="mailto:trafficmaritime@portppt.pf">trafficmaritime@portppt.pf</a></strong> and copy to <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:sp@portppt.pf">sp@portppt.pf</a> and <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:marinadepapeete@portppt.pf">marinadepapeete@portppt.pf</a></span></p>
<p><span>Include details of your boat name, captain's name, date of departure and destination (for example Cook Islands via the Leeward Islands or Tonga).</span></p>
<p><span>If you are planning on just cruising the Polynesian Islands and then returning to Tahiti/Moorea, sending the e-mail is all you need to do. You will receive your clearance by e-mail and when you return to Tahiti/Moorea you simply need to e-mail the Harbourmaster with your date of return and place of mooring. No Customs Declaration is needed in this case.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you plan to depart Tahiti and sail to a foreign country via other FP Islands:</strong></p>
<p>The Harbourmaster will prepare your inner Polynesian Islands departure clearance in Tahiti and e-mail it to you. You must however go and meet the Gendarmes in the last FP island touched to do the official final exit from FP.</p>
<p><span>You will have to fill out a Custom Exit Declaration document, signed by the G</span><span>endarme agent. Before leaving the country, this document must be sent (regular mail) to: </span></p>
<p><i>Bureau de douanes de PPT Port (service Plaisance)<br/>Direction des douanes de Polynésie française<br/>BP 9006 PPT - Motu Uta</i></p>
<p>The local Gendarme will give you 24 hours to leave once clearance has been granted.</p>
<p><strong>If you plan to depart Tahiti and sail direct to a foreign country:</strong></p>
<p>It is compulsory to go and meet Customs at their main office in <span>Motu Uta, Papeete, to make your Exit Declaration the day before departure. </span><span>The harbourmaster will send your clearance to the Immmigration authorities and a copy to the Customs office. </span></p>
<p><span>The day of departure the Skipper must visit Immigration at the airport to pick up the exit clearance. This gives yachts until midnight to depart. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Duty Free Fuel can be obtained by visiting Customs in Papeete who will issue you with a duty-free fuel certificate. This can be obtained anytime during your stay in FP.</span></li>
<li><span>If you have to pay a bond on entry (non EU citizens only), ensure that your papers specify which island you  will be departing from in order that arrangements can be made to retrieve your  bond. For more information about paying the bond (and possible ways to get around it) see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Immigration">Immigration</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong></strong><strong> </strong><span>below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><br/><strong>Departure Clearance from other FP Islands</strong></span></p>
<p>Visit the Gendarmes at the clearance port you are departing from at least a day before departure and complete <span>a Customs Exit Declaration document, signed by the G</span><span>endarme agent. Before leaving the country, this document must be sent (regular mail) to:</span></p>
<p><i>Bureau de douanes de PPT Port (service Plaisance)<br/>Direction des douanes de Polynésie française<br/>BP 9006 PPT - Motu Uta</i></p>
<p><span>Sometimes the Gendarmes will do this on your behalf, however it is your responsibility to ensure the form gets mailed to Papeete. The Gendarmes will also stamp your passports. They will then give you 24 hours to depart.</span></p>

            </h2>
<div><p>All visitors need a passport valid for at least 6 months (except French nationals).</p>
<p>French Polynesia is part of the European Union (as an overseas collective of France) <strong>but not</strong> of the Schengen Area Agreement and has its own visa rules. These rules closely follow those of mainland France with some exceptions that are specific to FP.</p>
<p><span>As not all border crossings are </span><span>sufficiently manned</span><span>, it is advisable for yacht crews to make every effort to obtain a passport stamp to be able to prove their length of stay to avoid difficulties at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>EU Citizens</strong></span></p>
<p>Length of stay for EU citizens is regulated by FP decree N°2010-1434 dated 19 November 2010. They do not require a visa for a stay of less than 3 months.</p>
<p>For stays longer than 3 months, EU citizens require sufficient income for their stay in FP (proof of funds might be requested) and also medical insurance covering them and the members of their family during their stay in FP.</p>
<p><span>Citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Norway may have a special agreement with French Polynesia and should check with immigration authorities about permitted length of stay without a visa.</span></p>
<p>EU Citizens are permitted to stay in FP up to 18 months.  This is the maximum <i><span>accumulated</span></i> time they may spend in FP, without being subjected to taxes and duties on the boat: i.e. they may fly out of FP then back in again, but <i><span>that will neither reset the clock nor put it on hold</span></i>.</p>
<p><strong>How long can I stay in FP with my Boat? </strong><span>See </span><a href="?rc=Formalities#Customs"><strong>Customs</strong></a><span> section below for more details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Non-EU Citizens</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Non-EU Citizens are only permitted to stay for the length of their visa. This is usually a maximum of 3 months in any 6 month period.</p>
<p><strong>Long Stay Visas (LS)</strong></p>
<p>Non-EU citizens wishing to stay longer than 3 months must obtain a LS visa. This is done by contacting a French consulate (up to 5 months) BEFORE arriving in French Polynesia in order to get a long stay visa in your passport.</p>
<p>On arrival in French Polynesia you must apply for a<strong> "Carte de Sejour"</strong> (temporary resident card). This can be done through the Haut Commissaire in Nuku Hiva or Papeete. The procedure is straightforward to do and can be done without the use of an agent (although you may wish to pay an agent to do this on your behalf). See <strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents.</a></strong></p>
<p>Reasons will have to be provided as to why you wish to stay longer, as well as having to give an idea of what you plan to do during your stay, submit proofs of financial independence, etc. The consulate will transmit your demand to the High Commissioner in Papeete.</p>
<p>This procedure is lengthy (on average 7 weeks), but legitimate requests are often granted. If submitting papers from the Marquesas, you will not be permitted to leave the Marquesas until your paperwork is returned from Papeete.</p>
<p><strong><i>In 2016 a new ruling came into effect that requires LS visa applicants to appear in person at the Haut Commissaire’s office to submit and receive the carte sejour. That would eliminate any help the agent could give you and require you to proceed to Nuka Hiva as they have an HC office in Taiohae.</i></strong></p>
<p>It is<b> important to note</b> that your health insurance must cover the whole period of your LS visa, otherwise your visa will expire at the same time as your health insurance.</p>
<p>Avoiding using the local postal service may speed things up (i.e. using overnight air carrier). <span>This updated report by</span><strong><a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/66f31e_a79cf3c5e29744e2874a16dbb2e17a1e.pdf"> SV Jacaranda</a></strong><span> has some useful suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that early in the year, and through springtime, more people are applying and therefore the officials in Papeete have more applications to process, and will do them on a more regular basis. Applications outside this period may take a lot longer to process (some cruisers report 13 weeks).</span></p>
<p>See this file from <a href="http://svsoggypaws.com/files/TheMarquesasCompendium%20vG.3.pdf"><strong>SV Soggy Paws</strong></a> for more useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Funds / Bond for non-EU Citizens:</strong></p>
<p>All non EU citizens are required to do <strong><i>one</i></strong> of three things when they arrive in FP: <br/>1) Post a bond for each non-EU Passport of approx US$1,700 (yes this is required, even though you have had to prove funds when applying for the visa);<br/>or<br/>2) Have an airline ticket departing FP* (*see note below);<br/>or <br/>3) Have a Bond Exemption Letter from a registered Yacht Agent in FP, approximate <span>cost US$2-300 per </span><span>person. Note, in order to get bond exemption <span>you must have insurance which covers the cost of you flying out in case of a medical emergency.</span></span></p>
<p>Once the "Carte de Sejour" has been obtained, the bond/bond letter is no longer required.</p>
<p><span>The rules about having a return air ticket or posting a bond seem to be quite stricly enforced now, whereas in the past they were fairly relaxed, so do be prepared. Latest reports are that a bond letter is required whilst waiting for the "Carte de Sejour" - your agent can assist with this. Some cruisers in Nuka Hiva reported in 2015 that whilst a wait of 2 weeks was required for the visa, no bond or bond letter was required as long as the boat and crew remained in harbour. A rather "fluid" rule it seems.</span></p>
<p>* Refundable air tickets appear to be available through Air NZ. Refunds take approx. 2-3 weeks to process. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="clearing-into-french-polynesia-dealing-with-the-bond-duty-free-fuel/">this report</a></strong> by an Australian cruiser who used this option to circumvent paying the bond in April 2016.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Even if a bond is paid, if plans change you may encounter difficulties. See </span><a href="../../Members/val/R2012-08-04-1/"><strong>this report</strong></a><span> for more details.</span></p>
<p><span>For a list of yacht agents see </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Clearance Agents</a></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>The bond/bond letter is <strong>not required</strong> by EU citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Crew arriving by Air</strong></p>
<p><span>Crew arriving by air to join a boat should make this clear on their visa application, also to Immigration on arrival at the airport, who should give them both an entrance and an exit stamp in their passport. The exit stamp is needed to clear out by boat.</span></p>

<p><strong>Conditions of temporary entry of leisure vessels (admission temporaire des navires de plaisance) under decree</strong><strong> N°0401/CM dated 27 March 2013 and modified 22nd April 2014.</strong></p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/Douanes/Section-Particuliers/A-Importation/Navigation-de-plaisance"><strong>Customs website</strong></a> for all the details.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The length of time a private yacht can now remain has been extended to 36 months. Nor is it necessary to remain out of the country for 6 months before returning.</strong></p>
<p>Visiting leisure vessels can enter and be kept temporarily in French Polynesia without payment of Customs taxes and duties, during a maximum period of 36 months (there is no extension, except in cases of “force majeure”) provided:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vessel's inward clearance has been duly reported to the Customs office in Papeete.</li>
<li>The vessel      is registered (flagged) outside the territory of French Polynesia, and the      owner or master or user is a <i>bona      fide</i> tourist and not a resident in French Polynesia.</li>
<li>The vessel is      solely for the private use of the owner, or master, or user. Spouse or      direct ascendants or descendants of the owner, or master, or user are      allowed to privately use the vessel. </li>
<li>The vessel      shall not be used for commercial activities. It shall not be loaned,      rented or sold.</li>
<li>The owner      or master or user of the vessel shall not engage in lucrative activities      in French Polynesia.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The temporary admission status of a leisure vessel ends when it departs French Polynesia for a foreign port. There is now no minimum time it before it can return as long as it has visited a foreign port.</span></p>
<p><strong>Breaking the Rules</strong></p>
<p>If the permitted stay rules are broken, not only is a substantial fine imposed, but import taxes on the yacht also become due (understood to be about 25% of its value for French-flagged yachts and up to 35% for other foreign-flagged yachts).</p>
<p><strong>Overstaying</strong> <strong>the boat</strong> is considered a criminal offence and skippers that do so are liable to have their boat confiscated, be fined two times the boat's value and be given a jail term of 11 days to 1 month.</p>
<p>Customs have made it clear that the law will be fully enforced.</p>
<p><strong>You must declare:</strong></p>
<p>It is not specified on the Customs declaration form, but you must declare all motorized vehicles present on your boat: this includes dinghies with outboards for most leisure vessels, but also motorcycles and even helicopters for some larger yachts!</p>
<p>The make, model, motor output, and serial numbers of each vehicle and outboard shall be listed either directly on the Customs declaration form, or on a separate sheet to be attached to the Customs declaration from.</p>
<p>These vehicles will be granted the same temporary admission status as your boat, i.e. with the same rules and obligations.</p>
<p>Firearms and ammunition must be declared. If staying less than three days they  can be kept on board, otherwise must be bonded by the authorities in each island  until departure.</p>
<p><strong>All alcohol</strong> must be declared. <span>When reporting alcohol to the Gendarmes on arrival, be accurate. Do not under report stores or Customs will assume your intention is to sell the excess alcohol to the local population. You will be fined, and have alcohol confiscated. Note that there is no maximum that one can bring into the country, </span>but it is essential that the full amount <strong>in litres</strong> be correctly stated (not cases or bottles). Customs take this very seriously.</p>
<p><span>Tobacco products must also be declared</span></p>
<p><span>All prescription medicines must be in the original packaging with the patient's name. </span></p>
<p><span>The import of plants and grains is forbidden. Recently, the transport of fruits  between the islands in the Marquesas has begun to be controlled as they have  started to have problems with some fruit flies. Check with the local agriculture  inspection when landing. Yachts coming from the western Pacific, such as Fiji,  Tonga or the Cooks, may have to be fumigated. On arrival they should anchor off  and clear formalities before tying to the quay.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Customs Patrols</strong><br/><span>Customs patrol the islands, boarding as many yachts as possible. They have a list of yachts checked in and have scanned copies of their customs declaration. Officials are reported to be polite, but checks could be anything from a quick look around to a very thorough opening of everything (even tapping for hidden compartments). It is important to declare properly what you have on board (see list above) or you will be fined or have items confiscated. They are looking for arms, alcohol, strong medicine and pearls. Pearls without receipts are confiscated as Customs are trying to remove poor quality pearls from the market. </span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Duty Free Fuel<br/></strong><span>A permit for duty-free fuel can be obtained for free if you go in person to the Customs office in Papeete. Otherwise, if using an agent, you will be charged for this service.</span></p>
<p><strong>Duty Free Alcohol</strong><br/><span>You can only get this if you are leaving French Polynesia. So you can not get it if you are going on to anywhere else in FP. The alcohol is delivered to your boat on the date of departure.</span></p>
<p><strong>Bringing in spare parts/equipment (updated September 2013):</strong></p>
<p>Spare parts and equipment required to repair a vessel under the temporary admission status (“admission temporaire”), may be imported and cleared through customs without paying customs dues.</p>
<p>However, since mid-July 2013, these goods must also be declared for export when you check out of French Polynesia</p>
<p>Yachts owners/skippers can import/export goods by themselves, however there is alot of paperwork involved and the process can be "tricky". Assistance of a yacht agent can be very helpful (which also includes extra services like collecting the shipment at the port/airport and arranging final delivery to the yacht). <span>If the total of the shipment is over 350 Euros you are now required to have an agent under the new law.</span></p>
<p>Fees involved for bringing in spare parts are those charged by the Customs broker (for the 2 Customs declarations / paperwork for "temporary admission" and then "final exportation) and NOT for Customs duties. These fees depend on the shipment's CIF value (goods value + insurance+ freight). On average, fees invoiced by the Customs broker for each declaration are between 10 and 25.000 Cfp depending on the CIF value (1 Euros = 119,33 Cfp, 1 Usd is currently approx. 87 Cfp).</p>
<p><span>DHL can be both your shipper and your agent.</span></p>
<p><i><strong>Note</strong> that all other goods which are imported and not for repairs (for example tv, computer, crew clothing, etc.) must be cleared through Customs and DUTIES must be paid.</i></p>

<div><p><strong>Chikungunya Notice March 2015</strong><br/>Agents from Tahiti warn cruisers that during the winter rainy season, many French Polynesians (especially in the Marquesas) have become sick with <strong>Chikungunya</strong>, a tropical disease spread by mosquitos. By the time the majority of cruising boats arrive, in the dry season, it is hoped it will not be much of a problem. The only prevention is the application of liberal amounts of insect repellent with DEET.</p>
<p>Articles on Chikungunya can be found on the <strong><a class="external-link" href="../../General/MedicalSafety">Noonsite Medical and Safety</a></strong> page.</p>
<p>French Polynesia is very well covered by health care with hospitals and many doctors, specialists and dentists in the most populated islands, infirmeries with qualified nurses in even remotely populated areas. Emergency air transportation is in place if necessary. Many cruisers have been well taken care off so one should not hesitate to contact medical help if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Staphilococcus infections</strong> are prevalent and usually start from a small cut. The cuts should be cleaned out well, covered with an antibiotic cream and treated until healed, which can take as long as two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Filariosis</strong> (elephantiasis) is still known to exist in some islands. There is a preventative medicine, which gives protection for a year (only necessary if you stay over 6 months).</p>
<p>Outbreaks of <strong>Dengue Fever</strong> do occur here. Dengue Fever is a mosquito transmitted disease resulting in flu-like symptoms (high fevers, body aches, joint pain, headaches, dehydration). The only prevention is the application of liberal amounts of insect repellent with DEET. See report on latest outbreak at the<strong><a class="external-link" href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/zika-fever-french-polynesia-tahiti"> Centre for Disease Control &amp; Prevention</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span>The municipal water supply in the Marqueses is not potable.</span></p>
<p><span>The dangers of <strong>Ciguatera </strong>(fish toxin from eating reef fish) are not widely reported in French Polynesia, but it is a real danger and many locals are affected as well as visitors. Very useful information can be found in this article on the <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/66f31e_4a1b5b649dfe441b84508ad193c9c482.pdf"><strong>website of SV Jacaranda</strong></a>. </span></p></div>

            </h2>
<div><p>Charter: Visiting yachts may not charter in French Polynesia. That will break the rule of temporary admission of the boat (see CUSTOMS above).</p>
<p>People arriving by air to charter a boat need only a valid passport, return air ticket and a visa where applicable.</p>
<p>The approaches to the atolls of Mururoa, and Fangataufa and the area around them are prohibited areas, classed as military zones.</p>
<p>The movement of yachts is restricted in certain lagoons in the Tuamotus where there are pearl farms. Generally, one should avoid anchoring near oyster beds.</p>
<p>Alcohol consumption is a problem in many of the islands and visiting boats are urged not to dispense drinks freely to locals.</p>
<p>All fruit trees, including coconut trees, are privately owned. Fruit must not be taken without prior permission. Similarly, reefs inside lagoons are owned by families, so fishing should only be done after having asked permission to do so. Often, if asked, they give freely or gladly in exchange for goods or services.</p></div>
