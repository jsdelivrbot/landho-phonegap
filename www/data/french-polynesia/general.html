<div><p>French Pacific Franc (CFP for its French acronym, or XPF for its ISO acronym) with a fixed parity to the Euro (1 € = 119,33 XPF).</p>
<p>There are ATMs in most of the local post offices (there are post offices in all towns and little villages, even on outer islands), and at local banks in some islands. (e.g. the larger islands of the Marquesas at Taiohae, Nuka Hiva and Atuona on Hiva Oa, or Rangiroa in Tuamotu.)</p>
<p>Note: There is no ATM or bank in the Gambiers, but the post office will change US$.</p>
<p><span>Credit cards are accepted at many stores. </span></p>
<p>In some places you can exchange Euros or US Dollars at the local post office (E.g. in the Gambier at Rikitea, or in the Marquesas at Taiohae on Nuka Hiva and at Atuona on Hiva Oa, and most of the Society islands).</p>
<p>US $ are accepted in few places (at higher exchange rates).</p>
<p>It is recommended to leave the Marquesas with plenty of CFP.</p>
<p>CFP is also the currency in use in the French territories of New Caledonia and the islands of Wallis and Futuna. Therefore keep your extra CFP when leaving French Polynesia, if you plan to stop later at one of these islands!</p>

<div><p><span>See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Members/doina/R2004-03-30-3/">Pacific List of Radio Nets</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Telephone</strong></p>
<p>International Dialing Code for French Polynesia is +689. Every town and little village has a public  call box. It is best to use a pre-paid international calling card which you can  get from the post office.</p>
<p><strong>Note (June 2014)</strong>: Both landline and cell phone numbers have been amended as shown:-</p>
<p><span>Landline: 40 + current 6-digit number</span></p>
<p><span><span>VoIP line (internet phones): 49 + 6-digit number starting with 9</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cell phone: 87 + 6-digit number starting with 7 or 2</span></span></span></p>
<p>The cellular operator in French Polynesia is "Vini". <span>It's useful to have a quad band cell phone UNLOCKED. You can do </span><span>pay-as-you-go; buy a sim card for $5 or $10 and then add money as you need it (although purchasing a SIM card can be difficult). Cell access is surprisingly good in French Polynesia, even out in the Tuamotus.</span></p>
<p><strong>Internet</strong></p>
<p>Internet access is possible in most of the major anchorages near towns of any size, although it is very slow. (2016 prices: approx. US$10 for 3 hours – prices vary slightly from one provider to the other). You can sign up and pay online for a block of time after connecting your WiFi antenna to the provider’s network. <span>You may need to buy blocks of time from 3 or 4 different providers, because coverage varies from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span>A long range WiFi antenna is <strong>very useful</strong> to have. Coverage is pretty spotty in the Tuamotu: Rangiroa, North Fakarava, Makemo, Manihi, Tikehau, and perhaps a few others when anchored near a post office (see Vinispot info. following).</span></p>
<p>"<b>Vivispot</b>" (<a href="http://www.vinispot.pf"><strong>www.vinispot.pf</strong></a>) <span>is a provider from the French Polynesia postal service and as such operates in all islands where there is a post office, i.e. even in some of the remotest outer islands like the Australs and Gambier.</span></p>
<p>However the WiFi range is sometimes limited. The Marquesas are ok, eg Fatu Hiva (Hanavave Bay or Bay of Virgins) with a great vinispot signal, also Taiohae Bay. In <span>Papeete it was better than the marina</span> WiFi. Further west, the signal was not so good. Check their website for locations. You can buy access cards at the post office, or sign-in online using a credit card. In many post offices you can also use your access card to connect at the post office public computer which is available free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>“<span>HotSpot-WDG</span>”:</strong> this is another WiFi internet provider, with WiFi zones in all Society islands, Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa and Ua Pou in the Marquesas, and Manihi, Rangiroa, Fakarawa and Tikehau in the Tuamotu. You can sign-in online using a credit card, or buy access cards at their WiFi zone stations like hotels or  “pensions”, or marinas (check their website home page for locations).</p>
<p><span><strong>"Iaoraspot": </strong>C</span><span>r</span><span>uisers can also use this </span><span>privately owned WiFi service run by a yachting-affiliated person. They are reported to have a better Wi-Fi signal, but not necessarily a faster internet connection. Iaoraspot has WIFI zones in all Society islands, Nuku Hiva, and Hiva Oa in the Marquesas, Rangiroa, and Fakarawa in the Tuamotu, and Mangareva in Gambier.</span></p>
<p>You can sign-in online using a credit card, or buy access cards at their WiFi zone stations like hotels or  “pensions”, or marinas (check their website home page for locations). <span>From their home page you can also get free of charge weather forecasts from: Windguru (various islands), Meteo France website (very complete including satellite pictures of the South Pacific), and 7 day GRIB files covering all of French Polynesia.</span></p>
<p><i>August 2012:</i> <strong>OminAccess</strong> has expanded its high speed network coverage in French  Polynesia - see <a href="http://www.omniaccess.com/"><strong>www.omniaccess.com</strong></a> for more  details.</p>
<p><strong>Mail</strong></p>
<p>If hoping to receive anything by normal express post, remember that post offices  will only hold items for 14 days before returning to sender. The alternative is  to give a hotel or cruiser-friendly outfit as a mailing address. Mail first  arrives in Papeete, Tahiti, but then if not addressed or invoiced properly, will  often just get stuck there. Advice is to get the sender to scan the invoices of  the goods and the postal invoice and email them to you.  Then you must make sure  you have the invoices for the goods and the postal invoice on the outside of the  package.  Also in large letters somewhere other than the small address label,  you should write the name of the yacht and “YACHT IN TRANSIT”. If all else fails  go to the PO with your tracking number, a scanned copy of both your boat registration and the customs form copy which they give you on check in,  PLUS scanned copies of the invoice. The head of the PO  can then e-mail the customs/PO Papeete attaching your scanned copies  and with  luck you should receive your packet without having to pay import duty.</p>
