            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Anguilla is a self-governing British Overseas Territory, and the most northerly island of the Leeward Island chain. Nearest neigbour to the south is St. Martin/Sint Maarten. </li>
<li>The main attraction of Anguilla is the fact that the changes that have occurred elsewhere have largely left Anguilla untouched. There are several delightful bays both on the south and north coasts of Anguilla, while those in search of blissful solitude can do no better than Scrub Island, off the north east end, and Dog Island, north of Anguilla.</li>
<li>Anguilla is noted for its ecologically important coral reefs, as well as its spectacular beaches.</li>
<li>Yachting facilities are very basic and for any major repairs it is currently necessary to go to neighbouring St Martin. A new marina planned for Gull Pond, Shoal Bay West may change this.</li>
<li>Sadly, many cruisers are deterred from visiting the country due to the high cost of a cruising permit required to visit anywhere but Road Bay.</li>

<div><p>Based on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft from yachts is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</b> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><b>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</b> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><b><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/ </a></b></p>
