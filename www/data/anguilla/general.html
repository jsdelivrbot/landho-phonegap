<div><p>The local currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$). It is fixed to the US Dollar at EC$2.7 = 1 US Dollar.</p>
<p>US Dollars are accepted everywhere, including government offices.</p>
<p>Most major credit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>There are several ATMs at various places arround the island.</p>
<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit andcredit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p>

So if for example you want to use the sim bought here while cruising through other islands, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or you can set up an account and do it online, but you cannot get it topped up in another island.<br/>You can top-up Digicel at </span><a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p></div>
