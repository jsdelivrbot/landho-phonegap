<div class="hello"><div><p>Goa is a small state situated midway up India’s western coast. Due to its ethnic mix over the centuries, Goa has a multi-hued and distinctive lifestyle quite different from the rest of India. English is widely spoken here.</p>
<p>Panaji (previously known as Panjim) is the state capital, and is located on the banks of the Mandovi river.</p>
<p>Goa port is usually closed during the monsoon season (mid June to mid September).</p>
<p>Position 15° 29'29"N, 073° 48'27"E</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>It is now a requirement that all yachts use an agent for clearance here.</b></p>
<p>All yachts are now also required to give a Pre-Arrival Notification (PANS) <strong>72 hours</strong> before arriving in Goa (Panaji Port). This notification must be sent to:-</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Captain of Port Panaji</span></li>
<li><span>Superintentent of Customs Panaji</span></li>
<li><span>Superintentent of Immigration Branch</span></li>
<li><span>Commander Indian Coast Guard, Goa</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>On arrival at the port, it is </span><strong>essential</strong><span> to call the Port Authority on VHF channel 16 for permission to enter.</span></p>
<p><span>All officials for Clearance are located here, but scattered around the town. However, the cost of a taxi to visit them is not large. Both Customs and the Port offices are by the Betim ferry dock on the southern side of the river, and there is an Immigration office about a mile away on Swami Vivekanand Road.</span></p>
<p>Remember, all crew must have a visa in advance. See <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/India?rc=Formalities">India Formalities</a></b> for full clearance information.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is little in the way of facilities available in Panaji for cruising yachts, now that the pontoons have been removed from the Panaji Yacht Station. </p>
<p>The Verem Bay anchorage now has a Casino Boat moored to four large permanent moorings, but it is still possible to anchor there to the west of the Casino boat moorings (though it means a long dinghy trip to either shore).  </p>
<p>It should also be possible to anchor in the river on the south side, upriver of the Captain of Ports jerry and shortly before the Patto Bridge. </p>
<p>There are public toilets and showers all over the City.</p>
