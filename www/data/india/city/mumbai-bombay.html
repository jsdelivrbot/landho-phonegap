Visitors can collect free of cost from the club the Customs and Immigration clearance forms and complete clearance formalities; the Club can help with this without any charge.</p>
<p>The club gives honorary membership to visiting sailors for a fee of about $9 (US) and allows them to use its facilities. </p>
<p>The club's members can also give advice if any repairs need to be done. HF, VHF, GPS, Engine, Hull, and various other repair facilities are available. The yacht club anchorage is a good place to leave a yacht if wishing to travel inland. Tindel (Seaman) from the club will take good care of the boat on request and at no cost.</p>
