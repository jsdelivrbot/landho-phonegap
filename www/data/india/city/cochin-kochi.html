<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a modern all-weather port and a rapidly growing maritime gateway to peninsular India. The city offers a perfect blend of the traditional and the modern. It is a major tourist destination encompassing tranquil backwaters, heritage and historical sites, antique shops, spice trade centres etc.</p>
<p>After a stopover here by the Volvo Ocean Race in 2009, there is a much bigger interest in sailing, and the new "Kochi International Marina" officially opened on 24, April 2010. Unfortunately, due to the piracy in the Northern Indian Ocean, yachts have been avoiding taking the Red Sea route and consequently the number of yachts visiting Cochin has fallen dramatically in recent years.</p>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>For full details see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/India?rc=Formalities">Indian Formalities</a></b>.</p>
<p>Port Control must be contacted on both arrival and departure once in the approach channel. Call on VHF channel 16.</p>
<p>Yachts must anchor for clearance off the steamer point on the north tip of Willingdon Island, opposite the two jetties of the port office and the Taj Malabar Hotel in front of the Port Trust Building.</p>
<p>The port office, immigration and customs are now all located next door to each other, which makes clearance simpler, however not necesserily quicker. Expect clearance to take most of the day. Note, some boats have reported being allowed to proceed to the marina and complete clearance the next day. Customs seems to take the longest.</p>
<p>No one must land before clearing Customs, who will come out in a launch. The captain can then go ashore and clear at the port office (open 10:00-17:00), where port dues must be paid.</p>
<p>A useful contact here is Nazar 72 (+91 98 95 164090). He speaks some English, but his son, Nisam, is better, so ask to speak to him. They are most helpful and will guide you through the clearance process.</p>
<p>The Customs and Immigration offices must be visited next. Customs will retain the ship's papers until departure and issue a receipt (ensure this is retained as it is required when clearing out). The Immigration office will issue landing passes or stamp passports.</p>
<p><span>After clearance, one may then go to the yacht anchorage south of Bolgatty Island, or the new marina at the Bolgatty Palace Heritage Hotel on the east of Bolgatty Island. Boats drawing more than 6 ft (2 m) should wait for high tide as the channel is shallow in places. Written permission from the Port Captain must be obtained if one moves to another area.</span></p>
<p>With prior warning, yachts planning to call at Kondo Syokai for repair, can call on them for assistance with clearing.</p>
<p>You can leave your boat in Cochin and travel inland in India. If you want to leave the boat there and travel out of the country, you will need special permission from the authorities in Cochin. The boat must have a guard onboard  or be stored in a recognised boatyard/workshop. Contact: Deputy Conservator's Office, Cochin, Tel: 04 84 666871, Fax: 04 84 668163.</p>
<p>If planning a day sail from the port, Port Control must be advised in advance, by fax, stating vessel, crew and duration of the trip (in hours).</p>
<p>The Coast Guard are likely to come alongside to check when sailing in the vicinity of the port.</p>
<p>After clearing out, you have three days in which to leave.</p>

Cruisers have reported that another boatmen tries to impersonate him. Do not be confused by this other 'Nazar' who often wears a baseball cap &amp; jeans.

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> The anchorage south of Bolgatty Island off the Bolgatty hotel is free and quiet and good for an extended stay. Water is no longer supplied by the hotel, but standpipes are available.</p>
<p>From here by dinghy you can visit Ernakulum, the modern site of Cochin. Ferries to fort Cochin run daily as well as ferries to Willingdon Island.</p>
<p>The Taj Malabar hotel is welcoming to cruisers who can use their facilities (bar, restaurant, internet, pool).</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="Countries/india-pics/kochi_international-marina/@@images/image/preview"/>Docking</strong><br/> The Kochi International Marina, which opened in April 2010, is part of the Bolgatty Palace Heritage Hotel on the east of Bolgatty Island. Unfortunately limited yacht traffic due to piracy zones expanding, has resulted in the marina being greatly under used. This caused it to fall into some disrepair for a while. However since April 2012, the new management have made many improvements.</p>
<p>The entrance channel is shallow and the water full of siltly mud, so the depth sounder may read zero! It has been reported that boats with a 2.5m draft have made it up there. Keep to the west side of the channel and approach at high water slack. The entrance to the marina is difficult due to the tide and tight finger pontoons. Assistance is required.</p>
<p>In Old Cochin (<span>Mattanchery)</span> is a small boatyard run by John Crabtree with limited dockage for yachts. There is a watchman here. Several cruisers have recommended this facility (see reports adjacent). <span>The location is good with restaurants and shops nearby, however the area is not so clean and it is very shallow.</span></p>
<p>One thing to note when staying here, is that Kerala is one of the wettest places on earth and installing an air conditioner is essential if you wish to avoid the boat becoming full of mould.</p>
<p>The Kerala Watersports &amp; Sailing Organisation (KWSO) are very active in <span>promoting the </span><span>Sport of Yachting in Kerala. Find out more at </span><a href="http://www.keralawatersports.org/" target="_blank"><strong>www.keralawatersports.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lakshadweep Islands</strong></p>
<p>From Kochi, yachts can visit these islands, renowned for the incredible diving, however a permit is required. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/India?rc=Formalities#Restrictions">Restrictions</a></strong> for details on how to apply for a permit (not easy). <span>Alcohol nor bikinis are allowed and there is a very basic infrastructure (a few guest houses) with 5 diving schools. </span><span>The main 5 islands have mooring buoys in their lagoon with entrances well marked  - but one should be careful.</span></p>
