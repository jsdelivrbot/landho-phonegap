            </h2>
<div><p>Clearance formalities can be very time consuming in The Gambia (see  <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Gambia/Banjul">Banjul</a> for specific port  clearance information). All official offices will need to visited; Immigration,  Customs and the Harbourmaster, and various forms will need to be filled in,  lists of crew and stores compiled etc.</p>
<p>Don't expect the offices to have the necessary blank forms or paper available.  If possible, get a copy of the Clearance certificate from a shipping company in  adavance, otherwise you may have to hand draw one! Also, take plenty of paper  and pens with you.</p>
<p>Contrary to what you might be told, offices are not open 7 days a week. Try and  arrange to arrive on a weekday. The fees charged will probably depend on the  official you see. It is also possible that no change will be given, nor a  receipt issued. Yachts have reported paying fees ranging from $25 to $150 with  some of the smaller yachts paying more than the bigger ones. How you present  yourself may also affect the fee you are charged. A small gift (i.e. chocolates,  cigarettes, lipsticks) are appreciated and may smooth the way.</p>
<p>The yacht may or may not be inspected.</p>

<div><p><strong>October 2014: </strong><span>The Gambian government has closed its air borders with Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. The government has also announced that any international traveller who has been present in one of these 4 countries within 21 days of arrival in The Gambia will not be allowed to enter.</span></p>
<p>From 1st October 2013, Gambia is no longer a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is not yet known if this will affect immigration requirements.</p>
<p>For citizens of the United Kingdom, full members of the European Union, the  Commonwealth, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and several other countries do not require a visa for visits of up to 28 days. Passports are stamped on arrival and an extension can be obtained for another 28 days.</p>
<p>Those arriving without a visa are allowed 2 days to obtain one at the Immigration  Office in Banjul. Visas cost 500 Dalasi (12€) per person for the first month.  Visas can also be extended here for another month (or in Kaur, or Farafeni), for  the same price.</p>
<p>If you do not have all your crew with you when visiting Immigration, they may want  to come and inspect the boat.</p>

<p>Gambia has strict laws on the import/export  medications. Visitors arriving with  substances containing hydroquinone, hydrocortisone, betamethasone, flucinonide,  clobestatol, or clobestatone must have a doctor's prescription or may be subject to fines up to $2,000 and/or three years  imprisonment.</p>
<p>Travellers in possession of prescription drugs should carry proof of their  prescriptions, such as labeled containers. Police have been known to arrest  foreigners carrying unlabeled pills.</p>
<p>Customs will probably want to come and inspect your boat.</p>
