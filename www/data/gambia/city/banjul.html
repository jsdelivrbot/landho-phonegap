<div class="hello"><div><p>It is recommended to arrive here during the week when all the offices are open for 
Clearance. The average depth in the channel is 30 ft (9 m). Vessels should keep 
all buoys to starboard when entering. Port Control keeps a continuous watch on VHF 
Channel 16 on weekdays and should be contacted prior to arrival.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Visiting yachts can either anchor off the big oil tanks next to the harbour and 
go inside the harbour by dinghy for clearance, or proceed to the government 
wharf or commercial dock and tie alongside.</p>
<p>If anchoring, be sure to take all the crew ashore with you. It's unlikely the 
officials will be interested in inspecting your boat if a dinghy-ride is 
required. At the dock, various officials may want to come on board for 
inspection. You will be accosted by "helpers" when you arrive, but refuse all 
help, it is easy to visit the offices yourself.</p>
<p>Money for clearance can be obtained in the town. From the pontoon, walk through 
the harbour and go out of the main gate. Turn right and follow this road in to 
the town centre to the police station. There is a bank just opposite.</p>
<p>The Immigration office is in the harbour (on left as you come over 
bridge from wharf), and should be visited first. Next Customs (when you come 
from the pontoon turn left after the first building and follow that road for 
approx. 500m. Customs is the last white building on the left). Finally visit the 
Harbourmaster (big blue building in the middle of the harbour). His office is on 
the top floor, through the second entrance. Permission to visit the river for 
approx. 25€ can be obtained here. </p>
<p>Both Customs and Immigration may want to inspect the boat. Although the 
officials are reported to be very friendly, the formalities tend to be time-
consuming (approx. 5 hours) and a stock of small presents (cigarettes, lipstick, 
milk powder, old shoes, children's colouring supplies etc.) will smooth the way.</p>
<p>The Gambia Yachting Association acts as an agent for visiting yachts and may 
approach yachts on arrival to offer their services with clearance formalities. 
If using them, a fee should be agreed in advance.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to have your yacht anchored off Banjul port to clear out. It 
is possible to take your documents by road from Lamin Lodge, for example. 
Clearing out does not cost anything. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Anchoring:</b><br> 
For clearing in/out anchorage is at Half Dike, by Banjul Pier. Shelter is 
usually adequate. </br></p>
<p>For a longer stay, the best place is at Lamin Lodge (13.23.637N 16.37.562W). It 
is a very sheltered spot in the mangroves, with a bar/restaurant and dinghy 
dock. It's a bit of a walk to the main road, but then catching a bush taxi to do 
the shopping is no problem.</p>
<p>Taking up (for a fee) of an offer to show you around is worth doing, as it is a 
difficult place to find your way about on a first visit.</p>
<p><b>Cruising the River</b></p>
<p>Yachts can easily go all the way up to Georgetown on the river, the best areas 
are above Baboon Island. At Georgetown there is a power cable across the river, 
however cruisers report it is possible to go further up to Basse at low tide on 
the north bank in a smaller yacht with one man at the masthead (see reports 
adjacent).</p>
<p>Cruising the river with the tide is comfortable and when you want to stop you 
just anchor close to the side. There is an abundance of wildlife (hippos, 
monkeys, crocodiles and birds). Always put anchor lights on at night as there 
are a lot of fishermen with long drift nets. </p>
