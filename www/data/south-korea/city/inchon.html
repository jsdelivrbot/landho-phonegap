<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Inchon experiences an extreme tidal range. When the tide is out, most vessels are layed up on the mud. This is fine for flat bottomed fishing boats, but not for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A large marina close to Inchon is Jungok Marina at Hwasung city. It is one hour distance by car from Seou and 40 minutes from Inchun airport. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This 300 yacht capacity marina has a 20 ton crane, fuel and marina club house with restaurants. Good professional repair services. </span></span></p>
<p><span>A new marina - Wangsan Marina - is due to open in May near to Inchun port.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Last updated March 2016.</span></span></p></div></div>
