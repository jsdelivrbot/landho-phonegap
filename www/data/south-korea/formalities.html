<div><p>Entry formalities and dealings with officials can be difficult and time-consuming, as very few officials speak English or any other foreign language.</p>
<p>Because of the delicate nature of South Korea's relations with North Korea, the military authorities are extremely suspicious of any foreign vessel. Also, as it is forbidden to sail in South Korean waters at night, it is essential to time your arrival in daylight.</p>
<p>Although no cruisng permit is required, it is necessary to clear in and out with the coast guard at every stop and one is also likely to be stopped by various patrol boats belonging to the Navy, coastguard, marines or Customs. Generally, though, the officials are friendly.</p>

<div><p>All visitors must have a passport valid for at least 3 months.</p>
<p>Visa regulations change frequently and although currently visitors from many  countries (The E.U., USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia) may visit for up to 90 days without a visa, it is recommended that anyone planning to visit South Korea by yacht should obtain a visa in advance.</p>
<p>There are South Korean embassies in most capitals and also consulates in neighbouring countries, such as Japan, where there are consulates in Kobe, Shimonoseki and Fukuoka, the latter being reported as the most efficient in granting a visa.</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.immigration.go.kr/HP/IMM80/index.do"><strong>Korean Immigration</strong></a> website for more information.</p>
<p>For those whose passports contain evidence of visits to North Korea, special permission is needed to visit, and one should apply for a visa at least one month in advance.</p>
<p>Extensions are difficult to obtain. If longer than a 90-day stay is planned, a special long-term visa must be obtained in advance and one will have to apply for a residence certificate at the local immigration office.</p>
<p><span>Carry some form of identification at all times.</span></p>
