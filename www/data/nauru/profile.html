<div><ul>
<li>The Republic of Nauru is one of the smallest countries in the world, an eight square mile coral island, lying just south of the equator, west of Kiribati.</li>
<li>A stark island with little vegetation, but once a very wealthy state due to its phosphate resources. Now, with the mine nearing exhaustion, the country's future is very uncertain. </li>
<li>In 2008 Australia ended its policy of housing refugees on the island, however this was reinstated in 2012 with much opposition. See comment below about latest news reports.</li>
<li>Nauru is a pleasant enough island and can be a useful stop, especially in an emergency, for boats bound for the Solomons or Papua New Guinea, as it has good provisions and also fuel.</li>
<li>There is only an open roadstead in the lee of the island, very deep for anchoring, where some mooring buoys have been laid for large ships. If there is not too much surge and there is space available, it may be preferable, if draft permits, to try and enter the small boat basin.</li>
