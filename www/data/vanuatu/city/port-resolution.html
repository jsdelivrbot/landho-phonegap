<div class="hello"><div><p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Home to Mt Yasur, considered to be the world’s most easily accessible active volcano, a stopover in Port Resolution with a trip to the volcano should not be missed. </span></p>
<p><span>Take care on entering this poorly charted harbour. The people of Port Resolution love yachts visiting and truly enjoy getting to know yachties.</span></p>
<p><span>Port Resolution suffered a lot of damage when Cyclone Pam devastated this Pacific island chain in March 2015. See the comment at the bottom of the page as to how you can help if you plan on visiting.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>New Rules 2014:</strong> Vessels may not call at Mystery Island (Aneityum), Port Resolution (Tanna) or any other place in Vanuatu <strong>unless</strong> the Director of Customs &amp; Inland Revenue grants <strong>prior written permission</strong>. Masters of vessels who visit these places prior to obtaining inwards clearance and being issued with an “Inter-island Cruising Permit”, or obtaining written permission may be subject to fines and/or prosecution.</p>
<p>If planning to visit here, it is worth obtaining this prior written permission as the <span>trip from Lenakel to Port Resolution is very tedious </span><span>in normal trade wind conditions.</span></p>
<p>Customs, Immigration and Quarantine are all based in Lenakel on Tanna’s SW coast. The harbour at Lenakel however is small and fairly open so in the past boats would anchor at Port Resolution and take a 4x4 car over to Lenakel on the other side of the island to clear in. However, it is now necessary to obtain <strong>prior permission</strong> to do this <span>from Vanuatu Customs and </span><span>Inland Revenue, or </span><span>face large fines. </span></p>
<p>See the<strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Vanuatu/vanuatu-clearing-in-at-port-resolution"> RCC's report</a></strong> - May 2015.</p>
<p><span>Once you have obtained prior permission to clear at Port Resolution, on arrival Werry at the Yacht Club will contact Customs and Immigration who will travel over from Lenakel to inspect and clear you. </span></p>
<p><span>Note that there is a fee of 5000vatu for Customs and 5000vatu for Biosecurity for clearing in at a port other than a Port of Entry. There is also a charge of 15000vatu for the officials' travel costs (2 hours over the horrendous road from Lenakel and 2 hours back again). </span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Resolution offers the best all around anchorage on Tanna with a sandy bottom, but it is open from ENE to NNE and is shallow (4m), so in winds over 15 knots, the anchorage becomes very uncomfortable. The anchorage can be rolly and a stern anchor may make life more pleasant.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The Port Resolution Yacht Club are always happy to help with any tours, transport or provisioning needs. The glow of the volcano is visible from anchor at night and in certain winds you can expect to receive a light dusting of volcanic ash. </span></p>
<p><span>The growing number of yachts visiting Tanna has caused some problems, the biggest one being yachts leaving their rubbish behind or worse, burning it on shore. What makes this hard is if you ask a person in the village if you can leave trash or burn it they will almost always say yes.  That’s their culture, they do not say no and do not tell you when you do something wrong. Be sure to take your rubbish away with you.</span></p>
<p><span>Port Resolution did suffer extensive damage during Cyclone Pam in 2015 (see report below under comments by SY Tenaya). </span></p>
