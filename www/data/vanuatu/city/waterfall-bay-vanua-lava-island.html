<div class="hello"><div><p>This anchorage on the West coast of the island and is better protected from the swell than Vureas bay, 7 NM south. It is sheltered from NE &amp; SE tradewinds (but open to infrequent westerlies). </p>
<p>Anchor in black sand in about 40 feet. You can land your
dinghy on the small black sand beach in front of the Yacht Club (look for the
channel through the coral reef especially at low tide).</p>
