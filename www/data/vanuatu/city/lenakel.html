<div class="hello"><div><p>Being able to now stop at Tanna is a great advantage as it allows yachts arriving from the east or south to make landfall at Tanna first and visit other islands en route to capital Vila, rather than face a tough beat to windward to visit some of the southern islands of Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is a 15min. car trip from White Grass Cove to Lenakel.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This is one of the four official clearance ports for Vanuatu. </span><span>See </span><a href="Countries/Vanuatu/PortVila/Countries/Vanuatu/Sola/Countries/Vanuatu?rc=Formalities"><strong>Vanuatu Formalities</strong></a><span> for detailed information on Clearance.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Remember:</b><span> </span><span>24 hours prior notice of arrival is required by Customs.</span></span></p>
<p>Quarantine and Immigration formalities are completed at the police station. <span>There is now a permanent customs office on the island.</span></p>
<p>There is a bank in Lenakel where foreign currency can be changed into Vatu only, but there is no ATM and cards are not accepted. Cash advances on credit cards can be had at Evergreen Bungalows. The nearest ATM facilities are in Port Vila.</p>
<p>If wishing to stop at Aneityum after clearing out, it is important to get prior permission to do this, and to include the time you plan to spend there when calculating the fees due for your stay in Vanuatu.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Lenakel is located on the west coast of Tanna, and is not a good harbour because of exposure to SE swell making it <span>quite a rolly anchorage when the wind is in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span>The wharf is an unsuitable berth for yachts.</span></p>
<p>Traditionally cruising yachts use <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Vanuatu/PortResolution">Port Resolution</a></strong> on the east coast as a base while visiting the island, from where one can cross the island to Lenakel on local transport.</p>
<p>The Black Sands anchorage is about 4nm north of Whitegrass Cove.</p>
