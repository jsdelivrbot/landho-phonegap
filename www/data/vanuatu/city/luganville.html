<div class="hello"><div><p>This is one of the four official clearance ports for Vanuatu. See <a href="Countries/Vanuatu/PortVila/Countries/Vanuatu/Sola/Countries/Vanuatu?rc=Formalities"><strong>Vanuatu Formalities</strong></a> for detailed information on Clearance. Tax-free fuel is available here - see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Vanuatu/Luganville?rc=MarineServices#Fuel">fuel</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p><span><strong>Remember:</strong><span> </span><span>24 hours prior notice of arrival is required by Customs.</span></span></p>
<p>On entering the harbour, fly the Q flag and call customs or Santo Port Control on Channel 16 or working Channel 12. Officials might not answer outside of office hours.</p>
<p>If conditions are too rough to anchor, arriving yachts may pick up a mooring off Aore Island Resort on the southern side of the Segond Channel and dinghy or take the shuttle back across to the Customs, Quarantine and Immigration offices on the main wharf. It is not recommended to tie up to the main wharf.</p>
<p><span>The immigration office is located in the last building just before you </span><span>take a turn right for the harbour from the main road going east from </span><span>Luganville. The blue building is a bit lower than the road level and not </span><span>marked in any way. A taxi driver will know the way.</span></p>
<p>The customs office is inside the commercial port, first building on the right. Customs will contact Quarantine, and in general, both Customs and Quarantine agents will want to visit the yacht to collect fresh fruits, vegetables, and garbage.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is no marina in Luganville. Three anchorages are convenient to town:</p>
<p><i><span>Between the petroleum and cruise ship wharf just north of the no-</span>anchor zone:</i><br/>Here there is a plateau of sand in 12 to 15 meters with good holding. A pilot boat is often moored close by. This spot does get alot of wind and will be rolly in trade wind conditions. It is also not ideal on Sundays, when cruise ships usually visit. Dinghys can be conveniently landed a little to the west at the dock of a big hardware store. Make sure not to tie to the cleats, as they are used for their delivery boats and your dinghy may be moved. Be sure to approach this dock very close to the shore (in particular at low tide) as there is a reef south of the dock that can not be crossed with a dinghy.</p>
<p><i>Beachfront Resort:<br/></i><span>This anchorage along a sandy beach is located just west of </span><span>the Sarakata River, west of Clemenceau Point and east of the three ruined </span><span>iron wharf structures from the WWII era. This is the preferred yacht </span><span class="im">anchorage on the Luganville side of the Segond Channel. Holding is good in 5-15m in sand. The anchorage is relatively open to the east, and especially at high tide in the afternoon the anchorage can be choppy. Dinghies may be landed on the beach at the Beachfront </span><span>Resort. Taxis frequently pass by on the road next to the anchorage, a ride typically </span><span>costing 200 Vatu. There is 3G mobile reception available and the resort may </span><span>allow you to use their Wifi.</span></p>
<p><i>Palikulo Bay:</i><br/>The anchorage at Palikulo Bay is well protected and quite beautiful, but it's about a 30-minute ride from town. Buses to Luganville only leave in the morning and evening. Taxis and cars rarely pass this area, so it would be very wise to negotiate a taxi ride in advance or call one via mobile phone. The taxi ride is usually 1.500 Vatu. Hitch hiking is an option, but you may not find a single car passing you for a long time. There is 3G mobile reception available.</p>
<p>A very popular anchorage is situated in <i>Peterson Bay around the Oyster Island Resort</i>. The anchorage is almost a cyclone hole and numerous cruisers end up staying here much longer than planned as they enjoy the hospitality of Greg, the quiet anchorage, the good food, fast satellite internet connection and numerous activities in the area (blue holes, snorkeling on WWII plane wrecks, hiking etc.). Transport to Luganville is relatively easy to find.</p>
<p><b>Rubbish Disposal</b></p>
<p>Luganville rubbish disposal is handled using pre-paid bags, if rubbish not in these bags is left it will not be collected. There are however several public rubbish bins available that yachts can use and rubbish in any bags can be disposed of here. Be sure to ask once ashore where the public bins are located to help keep Luganville clean.</p>
