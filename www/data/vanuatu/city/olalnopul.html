<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The villagers at Olal have built a brand new yacht club and bar and organise the annual Rom dances and Back to My Roots festival. Unfortunately very few yachts visit and tend to anchor an hour's walk away as Olal is not in any of the cruising guides or pilot books. </span></p>
<p>Yacht Ohana visited Olal in August 2014 and their blog has alot of useful information about this anchoarge. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.yit.co.nz/blogs/ohana/2014/pilotage-chart-olal-ambrym-vanuatu">http://www.yit.co.nz/blogs/ohana/2014/pilotage-chart-olal-ambrym-vanuatu</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p>A new airstrip is under construction at Olal, due for completion in 2015.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Olal</b></p>
<p>This small anchorage on the North tip of the island <span>is a good anchorage in most conditions and has much better protection from the West than Nopul. Deep draft boats however will have a problem anchoring here.</span></p>
<p><span> The reef offers good shelter from all sides except </span><span>from the north. <span>Holding is good but avoid the rubble near the reef which could snag an anchor.</span></span></p>
<p><b>Nopul</b><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Neighbouring Nopul is a bigger anchorage, but it </span><span>means a very long walk to Olal including crossing a ford which can be impassable </span><span>after heavy rain.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This anchorage is sheltered from E &amp; SE tradewinds (open to infrequent westerlies). Anchor in black sand in 30 to 60 feet. You can land your dinghy on the black sand beach. Walk up the hill to the house of Chief Masing to say hello. Chief Johnson also welcomes contact with yachties. They can direct you to Olal.</span></span></p>

      See Chief Sekur in Olal. An easy 40-min walk from Nebul Bay or a dinghy ride along the coast if calm weather. The yacht club was inaugurated by 8 yachts in 2007 during the inauguration of the first Rom Nakamal in the South Pacific.
Both the Nebul and Olal chiefs and villagers are very keen on welcoming cruisers in their community.
