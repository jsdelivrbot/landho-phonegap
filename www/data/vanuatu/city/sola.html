furthest North port of entry in Vanuatu. If planning to visit the Torres and Banks 
Islands, this should be the last port of call in order to clear out of Vanuatu.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is one of the four official clearance ports for Vanuatu.</p>
<p>For a long time the office here was unmanned, however Vanuatu Customs announced on August 11th 2015 that the office here has now re-opened for yacht clearance.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="Countries/Vanuatu?rc=Formalities"><strong>Vanuatu Formalities</strong></a> for detailed information on Clearance.</p>
<p>There is a bank in Sola, but it will only change foreign bank notes, no travellers  cheques or credit cards, so it may be better to arrive with some vatu.</p>
<p>Last updated August 2015.</p></div></div>
