<div class="hello"><div><p>Asanvari Bay is the calmest anchorage on Maewo. The anchorage is well protected from tradewinds (open to NW to SW winds). Anchor over rock and coral in 30 to 60 feet. You can land your dinghy ashore in front of the yacht club. A small dinghy channel is marked by 2 range posts ashore and a green LED light at night.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Chief Nelson and son Nixon welcomed yachts here for many years. Earlier cruisers helped them get foreign aid to build a proper Yacht Club and to install a small hydro-electric generator near the Bay's waterfall. However sadly the Chief and yacht club are no more. There are plans to rebuild it.</p>
