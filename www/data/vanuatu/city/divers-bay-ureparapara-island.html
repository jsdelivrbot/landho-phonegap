<div class="hello"><div><p>This anchorage inside the old volcanic crater is well protected from tradewinds but can be rolly with Easterly winds. Chief Nickelson advise to anchor at
13°32'478S,167°20l516E as there is a lot less swell right there. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Titinson Yacht Cultural Centre welcomes cruisers. No airport here so if you look
for really isolated people, this is one place where people are very friendly and
hope for more visitors! They have to go about 20 miles by speed boat to get to Sola
so you can guess they do not see many visitors at all except for a few cruisers.
Easy stop on your way to the Solomons and easy island to reach even if you only
visit the Banks before going back down to Santo or Vila!</p>
