<div class="hello"><div><p>This friendly island is the most southerly in Vanuatu and is no longer a port of entry.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same distance from Lautoka as Port Resolution but is a superb anchorage, easy to get into and safe in anything but a westerly blow.</p>
<p>Position 20°11'S, 169°49'E.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several anchoring spots. The one SE of Inyeug is sheltered from N, W and 
SW winds. Anchoring east of the wharf gives shelter from the south. This island 
should be avoided in a westerly blow. The anchorages on the north coast of 
Aneityum are also good. </p>
<p>The diving is good here and cruisers are welcome to snorkel off Mystery Island, 
the islet that provides protection for the anchorage, but NOT to take lobster or 
fish as this is an important marine reserve. </p>
<p>The Anelcauhat Primary School, directly ashore from the dinghy landing channel, 
greatly appreciate donated school supplies, dictionaries or primary school books. </p>
