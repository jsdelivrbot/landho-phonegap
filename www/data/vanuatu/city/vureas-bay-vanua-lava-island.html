trail to there, so the best way is to sail there if needed.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This anchorage, on the SW corner of the island, is protected from the tradewinds but can be quite rolly in SE trades. Waterfall bay, just 7 nm north is better protected from swell. </p>
<p>Anchor in black sand in about 20-40 feet. You can land your
dinghy on the long black sand beach, left of the village (locals may help you pull you dinghy on top of the sand dune, away from the surge).</p>
