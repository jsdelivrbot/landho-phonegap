<div class="hello"><div><p>The Milli bay anchorage is about 4h walking from the villages all on the SE tip of the island but is very picturesque if you like solitude. You can also anchor about 30-min walk away from the village at around (13°41.582'S, 167°37.829'E) between reefs outcrops. </p>
<p>The problem anywhere on the west coast is the deep water all the way to
the fringing reef. One solution is to temporarily anchor in 50ft and make up a
mooring on a nearby 10ft coral/rock to limit our scope and to be really secure in any wind direction. Access to the island anywhere is indeed difficult at low
water since the fringing reef dries (unless you can easily carry your dinghy
across a coral plateau). The easiest seems to dinghy around the SE point before
Rah island.</p>
