<div class="hello"><div><p>Port	Vila,	the	Capital	of	Vanuatu, is	a	sheltered	anchorage	for	yachts	 with	one	of	the	most	beautiful	natural	harbours	in	the	world.</p>
<p>The port lies on the SE side of the island of Efate (Shefa).</p>
<p>Position 17° 44'31"S, 168° 17'30"E (entrance to the bay)</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is one of the four official clearance ports for Vanuatu. <span>See </span><a href="Countries/Vanuatu/Sola/Countries/Vanuatu?rc=Formalities"><strong>Vanuatu Formalities</strong></a><span> for detailed information on Clearance.</span></p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <span>24 hours prior notice of arrival is required by Customs.</span></p>
<p>Clearance here is reported to be simple, fast, friendly and painless.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Port Vila, anchor in the quarantine zone near the YELLOW  buoy. This is just north of the lead markers in some 8 to 20 meters depth. Have  your yellow quarantine flag flying.</p>
<p>Call Port Vila Harbor Control on Channel 16. They keep radio watch from 07:30 to  16:30. If they do not answer, try Yachting World on Channel 16 or 60. They will  contact Customs and Quarantine for you.</p>
<p>Offices	 are	open	Monday	to	Friday	from	08:00	to	16:00	hours,	Saturdays	 from	08:00	to	12:00 and	are	closed	on	Sunday	and	public	holidays.</p>
<p>If you plan to arrive on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday, the boat must remain in the quarantine area until Monday. <strong>Do not go  ashore</strong> without first clearing in or without explicit instructions by radio or  telephone from Customs officials instructing you otherwise.</p>
<p><span>If you or a member of your crew expect to take an airplane flight out of Port Vila on a Sunday, be sure to see Immigration and Customs on the previous Friday.</span></p>
<p>Customs, quarantine and immigration are reported to be very helpful, as are the  Yachting World crew. See <a href="Countries/Vanuatu/?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Vanuatu  Fees</strong></a> for  Clearance costs.</p>

<p><span><strong>Havannah Harbour - North West of Efate</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This is another beautiful spot to spend some time and is well sheltered. Visiting yachts can hire a </span><span>private mooring known as ‘Daves Mooring’ </span><span>by contacting Jane on +678 779 2227. The buoy can be found at approx. position 17 35.35S 168 14.53E (opposite </span><span>Jane's house with orange walls). Water is available from Jane and rubbish can be left ashore.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Rubbish Disposal in Port Vila</b></span></p>
<p>Port Vila rubbish disposal is handled using pre-paid bags. If rubbish not in these bags is left, it will not be collected and there are very few public rubbish bins available. For vessels in the quarantine anchorage, there are bins for cruisers located behind the small tour kiosk beside Nambawan Café (the building with the long thatch roof). Rubbish in any bags can be disposed of here and municipal pre-paid bags can also be purchased from Nambawan Café. <b><i>These services have been volunteered to help yachties keep Port Vila clean, so please support Nambawan Café and advertisers.</i></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Luganville also operates on the pre-paid bag system but has many more public rubbish bins available for use.</p>
