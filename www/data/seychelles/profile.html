<li><b>Update August 2016</b>: An outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Reunion and Rodrigues has resulted in strict food import restrictions. See this <a href="Countries/ReunionIsland/reunion-island-rodrigues-an-outbreak-of-foot-and-mouth-disease"><b>Noonsite report</b></a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The Seychelles number over 100 islands, some granite, others coral atolls including one of the world's largest atolls, Aldabra. This is now a world heritage site and permission to visit it must be obtained in Mahé. Having been uninhabited by man until 200 years ago, the islands are rich in unique wildlife, such as the giant land tortoise, many species of birds, strange plants such as the giant Coco de Mer, and untouched forests.</span></li>
<li>Mahé, La Digue and Praslin have all been developed for foreign visitors to enjoy these natural advantages, but the number of tourists is kept controlled.</li>
<li>The best anchorages are on Mahé.  The outlying island anchorages are very exposed and subject to uncomfortable cross-swell conditions. The anchorages at La Digue and Praslin Islands are particularly striking and one of the chief attractions on the latter is Baie St Anne, with its thousands of Coco de Mer palms, some of them reputedly 800 years old.</li>
<li>The strict controls imposed on cruising yachts in the early 1990s have been gradually lifted and formalities are no longer so complicated, although some restrictions remain in force. Most of these are meant to protect this truly unique environment.</li>
<li>With the increase in the number of cruising yachts visiting the Seychelles and also because some charter boats are based there, facilities are steadily improving. All repair services are concentrated in Victoria, where there are several boatyards with slipways. Two new marinas have opened on Mahe, as bases for charter operations but with facilities available to visiting yachts.</li>
<li>There are also limited facilities on Praslin and La Digue.</li>

<div><p><span>Sadly crime, such as opportunist theft, has increased in the Seychelles in recent years and normal security p</span><span>recautions should be taken as with elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>In July 2015 a number of boats were boarded at night at anchor in the inner yacht basin in Port Victoria, Mahe. All times it was by swimmers (possibly the same men every time) who stole whatever they could lay their hands on. The one time they were confronted by the yacht crew, the situation turned violent. See report <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Seychelles/seychelles-mahe-port-victoria-night-time-boardings-and-thefts-july-2015">here</a></b>. Local P<span>olice recommend cruisers lock their boats at night, lock and lift their dinghies and check their outside decks for anything that can be used as a weapon against them.</span></p>
