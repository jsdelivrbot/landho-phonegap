            </h2>
<div><p><span>All vessels visiting the Seychelles are reminded that Port Victoria is the only port of entry and exit, and that both on arrival and departure for a foreign port vessels must call at Port Victoria to complete clearance formalities.</span></p>
<p><em>Arrival</em><br/> It is best to contact Port Control 2 hours before arrival and fly the "Q" flag. Port Control keep a 24-hour watch on VHF Channel 16. Yachts are generally directed to the quarantine area in the yacht basin. Holding is good here.</p>
<p>The Health, Customs, Immigration and security officials usually board the yacht for clearance and will be brought out to your yacht in a pilot boat. The Entomological Department may require the boat to be sprayed on arrival.</p>
<p>If arriving at a weekend or public holiday, the captain must report to the Port Office, Mahé Quay, through the Port Security Gate on Latanier Road. An arrival form must be completed and the boarding fee paid. Three crew lists and the ship's papers should be taken, and the latter will be held until departure.</p>
<p>The captain must also report to the Immigration office, Independence House, Victoria, with crew lists and passports.</p>
<p>It is possible that the passports will be held until departure from the islands.</p>
<p>The authorities recommend having at least ten copies of crew lists, as other departments will also ask for them.</p>
<p><em>Departure</em><br/> On departure from the Seychelles, first visit the Immigration office two working days prior to departure with all passports and permits. One day before departure, obtain port and customs clearance, the latter from the Customs office, Latanier Road.</p>
<p>Port clearance is needed to visit any of the other islands. Clearance must be made within working hours (08:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00 Monday to Friday).</p>
<p>Before leaving Victoria to visit other islands, port control must be advised on VHF Channel 16. Usually one is asked to come to the commercial wharf for a security check before being allowed to leave. The same operation must be followed on one's return, when a yacht is subjected to an incoming security check before being allowed to anchor.</p>
<p>On the other islands, one must check in with local police or the Island Manager, who will sign the clearance form which must be returned to the port office within 24 hours of one's return to Victoria. At weekends and public holidays the form can be left at Mahé Quay police station.</p>
<p>Not all these regulations are enfored, but it is best to be prepared.</p>

<div><p>No-one needs a visa to enter the Seychelles but a passport, valid for the period of the visit is required by all.</p>
<p>Passports may be retained until departure.</p>
<p>On arrival you will be granted a permit to stay for 30 days, this can be extended for up to 3 months at a time to a maximum of 12 months. This is done at the Immigration Office. It is worth asking for an extended permit initially if required, as some cruisers have reported that a 5 week permit was granted upon asking.</p>
<p>Application for the renewal should be made at least one week before expiry of the existing permit. The application form can be <a href="http://www.egov.sc/Resources/Forms/Vice%20President%20Office/Application%20for%20Extension%20of%20Visitor's%20Permit.pdf"><b> downloaded here</b></a>.</p>
<p>Crew leaving the yacht in the Seychelles must first obtain an authority from Immigration. If crew are arriving by air to join a yacht, the captain must give Immigration written confirmation prior to their arrival.</p>

<div><p>A vessel may visit the Seychelles for 12 months and must then leave or pay GST of 15% and make a formal application for importation. The insured value of the vessel will generally be accepted.  Yacht valuations by a local expert can be extremely expensive, of the order of $2000. If GST has been paid the vessel may stay on indefinitely. The 12 month rule will be relaxed for reasons of safety, such as avoiding pirates.  A vessel that has visited for 12 months and left without paying GST may not return for 36 months.</p>
<p>All arms and ammunition, including spearguns, must be handed to the police or Customs on arrival and a receipt obtained. The bonded firearms will be returned on departure.</p>

<div><p>Import Permit required for pets and necessary Health Certificate and Rabies Vaccination Certificate. Pets from rabies-free countries will be quarantined for 14 days - otherwise 30 days quarantine (or 180 for rabies affected countries) The Seychelles are rabies-free so regulations regarding animals are strictly adhered to. Yachts with animals on board will only be allowed to visit other islands if pets are not let ashore. They must be always kept confined on board in port. Only with special written permission from the Veterinary Section may animals be taken ashore. Illegal landing of animals can lead to a heavy fine, imprisonment and confiscation of the animal, which may be destroyed.
