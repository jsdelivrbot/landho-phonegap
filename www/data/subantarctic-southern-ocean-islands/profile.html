<div><p>These islands lie north of 60°S and the Antarctic Treaty Area, so are administered by their respective governments. Most are uninhabited and often have pristine environments unspoilt by human contact. To preserve this, visits are restricted or prohibited. Yachts should exercise strict precautions to avoid introducing non-native animals (e.g. rats) or pests, which has already occurred in some places much to the detriment of the indigenous flora and fauna. It is best to follow guidelines as those for the Antarctic.</p>
