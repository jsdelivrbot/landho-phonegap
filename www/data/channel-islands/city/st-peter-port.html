<div class="hello"><div><p>Port Control monitors VHF Channel 12. Visitors should call about one hour prior to arrival to receive berthing instructions. One of the port launches normally meets arriving yachts and directs them to a berth.</p>
<p>A red light on the pier at the port entrance indicates large vessels are under way, and only boats of 15 m (49 ft) or less may enter or exit if keeping clear of the main fairways. Do not anchor or berth without the prior permission of the harbour master.</p>
<p>Customs and immigration documents will be handed to you on arrival and these must be completed before anyone goes ashore. The forms should then be handed to a customs officer or deposited in one of the yellow customs boxes. All arriving vessels must clear in at the main harbour in St Peter Port before proceeding to one of the marinas.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a ferry port and <span>manoeuvring </span><span>space is limited, so take especial care when entering or leaving the harbour.</span></p>
<p>The Victoria marina lock is open approximately 2 hours each side of HW. If arriving outside this time, the harbour launch will direct you to an appropriate holding pontoon. The harbour authorities are well organised here. Having sorted out the boats beforehand, a launch will then lead each boat to a berth when the lock opens and departing boats have cleared the entrance.</p>
<p>If departure time dictates, or your boat is unsuitable for the Victoria Marina (max. length 12.8, depth 1.8m) it is possible to remain in the outer harbour on the Swan pontoons. During the summer, these pontoons are linked to the shore, but they have no water or electricity. Large yachts must contact the Harbour Authorities in advance and they may be able to be berthed in the <span> Queen Elizabeth II marina (after clearing Customs).</span></p>
<p>Anchoring in Havelet Bay (free) might be a better option if the weather is suitable (not in strong SW'lies).</p>
