<div class="hello"><div><p><i>Gorey Harbour</i></p>
<p>Only suitable for yachts that can dry out; drying moorings (yellow buoys near the pierhead) for visitors available, also a few spaces against the wall for fin keeled yachts.</p>
<p>Facilities:  showers, toilet, fuel, water, provisions and restaurants.</p>
<p><i>St Catherine's Bay</i> to the north, is also a good harbour providing sheltered deep water anchorage from winds from the SW to the North. Many local moorings, so choose carefully when anchoring. Fin keeled yachts can anchor well in, especially at neaps. Holding is good in a mixture of mud/sand. Landing slip at the base of the breakwater.  No facilities except a water tap and public toilets on the shore. Exposed to the E/SE. A wonderfully peaceful spot.</p>
