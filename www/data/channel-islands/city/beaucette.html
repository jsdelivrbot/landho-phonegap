<div class="hello"><div><p>This marina is situated in an old quarry on the NE corner of Guernsey. It is approached via a marked channel from the Little Russell. There are leading lights, but daylight is advisable when entering for the first time.</p>
<p>A quieter option than St Peter Port but some distance from any shops. Taxis, buses and hire cars available.</p>
