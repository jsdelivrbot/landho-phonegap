<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour provides good shelter except in strong NE or E winds. If such conditions are forecast, it is best to leave, if possible, as the harbour can be untenable.</p>
<p>There are 70 large yellow visitors' buoys and <code>Mainbrace</code> provides a water taxi service during the season (VHF 37). Room to anchor in the harbour is limited but, depending on the wind direction, various bays around the island provide limited shelter.</p>
<p>St Anne's is the only town on Alderney and is a 20 minute walk uphill from the harbour.</p>
<p>The Harbourmaster's Office is at the SW end of the harbour, near the entrance to Little Crabby Harbour.</p>
<p>The Dinghy pontoon, dinghy slipway, showers, toilets, launderette, telephones, chandlers and a skip for rubbish are all nearby; the launderette is in the same building as the showers, and uses £1 coins - both are open 24 hours a day in the summer, but the showers are closed in the winter.</p>
<p><span>Plans have been dropped for the construction of a 24-hour tidal access marina in Alderney.</span></p>
