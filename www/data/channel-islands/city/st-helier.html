<div class="hello"><div><p>There are three marinas in St Helier, but only St Helier Marina (the'Town marina') is normally open to visiting yachts. The all-tide Collette Basin, previously available to visitors, is now reserved for residents only.</p>
<p><i>St Helier marina</i> is close to the centre of the town and recently the number of available berths has been increased. If arriving outside the cill opening times (approximately HW +/-3hrs), moor to the holding pontoon just to port of the marina entrance - close to the gate for those yachts planning to move inside; further back for those planning to stay outside. On busy weekends, the rafting up required here is quite something! There is a digital tidal gauge by the cill.</p>
<p>The approach channels, through this rock-strewn area, are well marked, but as there are several converging from different directions, it is important to identify the correct marks on the chosen route. Also, beware of the cross tides, which can be up to 4 knots. The number of high-speed ferries using this port make a good all-round look-out essential.</p>
<p>In settled weather, there are many anchorages in the various bays along the south coast of the island.</p>
