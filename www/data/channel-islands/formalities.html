<div><p>Although the Channel Islands are Crown Dependencies, they are <strong>not </strong>part of the United Kingdom and Customs requirements differ. The islands are not part of the EU and are outside the VAT area of the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Jersey</strong> <br/>Simplified clearance procedures for visiting yachtsmen means that most are not obliged to carry out Customs and Immigration formalities. They remain liable to inspection at any time but not required to fill in forms or make declarations.  Those arriving from outside the European Economic area, have non European Economic Area nationals on board or have any goods to declare (including prohibited or restricted items) will still have to fly the yellow "Q" flag and fill out the JCE 112. No one except the captain may go ashore until formalities are completed.</p>
<p><strong>Guernsey and Alderney</strong> <br/>Gernsey still requires Customs and Immigration forms to be complete by all yachts. These will be handed to the Captain on arrival.</p>
<p><strong>All Islands</strong> <br/>All dutiable goods must be declared to Customs. No prohibited or restricted goods to be imported without the relevant licence. Prohibited/restricted goods include controlled drugs, (i.e. cannabis/heroin/ecstacy/cocain), firearms, articles made from endangered species and certain agricultural products.</p>
<p>Smuggling or suspicious activities information should be phoned in to the Customs confidential Freephone 0800 735 5555</p>

<div><p>Yachts can remain under the Islands' Temporary Importation scheme. This is a separate scheme to that of the EU.</p>
<p>Duty-free (red) diesel is still available to yachts in the Channel Islands, but if leaving the islands for the U.K. or another EU country, it is essential to retain the receipts to prove where it was purchased.</p>
<p>Duty-free (red) diesel should <strong>only</strong> be carried in the main tank.</p>
<p>Duty free goods are available to local and visiting craft upon departure from St Helier.</p>
<p>The independent operator ‘Boat Fayre’ provides a door-to-door ordering and delivery service to yachts.</p>

<div><p>Jersey does not allow animals in the marinas.</p>
<p>As a precaution against rabies, visiting yachtsmen are advised that disembarkation anywhere in the Channel Islands of all animals originating from outside the British Isles is strictly prohibited, except where the animal has been carried by a licensed ferry company.  It is also prohibited for any such animal to be allowed on deck of a visiting yacht while moored in any bay or harbour within the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>Any boats arriving with animals on board from Guernsey and the UK must go to the holding pontoon outside St Helier Marina and inform the duty Harbourmaster on VHF Ch 14.</p>
<p>If you have an animal on board your vessel and you are arriving from outside the U.K. or Channel Islands, you are required by law to ensure that:-</p>
<p>a) The animal is at all times restrained, and kept securely confined within a totally enclosed part of the vessel from which it cannot escape.<br/> b) The animal does not come into contact with another animal, other than an animal or contact animal with which it has been transported to the Bailiwick of Jersey.<br/> c) Under no circumstances is the animal permitted to land, other than under a licence issued by the Environment Division of the Planning and Environment Ministry of the States of Jersey.</p>
<p>In cases such as these, you will be asked to moor on an isolated pontoon or special berth. This will reduce the possibility of contravention of b) and c) above. You must still comply with a). The pontoon/berth may be observed by CCTV.</p></div>
