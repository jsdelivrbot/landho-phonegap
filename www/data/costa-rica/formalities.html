            </h2>
<div><p>Formalities can be lengthy and some visiting boats have had difficulties with the officials, particularly with Immigration at Golfito.</p>
<p>Ensure you have sufficient copies (up to 5 each) of all the required documents (boat papers, passports, insurance, zarpe from previous port, list of the 5 ports previously visited and crew list). <i><strong>Note: </strong>US cruisers have reported being asked for original documentation (in Golfito) and have had to place their boat in bond at a marina until the originals could be couriered to them.</i></p>
<p>Stopping along the coast before clearing into the country is not (officially) allowed, but in the north, at least, checks are not often made. However, you may be told to proceed immediately to a Port of Entry.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> See<strong> <a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></strong> for details on visiting Isla del Coco and Cana.</p>
<p>Because of problems which may be encountered with officials in other ports, it is essential to make sure at the first Port of Entry that all requirements are complied with, such as the temporary importation permit. Clearance papers from the last port or country must be shown, and also that the passports have an exit stamp from Immigration in the last country.</p>
<p>Clearance must be done with the Port Authority, then Customs, Immigration and Quarantine. Port officials will usually visit the yacht on entering Costa Rica.</p>
<p><span>You need a national Zarpe to go from one port to another (even if just going across the bay from an anchorage to a marina). </span>In subsequent ports of entry, the captain may go ashore to clear with the port captain and show the clearance certificate (zarpe).</p>
<p><span>In Puntarenas </span>Port authority working hours are 08:00-16:00 Monday to Friday, seven days a week. Overtime may be charged for clearance outside these hours.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that all forms are completed in Spanish, therefore if you don't speak the language, you might find it <span>advantageous </span><span> to employ an agent.</span></p>
<p>See <a href="Countries/CostaRica/?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a> for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure on departure:</strong><br/> The port captain at the port of departure will issue an international departure certificate (zarpe) specifying the country of destination. Those intending to stop before leaving Costa Rican waters should make this clear when clearing out.</p>
<p>Immigration must also be visited before departure.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Customs must be notified 72 hrs in advance of arrival to report a firm arrival  location and ETA.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Stay in Costa Rica</strong></p>
<p>Customs on arrival will issue a Temporary Import Certificate (Certificado de Entrada) for the yacht, valid for three months. No further extensions are now permitted. It is not possible to re-enter Costa Rica again for 3 months. (see <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/CostaRica/?rc=Formalities#Fees">fees</a> for costs involved.)</p>
<p>There is an alternative which will allow you to stay in Costa Rica for 2 years (renewable for equal periods) called a <i>Permisode Permanencia.</i> However this permission is only given to vessels that sign a slip agreement at marinas recognized by the Government of Costa Rica, such as Papagayo, Pez Vela and Los Suenos. Marina Papagayo for example has one slip available for boats staying in Costa Rica with a <i>Permisode Permanencia. </i>An agent is required to secure this permission. Costs vary between $ 900 and $ 1,500,depending on whether the yacht is owned by a company or an individual. <span>Unlike placing the boat in bond (see below), the Permisode Permanencia allows you to go back to the boat as often as you like, to stay on board and exit and enter Costa Rica with the boat without restriction.</span></p>
<p><span>The other alternative is to place the yacht in bond. The bonding agent will charge a fee. There is no official fee from Customs for this procedure. It may remain in bond for as long as you wish.</span></p>
<p>If the captain of a yacht leaves the country by other means, responsibility for the yacht must be taken over by an authorised bonding agent until the captain's return, or until the yacht's departure from the country.</p>
<p>It is advisable to seek recommendations from other cruisers before leaving your boat with a bonding agent.<!--added this bit Jan 2012 following report by Jean-Luc Avignon--></p>

<div><p>Malaria prophylaxis recommended.</p>
<p>As dengue fever appears to be endemic in Costa Rica, the necessary precautions should be taken not to be bitten by the mosquito carrier.</p>
<p>If you are arriving from a yellow fever country, such as Panama, you might be checked for Yellow Fever vaccination proof. If you are not immunized you may be denied entry.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is the one of the only central American country that treats its water to American/European standards. Most sailors fill their tanks directly from hoses, some places even plumb fresh spring water directly into the pipes.</p>
<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Costa Rica is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<p><strong>National Marine Parks</strong></p>
<p>Note that National Parks are now enforcing the requirement for a permit and making the associated charges, however not all offices know the rules so finding the correct information can be hard.</p>
<p><strong>Isla del Coco</strong><br/>Whilst there are lovely hikes here and the scenery is spectacular, this is principally a dive destination.  Application for a permit to visit Isla del Coco can only be made once you have arrived in Costa Rica as clearance papers are required. It is a complicated and lengthy procedure, especially if you do not speak Spanish.</p>
<p>For full details on how to apply for a permit read this <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica/costa-rica-cocos-island-have-a-permit-or-be-turned-away/edit">Noonsite Report.</a></b></p>
<p><span><strong>Isla Cano</strong><br/><span>Permits can be obtained from the park Office in Puerto Jimenez. Diving here only permitted with a local divemaster and a special permit is required for diving.</span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Fishing licence</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Any vessel with fishing equipment on board must have a licence. Application should be made to the Agriculture Department in San José: Ministerio de Agricultura, Calle 1, Avenida 1, San José.</p>
