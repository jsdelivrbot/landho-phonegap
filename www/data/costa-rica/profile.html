            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Costa Rica has coastlines on both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, the latter being the more attractive for cruising. </li>
<li>The hilly interior and attractive capital San José can be visited from either Puntarenas or Limón. There are active volcanos, cloud forests, hot springs and an abundance of national parks.</li>
<li>The marina which is part of the Los Suenos Resort, a luxury development at Herradura, in the eastern part of the Gulf of Nicoya, is a good base from which to explore the country.</li>
<li>Compared to Panama and Mexico, Costa Rica is expensive. Diesel, marina fees (<span>$2 - 3 per foot) </span>and provisions can be costly.</li>
<li>The beautiful Isla del Coco<span>, situated <span>532 km from the Costa Rican coast in the Pacific Ocean, is a National Park and sought-after diving paradise. A permit is required to visit which must be applied for after arriving in Costa Rica.</span></span></li>

<div><p>Costa Rica now employs a force know as the Policia Turistica who keep a serious eye out that tourists are well protected and assisted as petty theft is very common here. As with all South America countries, keep your valuables under lock and key and padlock or secure down below any valuable loose items on deck. Cruisers who have visited recommend not leaving your boat unattended at night.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica/Golfito">Golfito</a></strong> continues to have problems with outboard and dinghy theft. <span>Take maximum precautions. Lock your outboard and dinghy at all times (even in daylight when on board) with <span>a big chain so thieves cannot just cut the cables and pry </span><span>things off with crowbars.</span></span></p>

<div><p>The Pacific coast of Costa Rica is drier, while the Atlantic coast has heavy rainfall. Both coasts are hot and humid. December to April are the dry months, while May to November are wet, hot and humid. The east coast is under the influence of the NE trade winds during the winter months, but the west coast has light winds and often calms. Costa Rica is rarely affected by tropical storms.</p>
