<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica/MarinaPapagayo/Countries/CostaRica?rc=Formalities">Costa Rica Fomalities</a></strong> for full details on clearing into and out of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Quepos is now a port of entry. Clearance is available at the Marina Pez Vela but the officials are not based at the port and have to travel from Puntarenas at additional cost.</p>
<p>To enable the marina to arrange clearance a number of documents need to be sent in advance. See <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.marinapezvela.com/en/clearing-information/">http://www.marinapezvela.com/en/clearing-information/</a></b> for full details.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is not cheap, so many cruisers choose to anchor long term here. They go to Playa Biesanz, just SE of the marina. Take care as there are a number of rocks visible at low tide.</p>
<p>A steep path from shore will take you up to the road where you can catch a taxi in to town. Call from the beach (or ask one of the vendors to do so for you) and the taxi will be waiting for you at the top.</p>
<p>There is good snorkeling around the reef here.</p>
