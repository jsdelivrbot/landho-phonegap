<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very pleasant town and clearance into Costa Rica here is probably the easiest option.</p>
<p>Take care of the reef located in the middle of the anchorage (where there are no moorings) and the surf, which can make parts of the anchorage very rolly.</p>
<p><span>Position 10° 33'24"N, 85° 41'58"W (anchorage)</span></p></div></div>

<p>The Port Captain's office is half a block above the south end of the park (by the old pier) and Immigration is 2 or 3 blocks further along on the same street. The Port Captain will issue the usual zarpe. Customs are now at the airport only - take <span>a bus or rental car to the airport.</span></p>
<p><span>Clearing in here is reported to be very easy. Three copies of all papers, including passports, will be required.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are no marinas here.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor off, but choose your spot carefully.</p>
<p><span>This anchorage has a reef right in the middle. The left side facing shore is very rolly. The right side is calmer and you can anchor out almost to the island in 30 ft of water. The middle part where there are no mooring bouys is where the reef is located, so do not go there. </span></p>
<p><span>If you take your dinghy ashore, you face a difficult landing with heavy surf. It is probably easier to call on VHF Ch:16 for a water taxi.</span></p>
<p><span>Provsioning is easy here.</span></p>
<p>More comfortable anchorages can be found at Playa del Panama and Iguanita. From Playa del Panama it is possible to get a taxi or water taxi to take you to Playa de Coco for clearance. See Transport information adjacent.</p>
<p>There is another sheltered anchorage north of Bahia Cocos, at Bahia de Santa Elena.</p>
