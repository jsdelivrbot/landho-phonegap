<div class="hello"><div><p>Entering the harbour is straight forward. There is plenty of deep water to the north, east and southeast of the commercial harbour. The only offshore concern to navigation is Isla Uvita which is a small, easy-to-see, island northeast of the commercial harbour.<br/></p>
<p>The Port Authorities and Harbour Master do not recommend anchoring south of Pier 5 (numbering the commercial piers from N to S), for four reasons.<br>
1. This small anchorage area is close to the Rio Cieneguita, a river which is used by numerous high speed fishing boats.<br>
2. The Rio Cieneguita and city of Cieneguita are high risk security areas for visitors.<br>
3. There are at least four sunk vessels in the area (2 near shore, 1 just south of Pier 5, and 1 southeast of the red buoy marking the approach to the Rio Cieneguita.<br>
4. This anchorage area is 16 feet deep with good holding, yet this corner of the harbor is typically exposed to more wind, waves, and swell.</br></br></br></br></p>
