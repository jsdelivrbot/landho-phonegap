<div class="hello"><div><p>The northernmost point of entry to Costa Rica, this marina is situated on Guanacaste's Gold Coast. The International airport is less than an hour's drive away. Situated below the hurricane belt and sheltered from the easterly trade winds of Papagayo, this marina should offer a safe haven (albeit a five star one!). It joined the IGY Network of marinas in 2011.</p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> <span>It is the policy at Marina Papagayo not to fuel boats until they have checked in.</span></p>
<p>Position 10°38.14'N, 85°39.16'W.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica?rc=Formalities">Costa Rica Fomalities</a></b> for full details on clearing into and out of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Clearance and Immigration facilities are available here. The Harbourmaster uses the agent, Paramares SA, to clear boats in. This agent can also be used to secure a <i>P</i><i>ermisode Permanencia</i> (2 year cruising permit).</p>
<p>Many cruisers choose to clear into Costa Rica beforehand at <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CostaRica/PlayadeCoco">Cocos</a></strong>, where clearance is straightforward and simple.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The marina is part of Peninsula Papagayo - a luxury resort/residential community with a Four Seasons Resort hotel, a top class golf course and a Beach Club &amp; Spa.</p>
<p>The marina has 350 wet slips for yachts ranging in size from 35’ to 240’ in length. Reports are that the marina is very exposed to the trade winds which can make berthing tricky. Chafe gear and sturdy spring lines are recommended to minimise the effects of the surge.</p>
<p>The harbourmaster is reported to be very friendly and helpful, as are the staff.</p>
<p>This is a government recognised marina and as such can provide long term berthing to foreign yachts with a <i>P<span>ermisode Permanencia.</span></i></p>
