<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring is prohibited within the National Monument Marine Park of Cayos Cochinos but mooring buoys are provided in some places, the use of which a fee is charged. </p>
<p>There are a number of moorings at Cochino Grande which are maintained informally by Plantation Beach Resort and available at no cost.  The floats are empty plastic oil jugs, and the poly lines may be damaged, so check them carefully.  </p>
<p>Diving is very good, and the resort will accommodate cruisers for diving or dining ashore, with advance reservations.</p>
<p>Petty theft has been reported here. Be sure to lock your boat at night and when leaving it to go ashore or to other boats.</p>
