<div class="hello"><div><p>Also marked on charts as Cisne or Santanilla. Boats are expected to come to the dock on the SW side, but this should be avoided if there is any swell. In that case the boat should anchor. Documents are normally checked by the military, who will not issue a clearance certificate (zarpe), so papers from the previous port should not be surrendered as they may be requested at the next stop.</p>
