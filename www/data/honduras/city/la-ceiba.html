<blockquote>This is not recommended as a clearance port, a much easier and straightforward port for clearance is Utila.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br/></blockquote>
<blockquote>To complete clearance in La Ceiba, proceed directly to the shipyard and dock there or anchor in the harbour basin for a few hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br/></blockquote>
<blockquote>Avoid berthing in the commercial port as there is a "port handling fee" to pay here, payable by fishing boats, commercial boats and yachts alike, of US$100.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br/></blockquote>
<blockquote>Cruisers report that clearance and an exit zarpe will cost approximately US$60.</blockquote>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The Lagoon Marina has been closed since 2010 and its future is uncertain, therefore the only secure docking option is to </span>use La Ceiba Shipyard. Anchoring in the harbour is ok for a few hours while you complete clearance, however should be avoided overnight as there is a strong swell here. As this is a busy commercial harbour with lots of traffic, there is limited space for anchoring.</p>
<p>There is no fuel dock here but a tanker delivery can be arranged for large quantities, or there are gas stations.</p>
