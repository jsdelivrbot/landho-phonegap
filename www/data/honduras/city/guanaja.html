<div class="hello"><div><p>Guanaja is one of the Bay Islands of Honduras, approximately 70 km off the north coast of Honduras, and 12 km from the island of Roatan. Although many of the trees were destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, this island is still a green gem.</p>
<p>One of the cays off Guanaja, also called Guanaja or Bonnaca or Low Cay (or just simply, The Cay), is near the main island, and is where the majority of the locals live. The other two main settlements on Guanaja are Mangrove Bight and Savannah Bight. Smaller settlements include East End and North East Bight.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>See <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Honduras?rc=Formalities">Honduras Formalities</a></b> for full details.</p>
<p>At Guanaja Settlement (Bonaca Town), visit the Port Captain, (the office is located on the main cargo dock).</p>
<p>If clearing into Honduras, it will be necessary to visit the Immigration office. Walk past Port Captain's office to end of the path and turn right, go almost to end (2nd to last). After this, return to the Port captain again.</p>
<p>Boats must not move from Guanaja until clearance formalities are complete. Boats that have gone directly to El Bight have been fined.</p>
<p>Officials are reported as being very accommodating to cruising yachts and if coming from the East cruisers recommend this as a Port of Entry. The only charge is for Immigration, $2.50 a passport.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage at El Bight is the most protected and popular anchorage, and a convenient location for dinghy trips to Bonaca Town, the main settlement.</p>
<p>Josh Cay (AKA Graham's Cay) offers a good anchorage with good holding in the sand, protected by the reef and the cay. There is a nice open air restaurant here also.</p>
<p>An alternative anchorage is Mangrove Bight on the northern coast. The hills offer protection from E-SE winds and cruisers report strong holding with no surge and no roll.  The Clearwater Paradise resort here offers a number of services to cruising boats.</p>
