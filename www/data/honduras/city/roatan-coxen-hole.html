<div class="hello"><div><p>The Island of Roatan is located 30 miles off the coast of mainland Honduras.</p>
<p>Roatan Town, known locally as Coxen Hole, is the largest city on the Island and the main port of entry into the Bay Islands. The town has little to recommend it and security for yachts is reported to be bad, so skippers might be advised to take a taxi to the Port Captain’s Office in Coxen Hole from one of the marinas <span><span><span>or the anchorage in French Cay Harbour.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Honduras?rc=Formalities">Honduras Formalities</a></strong> for full details of clearing into and out of Honduras.</p>
<p><span>The Q flag and Honduran courtesy flag should be flown.</span></p>
<p><span>Port Clearance is done in Coxen Hole.</span> A crew list must be handed in as well as the clearance papers from the last port. A 90-day cruising permit is issued which can be easily renewed. Immigration must also be visited.</p>
<p><span>Check in at Utila is preferred, as the Customs and Immigration officials in Coxen Hole are often busy with cruise ships.</span></p>
<p>The alternative is to use an agent here for an extra fee (ask at your marina or see <a href="Countries/Honduras/Roatan/?rc=MarineServices#GeneralServices"><strong>Agents &amp; General Services</strong></a>).</p>
<p>It is free to clear in, but clearing out requires a small fee for an exit zarpe (approx. $3). See comment at bottom of page re. excessive fees charged here by Immigration.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring in Coxen Hole is not recommended.</p>
<p><span>French Cay Harbour and West End are the two favourite anchorages for cruisers on Roatan. There are a number of marinas in both places and around the Island. Facilities in these harbours are improving and there are good marine supply stores available.</span></p>
<p>Brick Bay Marina is 4 miles East of Coxen Hole.</p>
<p>Cruising the eastern end of Roatan should be done with care and avoided during the low-season when the crime rate increases. The same applies when exploring ashore. <span>Use extreme caution when off the main path, especially when in a highly noticeable rental car.</span></p>
<p><strong>West End</strong><br/> West End is a small town and West Bay is the beach. Noonsite has been advised that anchoring is now permitted here and that there are also a few mooring buoys available.</p>
<p>In Gibson Bight, West End, there is a marina.</p>
<p>West End/West Bay is badly exposed to northwest and north winds. Most local vessels move to the south side of the island if strong northerly winds are forecast.</p>
<p>Anchoring on the reef at Sandy Bay, West End Marine Park, within Half Moon Bay and West Bay, is prohibited. National Park mooring buoys are provided in these bays. A<span>nchoring is permitted to the left of the entrance at West End. </span></p>
<p><i><strong>Security Update January 2015:</strong> A boat at anchor here was burgled whilst the owners were ashore, a hatch forced open and cash stolen. </i></p>
<p><strong><img class="image-left" src="Countries/Roatan_FantasyIslandMarina_aerial.jpg"/>French Cay Harbour</strong><br/>French Cay Harbour is a large, very well protected anchorage with good holding.  <span>We have been advised that there are no mooring buoys available here.</span> There are 2 marinas: Brooksy Point Yacht Club and Fantasy Island Resort &amp; Marina <i>(see photograph left courtesy of Fantasy Island)</i>. A new haulout facility catering especially to cruising boats is also planned for French Harbour.</p>
<p>Almost everything needed by cruising sailors is available within the French Cay Harbour area, including the best provisioning on the island, banks, hardware &amp; marine supplies, doctors/dentist, a variety of dining options and a wealth of marine services. Access is via 2 dinghy docks, bus or "collectivo" taxi. Almost all goods and services needed are within a 15 minute walk of either dinghy dock.</p>
<p>The dinghy dock, commonly referred to as the 'Shrimp Dock', is private property.  The owner 'Mr. Bobby', has generously granted its use to cruisers.  Your co-operation to maintain the shrimp dock as an access point is required by following  basic guidelines - do not take water from the dock, do not dispose of garbage, and do not wander around the property.  Please be courteous to all whom you meet.  If there is someone on the dock, ASK for permission before you tie up.  Finally, the gates are locked and the dogs released at 4pm, so be aware, and beware!</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/honduras-pics/honduras_roatan_yacht-club/@@images/image/preview"/>The another dinghy dock is at the Roatan Yacht Club (see photo right) which is now closed but the security guard there will watch your dinghy for $2</p>
<p>Fantasy Island marina also can be used for a dinghy for $2 per day. Trash can be dropped off here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The whole harbour is a marine reserve and taking ANY marine life is prohibited.</p>
<p><span><span>It is </span><span>easy</span><span> to take a taxi or bus from French Harbour to Coxen Hole to check in.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Restrictions</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cruisers visiting Roatan should understand that spear fishing is not permitted by anyone, including Honduran nationals, anywhere in Roatan. (The sole exception is for taking lionfish and for that you must take a class and get a license.) Foreign nationals are not permitted to take lobster and conch at any time anywhere in Roatan and Hondurans can only take them outside the park boundaries during the open season. Fishing is only permitted by hook and line.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Roatan Marine Parks</strong><br/> In all designated marine parks no one must touch the coral or remove anything from the sea including endangered species such as conch and lobster. Dive buoys (white with a black RMP logo) and fishing moorings (black fishes) cannot be used by yachts. No sewage is to be released into the sea within 5 miles of any Honduran coast. Failure to observe regulations may result in a jail sentence or vessel being impounded. Spearfishing is prohibited to tourists on ALL areas of Roatan. There is virtually no enforcement capability.</p>
<p>The latest Marine Park regulations can be found at the Roatan Marine Park website (see entry below).</p>
<p><!--removed as now ban there - The anchorage at West End/West Bay is well protected in normal tradewind conditions but badly exposed to northwest and north winds. The mooring buoys at the north end are mostly private and permission should be asked before using.--></p>

<!--Have removed all text as on website and now anchoring ban in west end 280412. In West End anchoring is not permitted. There were 20 maintained mooring buoys here, however the mooring balls have been removed leaving the lines floating and attached to the pins. Be aware of these lines when coming into West End; they may drop deep enough making it difficult to pick up with a hook.
Note: the following rules are currently (April 2012) not being enforced as no one is administering the marina park following the confusion that resulted from the new mayor's proposed eviction of all cruising yachts from West End. See news item adjacent.
Normally there is a mandatory mooring fee of $10 per day, $40 a week, and $100 for a month. Call to check availability before heading to West End. Dye tablets are supplied which must be placed in the yacht’s holding tanks to ensure that no black water is discharged. Any vessel found leaking sewage will be asked to leave immediately and anyone found dumping sewage will be fined. Spearguns are not permitted within the Reserve without a licence.-->
