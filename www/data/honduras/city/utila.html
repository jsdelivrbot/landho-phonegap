<div class="hello"><div><p>Utila Island is well known for the great diving on the mesoamerica coral reef and it's funky, laid back attitude. Puerto Este (otherwise known as Utila Town) lies at the easterly end of the island. There are alot of Europeans here and English is widely spoken.</p>
<p>Following quite alot of theft by locals from yachts in the past, Utila has become much more cruiser friendly in recent years. That said however, be sure to secure anything left on deck, in particular valuable items such as dive tanks and dinghies (see reports adjacent).</p>
<p>Utila is a big party place at night, so it's advisable to have a watch person on board if leaving your boat to go ashore after dark.</p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Port Captain and Immigration Officer can be found in their offices on the town dock during weekday working hours. Check in is said to be straightforward and cruisers recommend this as a good place to check into Honduras.</p>
<p>Documents required are: a complete crew list (four copies in Spanish), the passports of all on board, a copy of the ship’s papers and a clearance fee of US$5 per person.</p>
<p>No Customs clearance is required.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The anchorage does not have great holding. Be sure to anchor in a sandy patch in deep water (+20ft) and dive on your anchor.</p>
<p>Yachts can anchor east of the concrete town dock, in the area off the fuel dock  (marked by two high, cylindrical, white tanks); alternatively, the area farther to the east, inside the harbor’s protective reef. Another anchorage is available west of the Municipal Dock, near the easterly end of the town’s beach.</p>
<p>Petty theft continues to be reported here, in particular gear left on deck from yachts at the East anchorage.</p>
<p>If going ashore to provision, cruisers recommend using Bushes dinghy dock as they will look after your dinghy. They also have good fuel.</p>
