<p>Yachts anchor off the naval base.</p>
<p>Checking in at Puerto Cortez is simple, professional and free. The captain must go into town to clear with the port captain and immigration. It´s a 30 limpera cab ride  to the Port Captain and Immigration is walking distance nearby.</p>
<p>Officials are in the centre of town so it´s easy to do shopping as well. Prices here are much lower than in the Bay Islands and it is a recommended port by cruisers for checking-in and re-provisioning.</p>
<p>Checking out costs are <span>$5 per passport to immigration, </span><span>about $0.40 for copies about $1.75 for an international zarpe.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>A new marina/haulout facility/5 star hotel is planned for Puerto Cortes. </span></p>
<p><span>In March 2015 a charter yacht was boarded by pirates not far from here, en-route from Belize to Roatan (see report adjacent). Care should be taken to avoid remote stretches of coastline here as a lone yacht.</span></p>
