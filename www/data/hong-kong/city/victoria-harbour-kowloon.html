<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several marinas here, some of which are private members clubs. Berthing charges are expensive compared with other Pacific locations.</p>
<p>For more options see the <a href="Countries/HongKong/NewTerritories"><strong>Hong Kong/New Territories</strong> page.</a></p>
<p>It is possible to anchor anywhere in Hong Kong Harbour but many places are choppy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p><a href="Countries/HongKong/NewTerritories"></a></p>
<p>Aberdeen harbour lies on the southern side of Hong Kong Island and is a designated typhoon shelter. However, it is not a comfortable place to anchor.</p>
<p><span>The Aberdeen Boat Club has two clubhouses; one in Aberdeen Harbour with a long dock for pick up/set down only, and another at Middle Island, further to the east. This is the cruisers' preferred option and provides safe typhoon moorings and anchorage.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many small yards in the immediate vicinity of Aberdeen Harbour which can undertake most repair jobs.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several yacht clubs, which usually offer temporary membership to visitors if they are members of an overseas club or are introduced by a local member. Most clubs have some moorings and also repair facilities.</p>
<p>The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in Causeway Bay has the best location and is also a typhoon shelter. It has some places available for visitors on floating pontoons, but the maximum draft is approximately 10 ft (3 m). Moorings are also available, from where one commutes by sampan to the club house. Repair facilities are good and there is also a travelift. The yacht club is close to all amenities. If no space is available, it is better to try one of the marinas out of town.</p>
