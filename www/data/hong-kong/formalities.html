<div><p>The Hong Kong Port Operations Service operates on VHF Channel 12, 14 and 68, call sign <code>MARDEP</code> 24 hours a day. Yachts may be boarded and searched in Hong Kong territorial waters, as illegal immigration and smuggling are major problems.</p>
<p>On arrival, non-commercial yachts may go to an anchorage or a yacht club (usually the Royal Hong Kong YC).</p>
<p>Within 24 hours of arrival report to Immigration (2nd Floor, Government Pier, Central - open 24hrs) and then the Marine Department, (Pleasure Vessel, 2nd floor, in the same building - normal office hrs). A General Declaration form must be completed and port and light fees paid.</p>
<p>To cruise in Hong Kong waters, a <i>permit to navigate</i> must be applied for.</p>
<p>Any of the marinas or the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club will advise on the correct procedure.</p>
<p>It is necessary also to report to the Port Formalities Office again before departure with the necessary papers. A Port Clearance Permit must be obtained before departure, which is valid for 72 hours.</p>
