<ul>
<li>Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on 30 June 1997, but its special status will continue for another 50 years.</li>
<li>Hong Kong is made up of the small Hong Kong Island, the commercial centre, and the Kowloon Peninsula, the main district for shopping and entertainment. Between the two lies the well-protected Victoria Harbour. Also part of Hong Kong are the New Territories, a large area on the mainland, as well as some 235 islands, many uninhabited, in the South China Sea.</li>
<li>Although offering limited cruising opportunities, Hong Kong is rarely bypassed by yachts cruising in the Far East, who are attracted by the excellent service and repair facilities available. There are several yacht clubs and a thriving sailing community, visiting yachts being always warmly received in this dynamic metropolis.</li>
<li>Under the auspices of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, it is now easier to visit China itself and Macau.</li>

<div><p>The climate is subtropical. June to September is hot, humid and rainy. October to January is cooler and less humid. The typhoon season is from May to December with the highest frequency between June and September.</p>
<p><em>Typhoon procedures</em> Typhoons are most likely in September, but can occur all year round. When a typhoon is expected, information and warnings are broadcast in 15 minute intervals day and night. Visiting yachts may seek refuge in an approved typhoon shelter, of which there are 14 in Hong Kong for small craft, some for less than 50 m LOA, others for less than 30 m LOA. Alternatively one can secure to a government B class mooring, for which advance booking is necessary. Yachts too large for the shelters can either find a mooring or a sheltered anchorage, notifying the port authority of their position.</p>
