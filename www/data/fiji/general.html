<div><p>Fijian dollar (FID, FI$). A maximum of FI$100 can be exported in local currency, and FI$500 in foreign currency.</p>
<p>It is better to regard all transactions in Fiji as being cash transactions and plan accordingly. Very few places take cards, and those that do will normally charge a 5% fee.</p>
<p>The only bank in Suva that will let you use a card to withdraw cash inside the bank is WESTPAC.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> On leaving Fiji, the bank regulations will cause difficulties when trying to change your Fiji dollars to another currency, particularly <span>Vatus (Vanuatu) or Australian Dollars.

<p>International Dialing code for Fiji is +679.</p>
<p>Mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns but coverage in some rural areas and outlying islands can be limited or non-existent. Global roaming needs to be activated on mobile phones, but making and receiving calls can be expensive.  Many visitors buy a Fiji SIM card on arrival. These are relatively cheap to buy and calls, both local and international. Fijian SIM cards are available at Nadi International Airport and at convenience stores and supermarkets. Registration of a SIM card purchased locally is mandatory.</p>
<p><span>In Fiji, it's all 3G. <span>Ensure you get a good WiFi booster and a 3G/4G Router before arriving. Latest reports (and local advice) is that Digicel now has the best coverage, speeds and lowest prices for internet connections.</span></span></p>
<p><span>A Flashnet "data stick" from Vodafone also has good coverage and reasonable speeds in most anchorages, but is more expensive.</span></p>
