            </h2>
<div><p><span><strong>Prior Notification of Arrival</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">Yachts arriving from overseas now only complete the revised Advance Notice Form C2-C (this is much longer and comprehensive than the old one pre-2013). The previous requirement to also complete and email the Biosecurity, Customs and Health forms no longer applies. Just the one form C2-C suffices. Download it from <a href="http://www.frca.org.fj/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JOINT-C2C.pdf"><strong>www.frca.org.fj</strong></a></span></p>
<p>This revised Form C2-C<strong> must </strong>be emailed or faxed to the Fijian authorities <strong>not less than 48 hours</strong> prior to arrival. It can be much longer than this if convenient. It is also necessary to attach a scanned photo of your boat and also a copy of the Captain’s passport. You send these 2 pictures, along with a scanned copy of your completed Form C2-C. This is a <strong>NEW</strong> requirement.</p>
<p><span>This form is a lengthy one and sailors should take care to be in a place where there is good internet bandwidth to upload attachments (for example in </span><span>Vava’u in Tonga the bandwidth is not enough)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>The forms and pictures can be emailed or faxed to the Customs office at  <strong><a href="mailto:yachtsreport@frca.org.fj">yachtsreport@frca.org.fj</a> </strong>or faxed <span> (679) 330 2929 or 3301186. Alternatively, phone <span>(679) 324 3000.</span></span></p>
<p>Cruisers have  reported that when they asked for it, e-mail confirmation of receipt was sent by  Customs.</p>
<p><span>If the form is not able to be sent for whatever reason, send an email to </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="mailto:yachtsreport@frca.org.fj" target="_blank">yachtsreport@frca.org.fj</a> </strong></span><span>stating why this can’t be done and wait for (and keep) the reply from them. B</span>eing forced to stop in Fiji due to sail and engine problems will invite a  thorough inspection and difficulties in obtaining a cruising licence.</p>
<p>The current fees for out of working hours Customs Clearance, <span>Biosecurity and Health fees have recently increased. See <a href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a> below. </span></p>
<p>Have a printed copy of your C2-C form for the authorities when you check-in.</p>
<p><span>Also required in advance of your arrival, you are required to send a short email to Biosecurity advising them of your estimated arrival time and port. Send this to </span><strong><a href="mailto:yachtinfo@biosecurityfiji.com" target="_blank">yachtinfo@biosecurityfiji.com</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Clearance Procedures</strong></p>
<p>On arrival in Fiji waters, fly the 'Q' flag.</p>
<p><span>On approach, contact Port Control on VHF Channel 16 to request </span><span>permission to enter the  port. You may or may not get an answer, but make the call regardless. Proceed directly to the designated quarantine area indicated on the  chart for the port of entry you have chosen. Await instructions or arrival of the  correct authorities.</span></p>
<p><span>The authorities you will need to see in order to clear into Fiji are </span><span>Customs, Immigration, Biosecurity and Health. No one else should be allowed to board the vessel, nor any person or  article leave the vessel, until all clearances are granted.</span></p>
<p>Working hours for clearance are from Monday to Thursday 08:00-13:00, 14:00- 16:30; Friday 08:30-13:00, 14:00-16:00. Overtime charges will need to be paid  outside of these hours. Documents required are: Clearance certificate from the  previous port or country; Crew list with details of passport numbers,  nationality and age; Valid passports.</p>
<p><strong>Weekend Arrival:</strong><span> Remember, if you arrive at the weekend you may well be obliged to clear in at the weekend which incurs substantial overtime charges (</span><span style="text-align: justify; ">See </span><a href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities#Fees" style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Fees</strong></a><span style="text-align: justify; "> below</span><span>).</span></p>
<p><i><strong>Bio-Security</strong> </i></p>
<p>This should be the first official to clear the vessel. The captain  will be instructed to await the arrival of the BAF boat or to proceed  directly to the wharf and await the BAF officer's arrival. The BAF levy a fee for this clearance which must be paid at the Divisional  Medical Officer's office. The captain should inform the authorities if there are  any prohibited items aboard.</p>
<p>Foreign vessels are requested to declare on arrival the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Foods (tinned/packed), including meat, sausages, salami, ham, poultry, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, honey etc;</span></li>
<li><span>Plants or parts of plants (live or dead) including vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, bulbs, flowers (fresh or dry), mushrooms, straw, bamboo or any other articles made of plant materials;</span></li>
<li><span>Animal products including feathers, fur/skin, shells, hatching eggs.</span></li>
<li><span>Animals, reptiles, fish, birds (or parts thereof), alive or dead, stuffed or mounted;</span></li>
<li><span>Soil or equipment used with animals of any kind or that has come in contact with soil;</span></li>
<li><span>Biological specimens including vaccine cultures, blood or any other biological specimen; and</span></li>
<li><span>Domesticated pets to be bonded and kept on board the vessel at all times (cats/dogs/birds etc).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Some items will not be permitted to be kept aboard the yacht for the duration of  the visit in Fiji. What is allowed to stay aboard will be at the discretion of  the BAF officer at the time of inspection.</p>
<p><span>For vessels arriving from Healthy Ports (free of Malaria, Yellow Fever or any other dangerous communicable diseases), Radio Pratique (approval to berth alongside) may be requested, however, the Health Quarantine officers may still board your vessel for inspection.</span></p>
<p>Fiji is currently free of Malaria; and would like to keep it that way. Therefore, if you are travelling from or through any of the ports that have been identified as Malarial Areas (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia (north of the latitude of Brisbane), Panama Canal, the East Indies, Asia, or any port or place in which malaria carrying mosquitoes are present) within the last 50 days, this information must be declared on your pre-arrival form. The Health Quarantine department will need to carry out an on board inspection and if arriving within 12 days, your vessel will need to be sprayed. <span>Spraying for mosquitoes (additional cost depending on the size of your vessel) is done by use of a similar spray to that used on aircraft when landing in new countries.</span></p>
<p><span><i><strong>Customs / Immigration</strong></i></span></p>
<p>Everyone needs permission from a Customs/Immigration officer before they  disembark. Port Control should be asked to send out an Immigration officer, but  if he does not meet the yacht on arrival, a message should be sent via the  Customs officer repeating this request. The Immigration Department may expect to  be reimbursed for the taxi fare to get the officer to the wharf and back.</p>
<p>If you wish to cruise in Fiji Waters, in addition to the Customs clearance you  must also obtain a clearance at any port from the Coconut Pest and Diseases  Board. Certain Islands and places in Fiji are free of rhinoceros beetle and you  may be proceeding from a dirty area to an uninfested area.</p>
<p>Cruisers report that there are copious forms to fill out in duplicate using  carbon paper.</p>
<p>There is no fee for Customs and Immigration if you do not require a visa, but it is appreciated if you have a printed copy of your C2C form ready.</p>
<p><strong><i>Health</i></strong></p>
<p>A visit to the Health Department is required by all crew and a fee paid to provide cover for medical care in state hospitals for the duration of your stay in Fiji.</p>
<p>Once all the authorities have been visited, you now need to obtain a cruising permit.</p>
<p><strong>Cruising the Islands - Cruising Permit:</strong></p>
<p>Cruising Permits (valid for up to 6 months) are issued free of charge for all areas of Fiji and now  automatically include the Lau Group. Permits are issued promptly, often "while  you wait" at the Indigenous Affairs Board (TAB), or can be obtained via a marina who normally charge a small administrative charge for this service.</p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></strong> for more details about the Cruising Permit.</p>
<p><span>Once you have your cruising permit in hand (2-3 days after arrival) you must take it to Customs to get a coastal clearance which enables you to cruise through Fiji without clearing in and out of different regions as used to be the case.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>As from 14/06/2012 it is no longer necessary to clear in and out of each  Customs region visited</i></strong> (Suva, Levuka, Savusavu, Lautoka, Lau Group, Rotuma)</p>
<p>There is a requirement however, to report your  position and current cruising plans once a week. This can easily be done by:<br/> - VHF Ch:16<br/> - Telephone: 324 3782/3747/3315 / Fax no.: as for Customs<br/> - Customs Hotline: 324 3666<br/> - E-mail: <span>yachtsreport@frca.org.fj</span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to be able to do this, in the absence of a sat phone, one may want to purchase a cell phone card from Vodaphone, Fiji, which has reception in most areas of Fiji.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Clearing Out:</strong><br/> Boats leaving Fiji must clear Customs on departure. Customs recommend 24 hours  notice of departure. Clearance will not be granted unless all port and  quarantine fees have been paid, so receipts for all these should be kept. Boats  must leave within 24 hours of having cleared customs. Some ports/marinas charge a fee for arranging outward clearance.</p>
<p>Immigration is the final authority to clear the yacht out of Fijian waters. An  appointment should be made in advance of departure advising where the boat is.  Immigration insist that boats depart immediately on receiving clearance. It is  prohibited to stop at any island once cleared out.</p>
<p>Fiji has a formidable bureaucracy which is slowly loosening up. While officials  are honest and polite, meeting the demands of the state takes time and lots of  paper. Go with the flow as you cannot avoid it!</p>

<p>All the crew must be seen by the Immigration officer.</p>
<p><strong>Visas</strong></p>
<p>A visa-free stay for up to four months (provided one has enough funds or an outward ticket) is allowed for United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and most European nationals. Visas are required by only a few nationalities (including nationals of Southern Ireland).</p>
<p><strong>2 Month Visa Extension</strong></p>
<p>After four months, an extension may be obtained for an additional two months. This costs FJ$96. Apply <strong><i>at least</i></strong> 7 days prior to the expiry of your original visa.</p>
<p><strong>6 Month Visa Extension</strong></p>
<p>21 days before this additional 2 month visa expires, <span>one can apply for an additional 6 month period, but expense for this increases dramatically and it will depend on one’s marital status as to how much it costs you.</span></p>
<p><span>One can apply for an extension under the ‘Special Purpose Permit for Yacht Owners and Crew’ in terms of Immigration. (Note: The yacht is not an issue under customs as it already has an 18 month stay granted from initial date of entry).</span></p>
<p><span>Under this permit one gets an extension as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>UNMARRIED PERSONS (including any couples without a full marriage certificate) - </span><span>FJ$477 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per person</span> (application cost) + </span><span>FJ$190 per person.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>MARRIED PERSONS (and you will need to present a copy of your marriage certificate) - </span><span>FJ$477 for the family as a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">total fee </span><span>+ FJ$190 per person.</span></p>
<p><span>Some publications state also that a copy of authority from the Ministry of Finance is also required. However in Savusavu this is not required.</span></p>
<p><span>The following is required for a 6 month visa extension:</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>1. A letter from the yacht owner or crew requesting the issue of a special purpose permit </span><span>for an extended stay in Fiji of 6 months for the purposes of maintenance, repairs and extended cruising.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>2. A letter from your Marina stating that your yacht is in attendance as are you and the crew.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>3. A copy of your updated cruising permit valid for an additional 6 months cruising.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>4. Payment in Bankers Cheque made out to Fiji Immigration Services. The only bank doing this for visitors is </span><strong>WESTPAC Bank</strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>5. A copy of the ‘Immigration Entry Clearance’ (Authority to disembark form) received on entry.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Immigration Information</strong></span></p>
<p>Crew flying into Fiji to join a yacht, must have a letter of approval from the Immigration Department prior to their flight departure.</p>

<div><p><i><b>Aftermath of TC Winston<br/>23 March, 2016:</b><br/><span>Following TC Winston and the significant damage caused to many yacht owners, the Customs team in Savusavu have amended a number of Customs regulations concerning the importing of spares and time permitted in the country, to facilitate affected yacht owners. See full details in <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji/fiji-tc-winston-aftermath-customs-regulations-adapted-for-damaged-yachts/">this news report</a></b>. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>Yachts - Length of Stay:</strong><br/>From January 2009, visiting yachts may now remain in Fiji for a maximum of 18 months without paying any duty. There is no extension.</p>
<p>After that the rate of duty is due based on the value of the boat.</p>
<p>Yachts may be sailed out of Fiji and if the same yacht re-enters Fiji within 18 months then the yacht <strong>may</strong> qualify for another period of 18 months. Futuna and Wallis (French territories) lie 300nm away.</p>
<p>Visiting yachts are reminded that the Fijian authorities are strongly against  drugs, pornography and weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Guns:</strong><br/> All weapons on board must be declared and handed over to the authorities for the  duration of your stay, otherwise you risk a prison sentence. They are normally  held in the custody of a partucular person and at least 24 hours' notice of  departure must be given. If the required office is not available, there might be  a delay. Weapons will be returned immediately before departure from Fiji.</p>
<p>If one enters at one port and exits at another, the guns may have to be  transferred to the port of departure by the police.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol:</strong><br/> The import limits for duty free alcohol are the same for any visitor to Fiji.  Fiji no longer "seals" or "bonds" alcohol, for you to consume later. Simply,  anything on board exceeding 4 litres of beer, or 4 litres of wine (2 of spirits)  will be charged import duty.</p>
<p>Import duty (if payable) greatly exceeds the actual cost of the  beer/wine/spirits and therefore it is advisable to drink up before arriving in  Fiji and purchase the local beer and wine. Spirits are expensive here.</p>
<p><i>Whilst these are the official rules, cruisers report that they are rarely  policed, especially in Savusavu.</i></p>
<p><strong>Tobacco:</strong><br/> The tobacco allowance is now lowered to only 250 grams from 500 grams. The  duties on bringing in extra personal tobacco is incredibly expensive.</p>

<p>Travellers should take the usual precautions and check the latest travel advisories before visiting affected areas.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016)</b> There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. The Fiji Islands is an area of interest for mosquito-born transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine.

<p><strong>Cruising the Islands - Cruising Permit</strong><br/>The necessary cruising permit to visit the islands is issued, on request, at the iTAUKEI AFFAIRS BOARD (Indigenous Affairs Board - TAB) office at 87 Queen Elizabeth Drive, Government Buildings, Suva, or at the the Commissioner Western's office in Lautoka, the Commissioner Eastern's office in Levuka, or the Provincial Office in Savusavu.</p>
<p><span>Permits are issued promptly, often "while you wait", or can be obtained via a marina, which normally takes 3 working days. If obtained via a marina there is normally an administrative charge of $5-10 for this service.</span></p>
<p>Cruising Permits are issued free of charge for all areas of Fiji and now automatically include the Lau Group.</p>
<p>It consists of a one-page letter, entirely in Fijian, and is valid for a period of up to six months. Unless you can read Fijian you will not know what the permit says, or when the permit expires, so it is important to clarify this: clearance will not be given once it has expired. An English version may not be available.</p>
<p><span>The permit acts as a letter of introduction to the "Turaga ni Koro" (the village head), the "Buli" (head of the provincial subdivision), or the "Roko Tui" (provincial head). </span><span>Also you will be given a set of rules and regulations which you must follow.</span></p>

<p>In the more remote areas, understanding and following Fiji’s customs is strongly advised. A visitor who ignores these customs will feel less welcome, and your hosts will be offended. Indeed they will sometimes express this with anger, and they will be less willing to help should you need their help.</p>
<p>Local etiquette should be observed and it is expected that a courtesy visit to the chief or headman of the island or village bearing a gift of yagona (kava) is made on arrival or landing and permission asked to anchor.</p>
<p>It is useful to have a good supply of kava on board, which can be obtained from Suva market. The normal gift is about half a kilogramme of kava root.</p>
<p><span>Google "Sevusevu ceremonies" to familiarise oneself with the concept, but don't worry too much as island chiefs will gladly and happily welcome you in and are overjoyed to meet sailors who are not well informed of the ceremonial practices i.e. they like to share and teach.</span></p>
<p>Dress is conservative, and is is not appropriate for women to wear swimwear or short lengths when visiting a village or house. Everyone should be covered from shoulder to knee and neither hats nor sunglasses should be worn in the village. Bags and cameras shold be carried in the hand, not slung over a shoulder. Ideally, <span>carry a sarong folded in your backpack so if you feel it is necessary you can easily tie it around one’s shorts.</span></p>
<p>Fishing rights are strictly allocated to the various villages and permission should be obtained before attempting to catch any, and then only take sufficient for your immediate needs.</p>
<p>Gifts of alcohol are considered discourteous, and its consumption is discouraged.</p>
<p><strong><i>Note:</i></strong><br/><span>A delicacy on the islands is mahi-mahi fish heads and also the tails. If you catch mahi-mahi on board, keep the heads and tails and present them at your next island for which the locals will be very grateful. They cook them in coconut milk to make a fish head soup.</span></p></div>
