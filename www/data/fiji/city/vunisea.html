<div class="hello"><div><p>Not a formal entry port unless arranged beforehand and you pay the extra expenses for the Customs &amp; Immigration officials to come from Suva. This is done sometimes by rallies since the extra expense is then shared by many yachts. If coming from another Fijian port, one needs only to have a cruising permit. Often this permit has to be showed to the village chiefs when doing sevusevu.</p>
