<div class="hello"><div><p>The channel through the reef off Tubou is very narrow (23 m wide), is only roughly marked and very challenging. About half a mile insite the reef, a channel leads to a long jetty, beyond which, is a narrow basin in which to anchor. Here there is about 6m over sand. Several anchors will be needed to ensure remaining centred in this small anchorage.</p>
<p>There is an airport with a weekly flight to Suva.</p>
<p>There are a few basic shops and a clinic.</p>
