            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Savusavu, located on Vanua Levu Island, is 125nm NNE of the capital Suva. However, most yachts from Tonga/Samoa/Tuvalu/Wallis-Futuna sail direct to Savasavu as it is well located for clearance for yachts wishing to cruise in the east of the archipelago and to Lau after clearance.</p>
<p><span>As one of Fijis clearance ports, this town has worked very hard to make clearance here friendly, simple and straightforward. </span><span>It is an attractive and friendly small tourist town which allows visitors to experience </span><span>the traditional Fijian way of life.</span></p>
<p><span>Savusavu’s popularity with Cruisers has been boosted </span><span>with the Copra Shed Marina and the Savusavu Marina adding </span><span>20 additional berths and moorings. </span><span>Cyclone facilities have also improved with </span><span>100% occupancy during the 2014/2015 Cyclone Season. The attraction of spending cyclone season here, is that there are many beautiful anchorages just a short sail away (<span>Cousteau Resort, <span>Lomaiviti Islands)</span></span>, within running distance back to safety should the weather start deteriorating.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Savusavu has however been starved of a good marina, dry dock or haul-out facility. But this will change when the Nawi Island Resort and Marina opens in 2017. </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Unfortunately in the latter part of 2014 and early months of 2015 the town has suffered a spate of crime against cruising boats (attempted break-ins, stolen dinghies etc.). See report adjacent. Cruisers should be vigilant and take due normal care, avoid putting temptation in view and employ normal security on their vessel and ashore, as they would anywhere in the world.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Refer to the main <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities">Fiji Formalities</a></strong> page for detailed clearance information including prior notification before arrival.</p>
<p><span>On arrival yachts should first hail the Port Authority on VHF Channel 16. It is unlikely you will get an answer, so then proceed to contact either the Copra Shed Marina or Waitui Marina on Channel 16 (they </span><span>are the only two operations who undertake International Clearance whether you are </span><span>using their respective facilities or anchoring out). </span></p>
<p><span>They will instruct you to pick up one of the quarantine mooring balls near the entrance and call all the relevant officials and </span><span>arrange for them to be brought to your yacht.</span></p>
<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Cruisers report that <span>Waitui marina has had major problems with their VHF radio for the last couple of seasons and therefore most clearance tends to go through Copra Shed Marina.</span></i></p>
<p><span><strong>Important: </strong>Yachts are not permitted to anchor </span><span>anywhere in Fiji waters before checking into a Clearance Port, make arrangements to </span><span>check-in immediately on arrival. Cruisers warn of substantial fines.</span></p>
<p><i>Cruisers arriving here on a Sunday have reported that the authorities forced them to clear in the same day and pay the appropriate overtime fees.</i></p>
<p><i> </i><span>Boats are visited first by a Health Officer then followed by Customs and Immigration, </span><span>Quarantine and Bio Security. The Copra Shed Marina or Waitui Marina will use their </span><span>chase boats and staff to forward officials back and forth - both charge approx. FI$15.00 for this service.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Note:</b> If you are clearing-in via Copra Shed Marina and not planning to stay on one of their mooring balls for the night, make this clear whilst on the quarantine mooring buoy as the short (3 hr) stay on their ball will cost you a full 24 hr stay at approximately FI$17.</span></p>
<p>The I’Taukei Cruising Permits which include Lau are issued free of charge (see <b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></b> for more details), but there are administrative charges ($5.00 to $10.00) from the three marina’s for obtaining these permits from Suva if you don't want to go yourself.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p id="content"><span>There are presently two marinas with alongside berthing, one marina with moorings only</span><span> and a mooring operator in Nakama Creek. </span><span>The Copra Shed Marina has a </span><span>substantial infrastructure and facilities, the other 2 marinas are more limited. The new 150 slip Nawi Marina is due to open in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Note for alongside berthing, cruisers have reported a problem here with rats and invasive birds, so it is advisable to take the necessary precautions. </i></span></p>
<p><b>Visitor Moorings</b></p>
<p>Moorings are all coloured according to the owners - m<span>ake sure you pay your mooring </span><span>fees to the correct owner! </span>Waitui Marina has 20 orange Helix moorings, Curly has 7 yellow cyclone moorings and Copra Shed's moorings are white.</p>
<p>The creek is an internationally recognised cyclone hole.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Savusavu Marina is located to the east of the mooring field. Access through the reefs to Savusavu Marina’s mooring field is a challenge for first-timers. It is advisable to call Savusavu Marina on VHF 16 for their boatman escort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ashore</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>All yachts are welcome to use the Copra Shed Marina dinghy pontoon as a means of </span><span>access to the business premises within the Copra Shed building. Those who are not </span><span>on a Copra Shed mooring and who wish to use the dinghy pontoon solely as a means </span><span>of getting into town or to do personal errands outside of the Copra Shed building, are </span><span>required to pay a fee of $1.00 per day. </span></p>
<p><span>Waitui and Savusavu Marina do not charge for </span><span>the use of their dinghy docks. </span></p>
<p><span>Curly’s shore access is via Surf and Turf Restaurant / </span><span>Waterfront Buildings large pontoon which is free to all cruisers.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note on speed limits:</strong> Be aware that there are resident sailors living on their boats in the harbour and cruisers need to be aware that there is a 5 knot speed limit and it is a no wake zone.</span></p>
<p>For information on yacht security here, see Curly's blog <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://curlycarswell.blogspot.com.es/p/anti-crime.html">http://curlycarswell.blogspot.com.es/p/anti-crime.html</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cruising Locally</strong></p>
<p>A short distance from the bay, yachts can anchor off Cousteau Resort, a convenient little spot where one can snorkel and do night diving off the point, and close enough to run back for shelter from cyclones. Also, a little further on and also within reach of a safe return, are the islands of Lomaiviti which includes the world renowned dive sites of Namena Reef.</p>

      The name Savusavu Marina is a little confusing in that it really is a sheltered bay full of mooring balls and has a spot to tie alongside a dock for perhaps 3 or 4 yachts - used for provisioning, water filling and so on.They have 20 screw moorings. Power and water on the dock plus 1 shower and toilet, laundry, freezer, garbage disposal. Free dinghy dock. There is 4m at the dock at LW. See note above about approach to the marina through the mooring field.<br>
The marina has a fully equipped workshop and boatyard plus Curly’s haulout for smaller catamarans.
