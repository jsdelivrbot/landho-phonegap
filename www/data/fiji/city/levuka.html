<p>The authorities may not answer calls on Channel 16, so it is best to anchor near  the main wharf and go ashore. All offices are at the root of the pier. You can tie up a dinghy here but it is not suitable to take a yacht alongside.</p>
<p>Occasionally  officers insist on inspecting the boat, but some appear to be put off by the  prospect of a wet dinghy ride. Formalities are usually simpler than Suva, so for  boats coming from the east, the detour to Levuka is probably justified.</p>
<p>There is a small port fee payable on departure.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of June 2012 it is no longer necessary to clear in and out of  each Customs region visited, (Suva: Levuka: Savusavu: Lautoka: Lau Group:  Rotuma:). Yachts can now clear out of the Port of Entry with a permit to cruise  all Fijian coastal waters within the bounds of their cruising permit. There is  however a requirement to report your position and current cruising plans once a  week. This can easily be done by:<br/> - VHF Ch:16<br/> - Telephone: 324 3782/3747/3315<br/> - Customs Hotline: 324 3666<br/> - E-mail: <a href="mailto:yachtsreport@frca.org.fj">yachtsreport@frca.org.fj</a></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>There are good leading marks (reliably lit) for the entrance into the reef to the east of the town, so a night entrance to the anchorage would be possible.</span></p>

<p>The anchorage off the town<i> (photo courtesy of <span>Graham Keating)</span></i></p>
<p>There is no berthing for yachts here as the wharf is unsuitable due to underwater obstructions. T<span>he anchorage is 100m off the esplanade, in the vicinity of the church. The holding can be uncertain and although t</span>he reef provides protection, in strong winds from the eastern sector, it can be rolly.</p>
<p><span>The blue building in the right of the photo is the town diesel generator (which is very noisy) and the buildings to the left are  the tuna cannery which can generate a strong fishy smell at times.</span></p>
