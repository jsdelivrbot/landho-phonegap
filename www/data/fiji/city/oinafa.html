<div class="hello"><div><p>Rotuma is a volcanic island of approximately 43 sq. kilometers, located at 12 deg. S, 177 deg. E, approximately 465 kilometers north of Fiji. Although the island has been politically part of Fiji since 1881, Rotuman culture more closely resembles that of the Polynesian islands to the east, most noticeably Tonga, Samoa, Futuna and Uvea. Because of their Polynesian appearance and distinctive language, Rotumans now constitute a recognizable minority group within the Republic of Fiji.</p>
<p>Rotuma is a garden island growing their own food with enough extra to export. Perhaps this is why Rotuma has now been made a clearance port. There are no resorts here and the locals are very friendly.</p>
<p>Oinafa, a Fiji Port of Entry, is at the NE end of the Island where safe berthing is available. Although officials are based at the other end of the island by the airport, they will travel to Oinafa for clearance. This is a useful clearance port for yachts cruising to or from the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>Flies can be a problem here and there is no public transport.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>Refer to the main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities">Fiji Formalities</a></strong><span> page for detailed clearance information.</span></p>
<p><span>Anchor at <span>12°29.49'S, <span>177<span>°</span>02.69'E by the wharf. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Contact <span>Eramasi Tumaitavuki (</span>bio security) via email <span><a href="mailto:eratumaitavuki@baf.com"><strong>eratumaitavuki@baf.com</strong></a> He will contact Customs and Health for you. VHF ch 16 coverage, except in front of the Customs office in town, is not good.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>You will be met at the dock by Customs, Immigration and Health officers and you  will need to transport them out to your vessel. The officials are reported to be  very friendly and helpful and prompt. You will need <span> FI$ to pay the fees as there is no ATM or bank.</span></p>
<p><strong>Clearing out</strong><br/> Outgoing clearance is somewhat more difficult, unless you have a Vodaphone or  Digicell cell phone with which you can schedule an appointment for clearing out.  There is good Vodaphone coverage at the dock.</p>
<p>The official offices are all at the Government Station, some 12 Kilometers from the anchorage. <span>There is an Immigration office, Customs, and Biosecurity. </span></p>
<p><span>When clearing out, you will be requested not to take any fruit with you as the island has a fruit pest not found elsewhere.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Eramasi Tumaitavuki will contact the Chief Counsel for you to meet with the Island Chieftons (7 total chiefs) for permission to come ashore.</span></p>
<p>There is a new dock near the village of Oinafa.  The most sheltered anchor is to be found as close to the wharf as possible. Safe in most conditions except for any NW swell, in which case it is best to put to sea.  There is no all weather anchorage on the island.</p>
<p>Near the Government Station is the post office, a small store, a market, the police station, the hospital, and a school.</p>
<p>The supply ship only calls about once per month and even then, provisions are limited. <span>There is a fresh produce market across the road from the store that was open in the mornings.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers recommend a helpful local man called Philippe (just ask any villager in  Oinafa and they can direct you). He can organise island tours etc.</span></p>
