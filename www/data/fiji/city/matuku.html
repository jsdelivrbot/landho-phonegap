<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a beautiful, verdant, high volcanic island, with its crater open to the west through a wide, clear pass. There are seven villages spread around the coast. The main village is Yaroi, on the NW coast.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There is an excellent, sheltered anchorage, 10 – 15m over mud, inside the crater off the village of Lomati. Other deeper, less sheltered anchorages are in the channel inside the pass, to the north of the main channel (17m over sand), or south of the main channel, amongst coral (6m over sand).</p>
<p>Anchorage is possible off another delightful village, Makadru, south of the pass.</p>
<p>There are more marginal anchorages inside some narrow passes on other coasts.</p>
<p>This island is very occasionally visited by yachts.</p>
