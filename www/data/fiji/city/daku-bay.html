<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Area of Daku bay belonging to Daku village - approximate position: </span><br/><span>18 58.349’S, 178 16.442’E. This bay offers all-round protection.</span></p>
<p>Yachts can also anchor off the Papageno Resort just West of  Daku Bay (approximate position: 18 57.72S, 178 14.24E ). The bottom is sand with few coral heads in about 25ft of water.  Keep a sharp lookout for the reefs shown on the electronic charts.  With good visibility, it is easy to spot isolated bommies, and the long reef extending out from the resort.  Anchoring either side of this reef offers protection from SE winds.</p>
<p>The resort monitors Ch 16 most of the time and can guide you.</p></div></div>
