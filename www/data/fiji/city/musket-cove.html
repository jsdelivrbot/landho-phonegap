      Those who arrive by yacht can become lifelong members of the Musket Cove Yacht Club on payment of one Fiji dollar (captain) and 5$ (crew). Membership gives the privilege to use the resort facilities (providing proper conduct) and also offer deep discount on the ferry service. Having the yacht's name carved into one of the overhead beams is no longer done as the beam is full. The club organises the Fiji Regatta Week in September every year.
Showers, toilets, water, garbage bins, mail, telephone, fax, and e-mail at the office.
There is a dinghy dock and a small number of berths are available on the club pontoon, but need to be booked in advance.
