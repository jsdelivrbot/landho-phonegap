<div class="hello"><div><p>There are about 10 villages on the various islands in the lagoon and an airport with a weekly flight to Suva. The main village is Lomaloma, on the east coast.</p>
<p>The Bay of Islands, an area of raised coral and jungle in the NW is well worth a visit. <span>The village of Daliconi here used to ask for a 'donation' of $30 Fijian per head for all yachts visiting the village and the Bay of Islands (in addition to the customary Sevu Sevu 1/2 kg of Kava). However, t<span>he village has now agreed to accept donations of ANY amount or kind. In return, they can offer some services including guided tours &amp; walks.</span></span></p>
<p>A cargo ship may visit about once a month. Most villages have a post office/general store but often they will have very limited supplies. Fresh fruit or vegetables are not readily available.</p>
<p>Petrol (and sometime diesel) is often available in the bigger villages.</p>
<p>There is a health clinic here.</p>

      Anchoring is possible here at all times, there is room for 30+ yachts. This Facility has a dock and basic services ashore (pull back moorings for approx 6 yachts stern to, dinghy space on the back of the pontoon, a BBQ, bar, outdoor shower, toilets, fresh water &amp; lawn), however use of these are only possible when the owners are in residence. A trial clearance facility was established here during June 2013 (see news item adjacent). It is hoped that clearance will be possible here in the season (Jun-Nov) from 2014.
