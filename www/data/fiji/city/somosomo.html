<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Somosomo lies on the north west coast of Taveuni. The <span>Somosomo Strait, which runs between Taveuni Island and Vanua Levu, is one of Fiji's best known dive destinations. </span></span></p>
<p><span>As the third largest island in Fiji, Taveuni is know as the Garden Island and <span>has nature reserves harbouring an abundance of native plants and wildlife.</span></span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is NOT a Port of Entry.</p>
<p>When coming from abroad, the closest port of entry is in Savusavu on Vanua Levu. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities"><b>Noonsite/Fiji/Clearance</b></a>.</p>
<p>If coming from another Fijian port, only a cruising permit is needed.</p>
<p>Only in Somosomo is it expected to do 'sevusevu' because the paramount chief of Taveuni resides there.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The anchorage in Somosomo is suitable in prevailing Easterlies. During Northerlies a better anchorage can be found behind the barrier reef with the small islets just North of Matei.</span></p>
<p>There is a rough concrete pier used by inter-island ferries in Waiyevo.</p>
