<div class="hello"><div><p>The leading lights into Suva harbour are now blue (almost an electric blue), which  can be very difficult to see in poor visibility (something that is common in  Suva).</p>
<p>Position 18° 7'48.08"S, 178°23'57.29"E (Suva harbour)</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Refer to the main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities">Fiji Formalities</a></strong><span> page for detailed clearance information.</span></p>
<p>Most boats contact Suva Port Control on Channel 16 on arrival, who immediately  advise new arrivals to contact the Royal Suva Yacht Club (RSYC), also on Channel  16. Be patient calling the club on the VHF as the radio is situated in the bar  area of the club.</p>
<p><span>All vessels arriving in Suva Harbour are requested by Suva Port Control to anchor in the quarantine area <span>on the offshore (which is close to the RSYC marina)</span> for Customs clearance. Note, that <span>harbour security in this area is the responsibility of the water police and not of RSYC. </span></span></p>
<p>The RSYC will arrange for the various agencies to visit the  boat,  but at times there may be several hours delay. Crew must not come ashore until  cleared. The C<span>lub's rescue boat will transport  the officers to clear any waiting yacht(s) in the quarantine area.</span></p>
<p>All the paperwork is currently taken care of on board - including payment of  fees.  It is no longer necessary to go into town to pay the health clearance  fee. The club only charges  F$60 for all the transport fees (including boat &amp; boatman charges and taxis)  instead of the F$115 it previously cost using the port authority pilot boat.</p>
<p>There are two daily clearance times: Mon - Fri 0900 hrs &amp; 1500 hrs. Yachts  arriving after 1500hrs on Fridays will have to wait until the next normal  working day, or agree to pay the extra charges from these government departments  to clear outside normal working hours. <i>Currently cruisers report that the  authorities appear quite happy to delay clearance until normal working hours, but do take a dim view of crew coming onshore before being cleared.</i></p>
<p>Yachts arriving at the weekend at Suva have been fined in the past for not  notifying the authorities and anchoring at the yacht club until Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Cruising Permit</strong><br/> This permit is <strong>only</strong> issued after having cleared in. The permit is free but you must make your own way to the iTaukei Affairs Board which is in the Great Council of Chiefs Complex in the Government complex at 87, Queen Elizabeth Drive, Suva. This road is an extension of Victoria Parade (shown on city centre maps). It is about 3 km walk to the government buildings and you need to enter the huge complex at the first entrance which will take you along the side of the building. Then take the first door on your right and someone will direct you. If you ask for the Great Council of Chiefs building, taxi drivers and bus drivers will know what you want.</p>
<p>A permit to visit the Lau group is now automatically included in the cruising  permit.</p>
<p>Coastal Clearance is required for all yachts before leaving Suva harbour. You need to visit Customs to get this, and you should leave within 24 hrs of it  being granted. The office is not open at the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of June 2012 yachts are now issued with Customs Coastal  Clearance only once, and this covers all cruising within Fiji waters (provided you have your cruising permit from the I Taukei  Affairs Board). It is no longer necessary to clear in and out of  each Customs region visited, (Suva: Levuka: Savusavu: Lautoka: Lau Group:  Rotuma:).</p>
<p>There is however a requirement to report your position and current cruising  plans once a week. This can easily be done by:<br/> - VHF Ch:16<br/> - Telephone: 324 3782/3747/3315<br/> - Customs Hotline: 324 3666<br/> - E-mail: <a href="mailto:yachtsreport@frca.org.fj">yachtsreport@frca.org.fj</a></p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>The Royal Suva Yacht Club, located in Korovou, in the northern outskirts of the  city, is welcoming and has expanded its docking facilities to cater for the  increasing number of visitors. The club charges F$50 per night for an alongside  berth, when available. There is approximately 2 metres of water at the refueling  dock at high water, the bottom is soft mud.</p>
<p>Currently there are no moorings, you either anchor or go into the marina.  Holding in the anchorage area near the yacht club is patchy, and anchors do get snagged on debris on the bottom. A trip line is recommended. Cruisers report  that during a southerly change, the anchorage is not a particularly safe haven,  with a commercial anchorage just upwind of where the yachts are moored.</p>
<p><span>There is a charge of F$15 per person per month for using the dinghy </span><span>dock at the marina if you are anchored in the bay.</span><br/><span>Many free services are included like free fresh water, showers,</span><br/><span>rubbish disposal etc.</span></p>
<p>An alternative anchorage with limited docking is off the nearby Tradewinds Hotel  which is also used as a refuge during cyclones. This hotel however is now under  new ownership, so it is recommended to seek permission before anchoring here.</p>
<p>Tony Philps maintains several moorings (big white buoys) in front of his house &amp;  own yacht. Those moorings are put freely at the disposition of passing cruisers  after paying him a courtesy visit. This protected bay offers a perfect anchorage  if one stays a long time in the area (no smells from the public discharge,  relatively unpolluted water and calm anchorage).</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br/>A robbery (dinghy and outboard) was reported at the anchorage off the RSYC in June 2014. The same boat was broken into on the hard at MISEL a week later. It should be noted that <span>harbour security in the anchorage off the Yacht Club is the responsibility of the Port Police and not of RSYC. <span>However, the Club have requested that the Fiji Port Police do patrol the waters outside the marina, mainly after 22h00.</span></span></p>
