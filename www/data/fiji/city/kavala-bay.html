<div class="hello"><div><p>This deeply inset bay offers great protection from all winds except N-NW (although even with a moderate Northerly the anchorage is protected by a shallow reef).</p>
<p>The anchorage is just off the village of <span> Solota Vui</span> next to the concrete wall of the village store. Here you can land your dinghy and walk to the store (basics, bread, frozen meat, ice cream, gas, diesel, kerosene), to the village to do <i>sevu sevu</i> with the Elders, or to a beautiful 40 meter waterfall with pool.</p>
<p><span>Jo, a local here, can advise on the best anchoring spot and supply fruit and vegetables grown on his farm. He and his wife are very friendly and keen to get to know visiting sailors. </span></p>
<p><span>His farm is close to the anchorage where he has a modern washing machine which visiting yachts can use. His</span><span> main-house in the village, is yellow and close to the church.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The Chief here is reported to be very welcoming and prefer rice or sugar instead of Cava (which he does not drink).</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>On top of a hill a Vodafone tower is going up which will mean improved internet here.</span></p>
