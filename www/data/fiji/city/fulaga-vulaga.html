<div class="hello"><div><p>This beautiful island consists of an oval rim of jungle-covered hills of raised coral, around a lagoon about 6 miles by 5 miles. There is one 50m-wide pass into the lagoon, straight but challenging and dangerous in bad weather or strong tides. Inside the lagoon are countless mushroom islets, and some larger islands.</p>
<p>The population of about 400 reside in three villages, one, Naivindamu, is on the western shore, inside the lagoon, and the other two outside, on the southern side.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are countless anchorages over white sand, usually &lt;10m deep. At least one anchorage could be considered hurricane shelter.</p>
<p>Very rarely visited by yachts.</p>
<p><span>The village on the Island of Fulaga  requests a $50 anchoring fee which is used to help upgrading facilities on the whole island. This is in addition to the customary 1/2 kg of Kava for Sevusevu. See comment below.</span></p>
