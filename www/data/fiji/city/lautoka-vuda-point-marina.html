<div class="hello"><div><p>Ensure you fly the 'Q' flag and call <span>Vuda Marina on VHF channel 16 (07:30-15:00 Mon-Fri) when an hour away.</span></p>
<p><span><img class="image-right" src="Countries/copy2_of_VudaMarina.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Refer to the main </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Fiji?rc=Formalities">Fiji Formalities</a></strong><span> page for detailed clearance information.</span></p>
<p>Vuda Point Marina is now a Clearance station for arriving yachts (see photo).</p>
<p><span>Pickup the yellow quarantine mooring buoy ( approximately 400m outside the channel entrance). If the mooring is already taken by another vessel, then drop anchor nearby. The depth in this area is approximately 16m.</span></p>
<p><span>Call the marina again to advise them you are awaiting clearance. Monitor VHF channel 16 and await instructions.</span> See this <a href="http://www.vudamarina.com.fj/yachting/customs-clearance/"><b>Vuda Marina Clearance</b></a> page for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the marina charge a clearance fee of $60.00 apart from other official clearance fees.</p>
<p><span>If arrival is outside the marina's clearance hours (8am to 4pm Mon-Fri), then everyone MUST remain on board and</span><span> berth at Lautoka Wharf and clear in through the Lautoka offices there</span></p>
<p><span><b>I</b>t is no longer necessary to clear in and out of  each Customs region visited, (Suva: Levuka: Savusavu: Lautoka: Lau Group:  Rotuma:). Yachts can now clear out of the port of entry with a permit to cruise  all Fijian coastal waters within the bounds of their cruising permit. There is  however a requirement to report your position and current cruising plans once a  week. This can easily be done by:</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span style="text-align: center; "><span>Vuda marina is a</span>ccessible through a reef channel 25m wide, the marina entrance is marked with beacons and green leading lights and is easily arrived at by approaching the highly visable British Petroleum storage tanks from the south west.</span></p>
<p>It is not recommended that a night entry is attempted unless familiar with the approach. It is possible to anchor outside the channel but i<span>f there is a swell, then it may be more comfortable to take shelter at Saweni Beach for the night which is just North of the marina.</span></p>
<p><span>Lautoka Wharf is about 7nm NE of the marina entrance channel.</span></p>
