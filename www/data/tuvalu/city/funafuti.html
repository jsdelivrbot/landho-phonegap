<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Funafuti</b><span> is the capital of Tuvalu and the largest lagoon.</span></p>
<p><span><span> The South East pass is reported to be straightforward, although treat with caution in a strong SE wind.  Follow charted lines for ship channel right into Fongafale, these seem to avoid all shallow patches.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span>The North pass is much shallower and most likely be difficult in a northerly swell or strong northerly winds. Some sources recommend against using the North pass.</p>
<p>The West pass is reported to be easy provided there is good light.</p></div></div>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>For details see <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Tuvalu?rc=Formalities"><strong>Tuvalu/Clearance</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span>To clear in first go to the 3 storey government building and check in with Immigration. Quarantine is in the same building. Customs is at the end of the warehouse at the new ship wharf. You will need to use your dinghy to get around.</span></p>
<p>Remember that n<span>o clearance is possible from 16:00 on Fridays until Monday morning. Even if you arrive a few minutes after 16:00 on a Friday, you will have to stay on board over the weekend until you can clear at 09:00 Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><span>Clearing out is also simple and straightforward. If wishing to visit any outer atolls after clearing out, this must be requested in advance. In that case, you will be given a letter granting permission when you leave.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Anchoring is free in front of the town. There are t<span>wo anchorages here: one straight off the 3 storey government building at the South end of town (boats have reported good holding and easy dinghy ride in); the other about half way between there and the new ship wharf North of town (very good holding but longer dinghy ride).</span></p>
<p><span><span> There is an all-tide small dinghy dock off the Government building with good access to town (but use a stern anchor). Also a very good dinghy landing on the South side of the new ship wharf, next to the police boat dock.</span></span></p>
<p>For the Marine Park you need a permit from the Council. This us understood to cost $50 but it is unclear for how long it is valid.</p>
<p>Latest reports are that boats that have anchored elsewhere in the lagoon, outside the park, did not need to pay any fees. However it is worth checking about possible anchoring charges with officials on arrival.</p>
