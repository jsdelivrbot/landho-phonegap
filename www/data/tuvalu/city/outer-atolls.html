<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Nukefetau Atoll</b></p>
<p>This atoll lies about 85nm NNW of <span>Funafuti. Enter the lagoon through the </span><span>Teafua Pass. On arrival present your letter from Customs at the Police station. There are several good, procted anchorages, depending on the wind, but none give great protections at high water when the wind is from the west.</span></p>
<p>There is Internet at the government station at the telecom building. You can take your laptop and the cost is approximately $5/hour.</p>
<p>There is a bank where you can change money, but no ATM machine.</p>
<p>There are several small shops with basic staple foods but if the supply ship is due (or late) then the shelves are likely to be bare.</p>
<p><b>Nanumea Atoll</b></p>
<p>This welcoming and friendly atoll is 200nm NW of Nukefetau. There is a well marked, but narrow channel through the reef. Beware of the strong tidal flow. It is likely that the Police will paddle out to ask for your Customs letter and to welcome you to the atoll.</p>
<p>The anchorage is calm and well sheltered by the island and the reef.</p>
<p>Internet is available in the telecom building at approximately $5/hour. It is possible to use your own laptop.</p>
<p>There is no ATM, however can exchange money at the bank.</p>
<p>Gas(petrol) is available from some local stores.</p>
<p>There are a lot of small stores with basic supplies only.</p>
<p>Added as a new port April 2013.</p></div></div>
