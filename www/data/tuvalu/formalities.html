<div><p>It is important that yachts <strong>do not stop</strong> at any of the other islands before clearing in (or out) at Funafuti. If you do so, even for an emergency, you might face difficulties with the police in Funafuti.</p>
<p>Flying the Q flag, anchor for clearance near the wharf, where Customs are located. The Customs officials may deal with everything in their office, or may want to come out to the yacht. If this is the case, the officials must be ferried in the yacht's own dinghy.</p>
<p>No clearance is possible from 16:00 on Fridays until Monday morning.</p>
<p>For details of anchoring in the lagoon, see Funafuti.</p>
<p><span>Current policy (June 2013) is that all yachts MUST return to Funafuti for final outward clearance, and yachts are not allowed to stop at any of the outer islands after making final outward clearance.</span></p>
<p>In the past it was possible to request permission to visit some of the other islands, however this concession has been abused by some yachts and it is no longer possible.</p>
<p>There is a departure tax of $30/person.</p>
