<div class="hello"><div><p>This is an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p>See <a href="Countries/StLucia?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Noonsite/StLucia/Clearance</strong></a> for the details.</p>
<p>The Customs officers can be found down by the container terminal<span>.</span> While Immigration officers can often only be found at the airport. Clearance may be completed during office hours on weekdays only; at weekends it is necessary to clear at Hewannora Airport.</p>
<p>Clearance here often involves delays and may well require a wait overnight. This is not a safe port for overnighting following the death of a British cruiser in January 2014 who was trying to defend his wife from armed boarders. See<strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/saint-lucia-vieux-fort-british-skipper-dies-in-armed-robbery/"> report.</a></strong></p>
<p>This port is best avoided. Use <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/Soufriere">Soufriere</a></strong> instead.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><i><b>Daytime break-ins were reported here in 2011 and again in 2012 from yachts at anchor. Armed boarders attacked a cruising couple overnighting here on their yacht resulting in the death of the British skipper. It is advisable to avoid using this port.</b></i></p>
<p>Vieux Fort has anchorages off the town’s commercial ship dock,  or beside the Fisheries Complex.</p>
<p>Yachts can also anchor in the newly built "small craft port", some 2 cable lengths NW of the commercial dock, behind a massive wave breaker. While landing the dinghy has always been the biggest difficulty, this little harbour has solved the problem.</p>
<p>The port is protected by security, and is only 1 minute walking distance from the centre of the town.</p>
<p>There is also an anchorage in the SE corner of the bay.</p>
<p><i><b>It is not yet clear if the couple attacked here in January 2014 were berthed in the small craft port or were lying at anchor.</b></i></p>
