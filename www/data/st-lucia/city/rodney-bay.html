<div class="hello"><div><p>Rodney Bay is situated on the north west coast of Saint Lucia and is a popular holiday and yachting centre. It is also the home of the ARC Finish Line and always very crowded with yachts in December.</p>
<p><span>Position 14°04′44"N, 60°57'22"W (marina/harbour entrance)</span></p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Thefts of locked dinghies and outboards from yachts anchored off Reduit Beach continue to be reported here. Be sure to "lift it and lock it, or risk losing it". Petty theft from boats in the marina and lagoon seems also to be on the increase. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="General/Piracy">Piracy Reports </a></strong>for further details. As of January 2015 the marina have introduced new security protocols. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/igy-rodney-bay-marina-responds-to-negative-security-reports-on-the-island/">Report by IGY Marinas.</a></strong></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/StLucia?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><b>Noonsite/StLucia/Clearance</b></a> for the details.</p>
<p>The marina request that yachts tie up alongside the Customs dock in the marina on arrival, which is marked by yellow posts. However, this rule is not enforced and boats tend to dock wherever they can find a space.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor outside the marina if arriving in the dark or in difficult conditions.</p>
<p>On arrival, the captain must report immediately to the Customs and Immigration office inside the marina, open 08:00-12:00, 13:00-16:30 every day including Sunday, except Friday when it is open until 18:00.</p>
<p>The crew must not disembark until formalities have been completed. There is no docking charge if only coming to clear.</p>
<p>If a visa-on-arrival is required, then a taxi trip across the island to the international airport in Vieux Fort (1 hour) is necessary.</p>
<p>The channel leading into Rodney Bay Marina has a maximum reported depth of 13 ft (4 m).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Rodney Bay is the yachting centre of Saint Lucia. The bay is over a mile long with a man-made causeway at its Northern end that connects Pigeon Island to the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Bay Marina</strong></p>
<p>Within the bay is a large, completely protected inner lagoon, accessed via a narrow channel. This lagoon - known as Rodney Bay Marina - is dredged to 13ft (4 metres) in the main channel and at the main docks, so yachts with a very deep draft should proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Rodney Bay Marina is an official port of entry and also the ARCs (Atlantic Rally for Cruisers) Caribbean home. It has the island’s only boatyard for pleasure craft with haulout facilities for yachts up to 75 tons. The boatyard is part of the same organisation as the Marina with a range of workshops and repair services.</p>
<p>The marina is a "five star" facility. Yachts are encouraged to contact Rodney Bay Marina on VHF prior to entering the channel, to get information on possible obstacles on the approach and to arrange for a slip.</p>
<p>Do not connect to water or electricity points before visiting the marina office. (Marina primarily 220V electricity with 110V at selected docks. - transformers provided if required.</p>
<p>Rodney Bay can now offer mooring buoys in the lagoon next to the marina. They provide a tender service to the dock between 0830-1630. Contact RBM@igymarinas.com or Tel: +1 758 572 7200.</p>
<p><strong>Waterside Landings </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This is a mini-marina inside the lagoon with around 15 alongside and stern to berths (slips).</p>
<p><strong>The Landings</strong></p>
<p>This resort with private marina is located closer to Pigeon Island and has 17 slips for rent by hotel guests.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring </strong></p>
<p>If you’re planning to anchor out at Reduit Beach, Gros Islet or Pigeon Point, the Marina is the most convenient port of entry into Saint Lucia. If anchoring here, as mentioned above, be sure to haul your dinghy and outboard out of the water and lock them to the boat at night. There is very limited or no anchoring possible in the lagoon.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Thefts of locked dinghies and outboards from yachts anchored off Reduit Beach have been reported here. Be sure to "lift it and lock it, or risk losing it". Petty theft from boats in the marina and lagoon seems also to be on the increase. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/RodneyBay/General/Piracy">Piracy Reports </a></strong>for further details. As of January 2015 the marina have introduced new security protocols. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/igy-rodney-bay-marina-responds-to-negative-security-reports-on-the-island/">IGY Marinas Report.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>There is a VHF Morning Net for Cruisers</strong><strong> here on Ch. 68 at 0830. Great for security info., taxi shares to the airport, local info. and advice etc.</strong></p>
