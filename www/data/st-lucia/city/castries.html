<div class="hello"><div><p>See <a href="Countries/StLucia?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Noonsite/StLucia/Clearance</strong></a> for the details.</p>
<p>Whilst <span>Castries Harbour does have Customs officials, it is a commercial port and not geared towards yachts. Therefore it is easier to clear through Rodney Bay or Marigot. </span></p>
<p><span>Customs and Immigration officials are available during office hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Officials insist that yachts entering the harbour come directly to the Customs’ dock (if there is no room, anchor east of the Customs buoy). It is wise not to ignore this directive as a fine could be incurred.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Yachts can anchor in front of Castries Town or in Vigie Creek. See comments at bottom of page from cruisers who have tried anchoring off Castries town - the bottom is reported to be very foul.</span></p>
<p><b>Vigie Creek (near GFL Charles Airport) </b><br/>The facilities at Vigie are somewhat run down but basic yacht repair and replenishment facilities may be available. There is little space here however for anchoring <span>and it can be rolly in northerly swells.</span></p>
<p><b>Castries Harbour</b><br/>The main advantage of the Harbour anchorage is its close proximity to the capital of St Lucia. Note that there may be up to 5 cruise ships in port and anchoring may not be suitable during busy cruise ship periods.</p>
<p>When entering Castries Harbour, it is necessary to avoid the shoal that extends to the west of Tapion Peak. Vigie Hill has a light that flashes twice every 10 seconds, allowing you to easily identify the harbour at night.</p>
