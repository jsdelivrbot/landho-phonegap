<div class="hello"><div><p>Soufriere is a small, rustic, picturesque town, set amid a scenic wonderland dominated by the towering Pitons. When approaching Soufriere Bay from the North, beware of the shoal which extends out from the South side of Anse Chastanet.</p>
<p><span>Position 13°51′N, 61°04′W (bay entrance)</span></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Noonsite has received reports from cruisers who have had their boats burgled while out at dinner and have been boarded and burgled during the night, when moored on mooring balls at the Bat Caves in Soufriere. You may want to speak with the locals about hiring a watchman to keep an eye on things while you are ashore, and remember to secure all hatches and doors when ashore or asleep.</p>
<p>Efforts by the Saint Lucia Police Force to improve security for yachts on the west coast seems to be having an effect, and the situation here appears to be improving in 2016 (see comments at bottom of page by Chris Doyle).</p>
<p><span>Also in Soufriere, in March 2016, cruisers were 'mugged' at the Hummingbird Resort dock when returning back from dinner to board their dinghy to go back to the boat. See </span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/StLucia/saint-lucia-soufriere-hummingbird-dock-armed-assault-robbery-march-2016">this report</a></b><span> for details.</span></p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The whole area between Anse Cochon and Gros Piton is part of the Soufriere Marine Management Area (SMMA) and anchoring is strictly controlled to preserve the underwater coral reefs.</p>

<p><b>Moorings</b></p>
<p>Moorings have been laid down in Anse Chastanet, just north of Soufrière Bay, off the Hummingbird Beach Resort north of Soufrière town,  Malgretout just south of Soufriere and between the Pitons. <span>Although the mooring systems are well maintained by the SMMA, as indicated by a yellow tag on the pick-up line, make sure your buoy is holding the vessel as intended, and that the system is secure.</span></p>
<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>In 2016 t<span>he marine park has had some management and finance problems and quite a few moorings have been lost. Locals have put down their own moorings to accomodate visiting yachts, but they are nothing to do with the</span><span> SMMA and the moorings are of unknown quality/too close together. All the private moorings are right off Soufriere town, If a vendor approaches you to put you on a mooring say you want to be on an SMMA mooring not a private one. Only give him the tie up fee.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Fees</b></span></p>
<p><span>The use of the moorings requires a Coral Conservation Permit. </span>The <strong>cost of the permit</strong> depends on vessel size and length of stay and must be purchased from a uniformed SMMA Ranger. Call SMMA on VHF channel 16 if in doubt.</p>
<p>Permit fees can be found at <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.smma.org.lc/fee/">http://www.smma.org.lc/fee/</a></b></p>
<p>There is also a fee of US$2 per person/per day.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring is forbidden within the SMMA, except in the designated areas for which a permit is required. </strong>Anchoring is only permitted during daytime hours of 06:00 to 18:00. Due to the depth, it is necessary to tie off the stern of your boat to a palm tree.</p>
<p>Authorised members of the Soufrière Water Taxi Association will help tie stern lines and are available for all water transfer services. Rates are standard and they also provide watchman services when boat owners are ashore.</p>
