<div class="hello"><div><p>Marigot Bay is located mid-way along the NW coast of Saint Lucia. It lies approximately 3.4 miles to the SSW of Castries Harbour. <span>It is a small inlet almost completely invisible from the sea until you are almost upon it. </span></p>
<p>James A Michener, the US Novelist, is famously quoted as describing it as "The Most Beautiful Bay in the Caribbean", it is also a historic landmark having played a roll in a number of battles between the French and Royal Navy. <span>Legend has it that a British admiral hid his fleet from the French here by tucking themselves inside the bay and tying palm fronds to their masts to camoflage them.</span></p>
<p>It is famed as the setting for the 1967 film version of Hugh Lofting's classic Doctor Dolittle books, which starred Rex Harrison and Anthony Newley. The bay is used for the scenes involving the shipwreck, the fictional Great Pink Sea Snail and the construction of the harness for the Giant Lunar Moth.</p>
<p>Consequently, Marigot is the most visited bay on St. Lucia and popular with tourists, excursion boats and yachts alike.</p>
<p>When watching for the entrance, keep an eye open for the prominent house with the bright red roof on the cliff top at the southern entrance. The channel is lit with port and starboard markers  (IALA B - American buoyage system – red right returning).</p>
<p><span>Position 13°58.1′N, 61°01.8′W (harbour entrance)</span></p>
<p><strong>Security<br/></strong><span>A report was received in October 2014 from a boat that was burgled at night here (unlocked). Be sure to secure all hatches and doors when going ashore or asleep.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Marigot Harbour is a completely sheltered anchorage and one of the best hurricane holes in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/>It is possible to anchor in the outer bay outside of the channel near the entrance to the bay. T<span>he outer anchorage can be busy with numerous tourist boats and hotel guests in sailing dinghies. It can also get very crowded with yachts anchoring, so a watch is recommended.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Marina &amp; Mooring Buoys</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The marina and resort located in Marigot's inner bay were taken over by Capella Hotels and Resorts in 2013. Hurricane season berthing is offered and the marina promotes itself as an exclusive superyacht facility.</span></p>
<p>Mooring buoys are provided by the marina in the inner bay. The nightly charge does include use of the hotel facilities, which are very nice, although prices are not cheap. Pay at the marina office once you are tied up.</p>
<p>It is likely a number of small boats will approach you as you enter offering to help with mooring. One of these may well be from the marina mooring field in the inner bay. Others may be touting unofficial mooring balls, so take care.</p>
