<div><ul>
<li>Saint Lucia is part of the Windward Islands and a good base from which to explore the rest of the Lesser Antilles.</li>
<li>Cruising attractions include excellent facilities at Rodney Bay Marina in the north and in the well-protected port of the capital Castries, the scenic anchorage of Soufrière Bay overlooked by The Grand and Petit Pitons and the delightful, yet crowded, landlocked harbour of Marigot Bay.</li>
<li>The government has actively encouraged the establishment of yachting related businesses, aiming to make Saint Lucia one of the prime yachting centres in the Caribbean.</li>
<li>Getting work done here: Rodney Bay has a well-service boatyard. Good electrical, mechanical and electronic contractors, several of whom work as service agents for major manufacturers. Note that the Christmas period is a busy time with plenty of public holidays, so it's advisable to schedule work outside of this time.</li>
<li>Provisioning: Reasonable value for money. Many imported US products. Fresh produce markets in main towns and supermarkets near all ports.</li>

<div><p>Although boardings and theft from yachts in the Caribbean is not unusual, Saint Lucia does suffer its fair share of incidents. C<span>heck the Noonsite </span><a href="General/Piracy"><strong>Piracy Pages</strong></a><span> for latest reports received.</span></p>
<p>Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night. This includes securing all hatches and doors and stowing anything of value out of sight. <span>Cruisers have reported purse snatching attempts in broad daylight in the past.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If heading to </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Soufriere/">Soufriere</a></strong><span> to see the Pitons and Bat Caves, note that night boardings and burglaries have been reported here, and it's strongly recommended to lock up at night and employ a watchman if going ashore. The situation does appear to be improving here in 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Also in Soufriere, in March 2016, cruisers were 'mugged' at the Hummingbird Resort dock when returning back from dinner to board their dinghy to go back to the boat. See <b><a class="external-link" href="saint-lucia-soufriere-hummingbird-dock-armed-assault-robbery-march-2016">this report</a></b> for details.</span></p>
<p>Daytime burglaries were reported in 2011 and in 2012 by cruisers leaving their boats at anchor in<strong> Vieux Fort </strong>while travelling to the airport to check-in with immigration and/or collect guests from arriving flights. It is recommended that a crew member be left onboard at all times. Sadly, a British cruiser was killed defending his wife against armed boarders in Vieux Fort in January 2014. <strong><a class="external-link" href="saint-lucia-vieux-fort-british-skipper-dies-in-armed-robbery/">See report</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This<strong> <a class="external-link" href="caribbean-saint-lucia-police-report-improved-yacht-security">news report</a></strong> indicates that efforts are being made by the Saint Lucia Police Force to improve security for yachts on the west coast.</p>
<p>Dinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean and on this Island are particularly active in the Reduit Beach area, Rodney Bay. Best advice is to place your dinghy on deck and chain it overnight.</p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net</strong> (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com"><strong>safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</strong></a>) provides information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have suffered a boarding, robbery or attack on your yacht or have information about a yachting-related security incident, go to the <a href="https://www.safetyandsecuritynet.com/submit-report-google-forms-draft/"><strong>CSSN homepage</strong></a> and click on the "Report an Incident" icon. The associated form is quick and simple to complete and ensures that all the necessary details are reported. The CSSN is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors. Remember, it is every cruiser's responsibility to ensure that incidents are reported. <strong>Also</strong> cruisers can subscribe to e-mail alerts, follow on facebook and twitter and listen to the SSB Voice Service.</p>
<p><strong>The Caribbean Security Index (CSI)</strong> is a a tool to assist cruisers in assessing the probability of crime at ports and anchorages throughout the Caribbean. The CSI provides a means of assessing risk in a given area.<br/><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/">http://freecruisingguides.com/caribbean-security-index/</a></strong></p>
