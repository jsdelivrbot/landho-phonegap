<div><p>East Caribbean dollar (EC$). US$ also widely accepted.</p>
<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit and credit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p></div>

<p>Main Radio stations in Saint Lucia:</p>
<p>Radio Saint Lucia: 97.73 &amp; 97.9 Mhz<br/> Helen Radio: 100.1 mhz<br/> Caribbean Hot FM: 96.1 &amp; 105.3 Mhz<br/> The Wave: 93.7 &amp; 94.5 Mhz<br/> Joy FM: 90.1 &amp; 96.9 Mhz (Christian Radio Station)</p>
<p>The prepaid SIM card for St Lucia is a practical option for using your existing world phone as a prepaid St Lucia cell phone while you’re in the country at a better rate than you’d pay for a St Lucia cell phone rental.  The SIM chip, combined with an unlocked GSM World cell phone, helps you keep the lines of communication open without being burdened by high international roaming surcharges applicable when you use your “home” SIM card abroad. You’ll likewise enjoy the benefit of SMS text messaging, voicemail, a local cell phone number in St Lucia, and FREE incoming calls.</p>
<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/><span>Anyone cruising using Digicel should be aware that if you purchase a SIM card in one country, it cannot be topped up in different one, as previously possible. So if you wish to use the sim bought here while cruising in other countries, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or set up an account and do it online.</span><br/><span>You can top-up Digicel at </span><a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p></div>

<p>Friday Seafood Feast - Anse la Raye<br/> Only 10 minutes away from Marigot Bay, this fishing village offers an excellent Friday Night fish feast. Starting from 6pm, tables are set up in the middle of the street overlooking the bay, while cooking is done in booths that line the two sides of the road. There is lobster in season and a variety of seafood, barbecued, fried or cooked en papillote. There is music and occasionally live band entertainment.</p>
<p>Street Party - Gros Islet<br/> The original street lime. Gros Islet Friday Night on Friday evenings has been in existence for over 20 years. Barbecue grills come out onto the sidewalks and glowing coals sizzle beneath chicken and conch kebabs. All the bars down Gros Islet's main street are a hive of activity with visitors and St.Lucians. Speakers set up on street corners keep the audience hopping with a variety of Caribbean rythmns. Go in a group and don't take your wallet.</p></div>
