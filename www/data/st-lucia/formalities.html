Users previously registered with the old eSeaClear system will find all their details have been carried over to the new system.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also possible to complete arrival paperwork at the Customs and Immigration offices (i.e. filling out paper forms in quadruplicate as in the old days). This is a slow process however and using SailClear will enable a much faster clearance.</span></p>
<p>On arrival the captain should go ashore to report to Customs. The crew must remain on board until clearance is completed. Customs clearance from last port is required and a local declaration form must be completed in quadruplicate (including animals, duty-free goods, firearms on board).</p>
<p>If staying less than three days, one can clear in and out on arrival. After clearing out, yachts have 72 hours to depart Saint Lucia, or 24 hours if local or charter boats.</p>
<p>Yachts must clear out with Customs and Immigration. A new crew list must be submitted if there have been any crew changes.</p>
<p>If a boat is leaving with the same crew, it may do so without clearing out provided its stop is less than 72 hours, but this must be made clear when clearing in. Any boat must leave within 24 hours of having cleared out.</p>
<p>Duty-free fuel may be purchased after clearing out. This is best done at Rodney Bay Marina where one can go directly to the fuel dock after clearing Customs.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Daytime burglaries have occurred in Vieux Fort while skippers travel to the airport to deal with Immigration. It is therefore recommended not to check-in here if you have to leave the boat unattended.</p>
