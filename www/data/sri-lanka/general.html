<p>The prepaid SIM card for Sri Lanka is a practical option for using your existing world phone as a prepaid Sri Lanka cell phone while you’re in the country at a better rate than you’d pay for a Sri Lanka cell phone rental. It’s also a trouble-free ticket to using the same options that the Sri Lankans themselves use—the local Sri Lankan cell phone system. The SIM chip, combined with an unlocked GSM World cell phone, helps you keep the lines of communication open without being burdened by high international roaming surcharges applicable when you use your “home” SIM card abroad. Also enjoy the benefit of SMS text messaging, GPRS, voicemail, a local cell phone number in Sri Lanka, and FREE talk time for the first 30 seconds of all incoming calls. </p>
