            </h2>
<div><p><span>An agent is required to clear into and out of Sri Lanka.</span></p>
<p><span>Preferably establish contact with an agent before arrival so they can arrange for your permission to enter the harbour. </span></p>
<p><span>See </span><a href="Countries/SriLanka/?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents"><strong>Sri Lanka/Clearance Agents</strong></a><span> for a list of agents. Whilst agents must charge as per a government price tarif, there are still price differences between the different agents, so ask for several quotes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Emailing the agent in advance with the following details may save you time hanging around waiting: </span><i>Yacht Name, LOA, beam, draft, flag, port of registry and registration number. Name of Master, Masters Passport No., Last Port, Departure Date. No. of Crew and crew details, including nationality and passport numbers. If anyone is flying out of Sri Lanka list them as passengers and not crew.</i></span></p>
<p><span><b>Clearance Procedure on Arrival </b></span></p>
<p><span>Clearance must be carried out through this agent, both on arrival and departure. The agent is supposed to ensure that the captain complies with port and immigration regulations, that he has sufficient funds in foreign exchange for the fees and that all port dues and customs duties are settled before departure.</span></p>
<p><span><span>It is recommended that you call your chosen agent on VHF about half an hour out (before calling Port Control), and again as you get closer. They will contact the officials to meet you on arrival.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Arriving yachts must also call the Port Authority on VHF Channel 16 when approx. 1.5NM off, to notify them of arrival.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>A Port Authority official will come out to the boat during office hours (08:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00 Monday to Friday) to fill in an arrival report (yacht details, crew list, etc.). The agent appointed will come to the yacht. Usually the agent will bring the health officer for the quarantine inspection, who</span><span> will board the yacht and inspect it before granting pratique. Then the yacht will be inspected by a Customs officer, who will require the last port clearance. Crew lists and details of any passengers or crew who are leaving the vessel have to be given to Immigration.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Expect to be boarded by Health control, Immigration, Customs and Port Security. <span>Be aware that these officials may ask for "gifts" after having searched the boat. Do not be intimidated into doing so, if you do not wish it.</span></span></span></p>
<p>The port authority will indicate the area in each port where yachts may anchor. Yachts should not move from their original mooring without the Harbour Master's permission. Permission is also needed before hauling out a yacht. Land the dinghy at the appointed places in each port.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong><br/> On departure a clearance certificate must be obtained from Customs. If the yacht is sailing along the coast, a clearance certificate must be obtained for calling at other ports in Sri Lanka. Access is only permitted to official ports of entry.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Passports must be valid for at least 6 months on arrival.</p>
<p><strong>On-line visa application</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sri Lanka requires that you apply and be approved for a visa PRIOR to arrival. You apply for the visa on-line at <b><a href="http://www.eta.gov.lk/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.eta.gov.lk</span></a>,</b> and pay approximately $35 USD per person during the application process (by credit card).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Tourist visas are valid for 30 days and can only be extended for up to 6 months by going to the head Immigration Office in the capital city of Colombo.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you attempt to clear into Sri Lanka WITHOUT a pre-approved visa, you may be <span>asked to leave Sri Lanka waters immediately, or you may be charged</span><span> a significant fee to process you visa on demand. In January 2015 several yachts arrived without a visa and were charged $200 USD per person, no receipt provided, for a visa.</span></p>
<p>For more information, please visit the<strong> <a href="http://www.immigration.gov.lk">Immigration website</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sometimes, the online system gives out functional errors like refusing and locking credit cards etc. Therefore, if you can apply for your visa prior to arrival, immigration should go smoothly.</span></li>
<li><span>It is recommended to apply for a </span><span>Visitors Visa rather than a Transit Visa, because if you overstay your Transit Visa there are hefty fines to pay. </span></li>
<li><span>Be careful to enter all data on-line correctly (Name/passport number etc.) especially when entering the number 0 and letter O.</span><span> </span></li>
<p> </p>
<p>Any crew or passengers leaving the yacht in Sri Lanka must get a landing endorsement from Immigration or police before leaving the harbour. It is an offence for someone who is not a crew member, or no longer a crew member, to move ashore without a landing endorsement. Likewise, the master may not engage any crew while in Sri Lanka without permission from Immigration or police. A new crew list should be given to the police if there are any crew changes.</p>

<p>All electrical and electronic goods such as cameras or radios must be re-exported.</p>
<p>Customs permission has to be obtained for any item that is taken off or put on board the yacht, including ship's stores and items being repaired. In Galle the Customs at the harbour gate will often check the contents of any bags carried.</p>
<p>Yachts may stay up to two months.</p>

<div><p><strong>Port dues:</strong> US$200 for the first month or part thereof, which must be paid on arrival. $175 for subsequent months. Payment made at one port is valid for other ports. US$20 customs fee. Overtime clearance fee (approximately US$10).</p>
<p><i>Above fee includes agent fee, but excludes costs of visas. </i></p>
<p>On-line visa application: US$30 per person</p>
<p>Customs charges i<span>f the yacht departs after 24 hours: 2400 LKR (US$25 including tips).</span></p>
<p>No overtime fees apply as all formalities are completed within normal working hours.</p>
<p><strong><i>A note about Agency fees:</i></strong><br/>All agencies must charge as per <span>the tariff issued by the government, which has not changed since 2008. This is as follows:<br/></span></p>
<p><span>1)<span> </span></span><span>The first 10 days or part thereof: 100USD<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>
<p><span>2)<span> </span></span><span>Thereafter for each additional 10 days or part thereof: 50USD<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>
<p><span>3)<span> </span></span><span>If one stays for 30 days, agent must be paid: 200USD<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>
<p><span>4)<span> </span></span><span>SLPA charges for 30 days: 100 USD</span></p>
<p><span><span>Be sure to get a quote from your potential agent PRIOR to visiting Sri Lanka. You should ask for an itemized list of ALL government and agent fees which will be incurred during your estimated stay in Sri Lanka. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Some agencies request or require that you pay them for their services prior to arrival via electronic funds transfer (EFT bank transfer). Y<span>ou may however want to seriously consider paying your agent in local currency or US dollars, with a paid receipt in return. If you do accept the EFT option, be sure to clarify who is going to pay the bank fees prior to transferring the funds.</span></span></span></span></p>
