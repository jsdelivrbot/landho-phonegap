<div class="hello"><div><p>Arriving yachts should contact the port authority on VHF Channel 16 before proceeding into the harbour.</p>
<p>Yachts are treated on the same lines as commercial shipping; it is not recommended to use Colombo, but if it is necessary to go there, it may be advisable to use an agent.</p>
<p>A naval security inspection will be carried out before entering the harbour. Clearance is done with Customs, Immigration and Health.</p>
