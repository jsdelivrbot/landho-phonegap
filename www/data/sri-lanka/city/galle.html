<div class="hello"><div><p>Galle is a small town on the south western tip of Sri Lanka and a Port of Entry.</p>
<p><span>Whilst the harbour is dusty, noisy and quite dirty, the old Dutch Town part of the city is beautiful, and worth visiting.</span></p>
<p><span>During the civil war that dragged on from 1986 to 2009, this "tourist" harbour was considered the only safe place for visting cruising yachts to clear into the country, however now <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SriLanka/trincomalee">Trincomalee</a></strong> on the NE coast is also considered a safe port for clearance.</span></p>
<p><span>Mirissa, just SE of Galle, is the largest fishing port on the south coast of Sri Lanka, but also has a small marina that welcomes visiting yachts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Position 6° 02"N, 80° 13"E </span></span></p></div></div>

                Clearance
                
                
            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>To enter Galle, you must use an Agent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SriLanka?rc=Formalities"><strong>Sri Lanka Formalities</strong></a></strong> for full details on clearance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See </strong><strong><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/SriLanka?rc=Formalities#ClearanceAgents">Sri Lanka Agents</a></b></strong><strong> for a list of available agents.</strong></p>
<p><span>It is recommended that you call your chosen agent on VHF about half an hour out (before calling Port Control), and again as you get closer. They will contact the officials to meet you in the bay.</span></p>
<p><strong>Arrival in Galle</strong></p>
<p>Your arrival should be timed for daylight as entering the harbour at night is prohibited. Yachts arriving after 18:00 or at night should anchor behind Watering Point, which is a much calmer spot to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.</p>
<p>Arriving yachts must also call the Port Authority on VHF Channel 16, approx. 1.5NM outside the inner harbour, to notify them of arrival. If you have not yet appointed an agent, they will organise military clearance and recommend an agent for you to use.</p>
<p><span>They will ask you to anchor outside the pier (a</span><span>nchor near the yellow buoys opposite the entrance and allow room for ships to manoeuvre in and out)</span><span>, to wait for the Navy who will look at your passports and escort you to a place where you can moor and meet up with your agent to finalise the paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span>The harbour has a boom across the entrance with a narrow channel around the southern end. The navy will either direct you to go on the pontoon near the entrance (stern or bow-to with an anchor out) or anchor fore and aft in the inner part of the harbour.</span></p>
<p>Be aware that officials here may ask for "gifts" after having searched the boat. Do not be intimidated into doing so, if you do not wish it. There is a notice at the Port entrance stating the it is an offence to offer, receive or request any bribe.<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>After the clearance procedure is finished you can move the boat to another position in the harbour as long as the harbour master approves.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note: In case of Emergency</strong>, the captain can come ashore and contact Customs and Immigration at the gate and inform the Port Authority of arrival. The captain can also appoint an agent whilst ashore.</p>

<p><span>The facilities for yachts here are currently not very impressive, it is dusty, dirty and quite noisy</span><span>. Cruisers report that the port, although protected, suffers from surge. It is also a long walk around to the main gate of the port and quite a distance into the beautiful old town centre. The cost for the  5-10 minute tuktuk-ride however is only 1 USD.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mooring Options</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The good news is that a new marina is under construction here, located immediately south of the New Pier behind the floating pontoon close to the port gate (<i>photo courtesy of Tango Shipping</i>). Expected to open September 2015 this new facility will be very welcome and hopefully improve conditions here for visiting yachts.</span></p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="resolveuid/9868b651ae2a445a9d817dc5355d9e2f/@@images/image/preview"/><span> </span>Mooring is only permitted in the inner harbour (mooring buoys elsewhere have been removed).</p>
<p>On the North side of the NE extension of Gibbert Island there <span>are two old "lego" pontoons for yachts. The inner one is closest to the gate and the shower, but has no shore connection. Neither of them have electricity or water. </span>Berthing is stern-to, using your own bow anchor. The swell can be bad here and the pontoons are very wobbly. <span> There is limited room on the inside and minor protection from the open sea. In addition, these pontoons are situated next door to <span> docks where bulk cement is unloaded all day. It is therefore very dirty.</span></span></p>
<p>The inner harbour consists of the Fisheries Quay (in the north), where berthing is restricted to fisherman only.</p>
<p>The middle commercial pier has berthing available on its north side for yachts - rafted two out. Two places next to the shore are reserved for vessels belonging to the port. When there are no commercial ships, yachts may moor on the south side of this pier. Remember, these piers are designed for ships, they are big and concrete and dirty. Use lots of fenders.</p>
<p>The Closenburg Pier (in the south) provides mooring for yachts on the north side only when there are no commercial ships.</p>
<p>Anchoring is possible between Closenburg Pier and the middle pier.</p>
<p>There are mooring buoys between the new quay and the fishing harbour and this is the best place to leave a yacht during the SW monsoon. Use plenty of mooring lines as well as an anchor to ensure the safety of the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>
<p><span>The authorities have provided a toilet block for yachts (now under repair). It is not permitted to take water from here by jerry can. If water is required, you should contact your agent who can organise a delivery. A minimum of 1 metric ton of water can be organised (1 metric ton of water = 8USD).</span></p>
<p>Electricity is not available at all piers, only those close to shore (e.g. the middle pier). This must be requested via your agent, who can also arrange for extension leads and connection.</p>
<p>Fuel can be carried inside the port by jerry can or delivered by your chosen agent.</p>
<p><span>Cruisers are expected to pay for rubbish disposal (often called the junkman) when disposing of hazardous items like oil, batteries etc. Your agent can advise on how to organise this.</span></p>
<p>The port is guarded by port security, there is one gate with a checkpoint. A port pass is required for entering and leaving the port, received when clearing in. Taxis/tuktuks are not allowed to pass the checkpoint. The tuktuk drivers can be very helpful if you are trying to source something.</p>

      These pontoons were installed in 2013 and offer space for up to 20 boats. They are the first pontoons as you enter the harbour. The harbour is open 24/7 but is busiest between 0600-1000 when the fishing boats return, the whale watchers leave and the fish market opens (a 5 minute walk from the pontoons). Water &amp; electricity and locked gate. Repair services available.
