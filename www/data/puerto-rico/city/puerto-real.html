<div class="hello"><div><p>Although this is not an official Port of Entry, it is possible to berth here first and then contact the CBP office in <span>Mayagnez. They will either request the whole crew to go to their office in <span>Mayagnez (the marina can help arrange transport) or the officials</span></span><span> will visit the boat.</span></p>
<p>If the boat is part of the Local Boaters Scheme, then just a phone call might be all that is required.</p>
