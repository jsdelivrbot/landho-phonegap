<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying north of Vieques (the other island in the group known as the Spanish Virgin Islands), Culebra lies equidistant between the main island of Puerto Rico and western-most island of the British Virgin Islands, Charlotte Amalie.</p>
<p>Culebra is a popular weekend tourist destination, especially known for its crystal clear water. <span>There is a small cruising community who live there year round. Vieques to the south is even quieter than Culebra.</span></p>
<p>Many of the small islands around Isla Culebra are nature reserves and restrictions must be observed.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>Ensenada Honda is very well protected by its reef, and is about a mile and a half long. It has several quiet coves with a reasonable depth of water and good holding.</span></p>
<p><span>Boats entering Ensenada Honda (Big Harbour) can proceed to the head and anchor in sand just west of Cayo Pirata.</span></p>
<p><span>A particulary good anchorage is just inside the Western reef at the </span><span>entrance to Ensenada Honda where the national park authority has laid good </span><span>free-to-use moorings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Dinghies can be left at the town dock which is west of the Dinghy Dock Restaurant.</span></span></p>
