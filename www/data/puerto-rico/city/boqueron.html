<div class="hello"><div><p>Boqueron, on the south western coast of Puerto Rico, is a good protected anchorage. The village is full of narrow alleys with brightly painted houses.</p>
<p>In the summer it is a popular resort town, however, it is frequented almost year round by locals wanting to party, especially Thursday through Saturday, when the college crowd from Mayaguez and San German descend on the area. The music can be loud, which may make you want to choose an alternative anchorage.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This is not an official Port of Entry.</p>
<p>It may be possible to anchor at Boquerón and take a taxi into Mayaguez to clear in. Some US boats that already had $25 customs decals have managed to clear in by telephone from Boquerón.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>This anchorage offers good holding in 12-20 feet and is well protected from all winds except SSW through NW.</p>
<p>There are two entry points into Boqueron Bay: Canal Sur to the south, and Canal Norte to the north. A flashing green light marks the deeper southern (Canal Sur) passage, and once you have cleared this, you can proceed into Boqueron Bay.</p>
<p>There is a dinghy dock here. Most facilities are available (laundromat, small grocery store, propane refill). The Club Nautico no longer has fuel, but it's possible to beach your dinghy just south of the marina and walk across the road to the gas station to get your diesel.</p>
