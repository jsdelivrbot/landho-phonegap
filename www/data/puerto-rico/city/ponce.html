<div class="hello"><div><p>The Ponce Yacht &amp; Fishing Club is a private marina that has a few <span>slips for rental on a daily basis. IF you plan on renting a slip, you are permitted to use their </span><span>fuel dock for FREE for clearing in. Their weekly rates for rental work out better value than paying the daily rate. Facilities are good (see below).</span></p>
<p>If however you anchor, you must pay to use the fuel dock for clearance, which sometimes results in a 4 hour stay. During this time the club cannot sell fuel for the hours that the fuel dock is blocked and selling fuel to sport fishing boats is a significant profit center for the club. Therefore, the Club charges $25 for boats under 40 ft and $50 for boats over 40 ft to use the fuel dock for clearance only.</p>
<p>Note that refuse CANNOT BE DISPOSED of without express permission of the Department of Agriculture, which is part of the group that clears a boat in. If rubbish is taken off the boat prior to permission being granted, the boat is subject to a $5,000 fine and the club can be fined as well.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to anchor in the harbour, it has been reported that the PYFC no longer offer use of their facilities to anchored boats for a nominal daily fee (which used to be $10 per person, per day). It is therefore difficult to find a safe dinghy dock to leave your dinghy at when going ashore. See comment at bottom of the page.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage outside the marina and a place to land and leave a dinghy north of it by a ramp. This pontoon however is used by commercial vessels and cruisers do risk damage to their dinghy if leaving it here.</p>
<p>It costs US$10 by taxi to get into town where there is a good range of shops and a big <span>cash and carry. There is also Sams Club, Walmart, Homedepot and well known fashion outlets in town.</span></p>
