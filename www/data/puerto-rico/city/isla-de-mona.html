<div class="hello"><div><p>Mona (Spanish: <i>Isla de la Mona</i>) is the third-largest island of the Puerto Rican archipelago, after the main island of Puerto Rico and Vieques. It is the largest of three islands located in the Mona Passage, a strait between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the others being Monito Island and Desecheo Island.</p>
<p>It measures about 7 by 4 miles, and lies 41 miles west of Puerto Rico, of which it is administratively a part.</p>
<p>The island is a nature reserve and, though there are no native inhabitants, rangers from the island's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources reside on the island to manage visitors and take part in research projects.</p>
<p><span>An ideal place to stop if on passage between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. </span></p></div></div>
