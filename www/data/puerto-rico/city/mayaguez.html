<div class="hello"><div><p>Mayaguez is an easy landfall from the Mona Passage, and after clearing it is an easy passage south to Boqueron and onward. It is the largest port on the west coast - it is commercial, but a convenient port of entry.</p>
<p>Position 18°12’N, 67°07’W.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Go to the commercial dock and phone Customs or clear at the Customs office on the main street.</p>
<p>It is possible to anchor just south of the Customs/ferry wharf at the head of the harbour and dinghy in. Be prepared for wash from the DR ferry (long lines) however an early morning arrival solves this problem.</p>
<p>Instead of entering the commercial port, it may be possible to anchor at Boquerón and take a taxi into Mayaguez to clear in or to berth at the new marina at Puerto Real.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that all the crew has to attend the Immigration office.</p>
<p>For US boats that are registered in the LBO (Local Boaters Option) then a telephone call should be all that is required.</p>
