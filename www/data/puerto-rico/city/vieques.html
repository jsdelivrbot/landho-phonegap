<div class="hello"><div><p>The island of Vieques (part of the Spanish Virgin Islands) is still relatively undeveloped and many think it represents the Caribbean of 30 years ago. For 50 years it was under the control of the US Navy and so was not developed as were the other islands.</p>
<p><span>The eastern end of the island is "off-limits", due to its past use for target practice by the US Navy and thousands of unexploded pieces of ordnance lying around.</span></p>
<p>There are two small towns;  Isabel (where the ferries dock), and Esperanza. The latter being an attractive beach front village.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful anchorages and dive spots, with crystal clear water and pristine white sand beaches.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Avoid eating any fish caught off Vieques as local opinion is that most fish have <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579736/">Ciguatera</a></strong> (January 2014).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are no public moorings here, anchoring only. The usual anchorage for cruisers is at Puerto Real Bay, in Esperanza, on the south coast of Vieques.</p>
<p>There is a public dinghy dock at the eastern end of this anchorage. Private moorings are available here from time to time, but it is best to check with local knowledge upon arrival in Esperanza.</p>
<p>Fuel and water are available but need to be transported to the boat by dinghy.</p>
<p>WiFi is available but consult with a local for location of the best reception.</p>
<p>Note: there is a "Yacht Club" shown on the tourist maps, but this is really just a collection of tourist shops.</p>
<p>The main town of Isabel Segunda is on the north coast and is more commercialized.  It is the site of the inter island ferry terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Anchorages</strong></p>
<p>There is a beautiful beach at Sun Bay and a phosphorescent bay just to the east of Esperanza. There is an excellent hurricane hole at Ensenada Honda, which also serves as a good place to explore the countless fingers of healthy mangrove inlets and islands. The water here however is murky and to avoid the insects, anchor far enough out to pick up the breeze.</p>
<p>If anchoring off the south or southeast shores, cruisers are advised not to venture beyond the immediate shore area as the post-Navy Departure clean up is still in progress and unexploded ordinances are a real danger.</p>

<p><strong><i>Security:</i></strong> There have been several cases of dinghy theft reported in Esperanza and cruisers should be extra-vigilent with dinghy security. In November 2015 there were<span> two separate incidents of theft from anchored boats as was posted in Vieques Cruisers group. In June 2016 a locked yacht anchored off <span> Isabel Segunda was burgled (see report adjacent).</span></span></p>
