<div class="hello"><div><p>This provides a well-protected anchorage in a lagoon, the entrance to which is sheltered by mangrove swamps. The anchorage bottom is mainly mud and sand. Holding is mediocre.</p>
<p>Security in the anchorage is good and at the marina.</p>
<p>Dinghies can be landed at the marina in the transient dinghy area. Also, there is a dinghy dock available at the Waterfront Bar and Restaurant called Sal Pa’ Dentro, which is just west of the marina.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
