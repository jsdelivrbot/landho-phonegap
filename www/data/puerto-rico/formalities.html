<div><p>All visitors, except US citizens, require a valid passport.</p>
<p>Entry requirements for non-US citzens are as for the US. This requires a personal visit to the Immigration office for all the non-US crew.</p>
<p>For US citizens, there is a Local Boater Programme (LBP) in Puerto Rico which allows participants to report by phone instead of in person to the nearest CBP office.</p>
<p>See Noonsite's <strong><a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Immigration">USA/Immigration</a> </strong>page for more details on US Immigration requirements.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the visa-waiver program <strong>does not apply</strong> to visitors arriving by yacht <strong>for the first time</strong>, and all non-US crew, except Canadians, require a visa in advance.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Members/val/R2012-04-03-3"><strong>Accurate Information for Yachtsmen Entering the USA</strong></a></p>
<p>A multiple entry visa should be requested, especially if cruising from the US Virgin Islands or other US territory.</p>
<p><span>An alternative method on entry for crew without visas is to make use of the Visa Waiver Program (if they are eligable) by first taking a ferry trip from the BVI's to the USVI's. This has been confirmed as perfectly legal and will then allow crew to enter the USVI again or Puerto Rico by yacht. It is, however, essential that they are in </span><span>possession of a valid ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). Once granted, an ESTA is valid for 2 years. Entry under the VWP permits visits of up to 90 days from the date of the first entry into US territory.</span></p>

<p>Check with Customs at your Port of Entry whether it is necessary for you to check in with Customs again when moving from one Customs area to another within Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>US boats are permitted to retain any firearms on boat if they have been previously registered with ATF before leaving the mainland US.</p>
<p>Any firearms on a foreign-flagged boat will be retained unless the owner has a permit and this has been approved by Customs prior to arrival. See <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/USA/?rc=Formalities#Customs"><strong>USA/Customs</strong></a> for the necessary details.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local Boater Option</span></strong><br/> The US department of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  has implemented the Local Boater Option (LBO) program. This option is available to frequent small boat users in the Tampa, Miami, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands areas. The LBO will allow CBP to expedite the arrival reporting process to low risk boaters.</p>
<p>Enrollment to the LBO Program is voluntary, free of charge and will facilitate your clearance procedures.  All US citizen are eligible to join. In order to participate in the LBO you must contact CBP at the nearest registration location designated by the Port of Entry. The applicant will be provided an appointment to present all required documentation to CBP Officials.</p>

<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Puerto Rico is an area of interest with thousands of reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p>
