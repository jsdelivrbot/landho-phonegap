<p>Most banks and bank machines accept most international credit cards.  These are welcomed almost everywhere, the best known is Visa.</p>
<p>There are many banks and cash machines in Guadeloupe. Foreign cheques are not generally accepted.</p>
<p>Effective 1 July 2015, the I cent and 2 cent EC coins will be withdrawn from circulation. The coins will no longer be valid either as  consumers will not be able to conduct transactions using these coins. Persons can present the coins at any of the commercial banks which operate within the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to receive face value.</p>
<p>A price rounding system will be implemented within the ECCU countries for the settlement of cash transactions only, whereby the total payment, inclusive of duties, fees and taxes, will be rounded symmetrically to the nearest five cents. Non-cash payments using cheques, debit andcredit cards will not be impacted and therefore will not be rounded.</p></div>

<p>Internet service is available through a local server, Caribsurf, run by the phone company.  Internet Access is available at all hotels on Guadeloupe, and at several other locations:</p>
<p>Cell phone coverage is available everywhere on Guadeloupe, but  check with your cellular service provider to be sure they offer international coverage and that your cell phone supports service from the caribbean - you'll also want to be aware of your carrier's rates as calls from Guadeloupe (or to you while you are on Guadeloupe) may very likely be at a higher rate.

<p><strong>Digicel update December 2014:</strong><br/><span>Anyone cruising using Digicel should be aware that if you purchase a SIM card in one country, it cannot be topped up in different one, as previously possible. So if you wish to use the sim bought here while cruising in other countries, you should either put on a large enough sum to cover your needs, or set up an account and do it online.</span><br/><span>You can top-up Digicel at </span><a dir="ltr" href="https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://online-top-up.digicelgroup.com/</a></p></div>
