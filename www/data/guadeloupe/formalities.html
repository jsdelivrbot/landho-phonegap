<p>All other nationalities require visas, which should be obtained from a French embassy or consulate in advance. Ensure that the visa given is valid for Guadeloupe.</p>

<p>Guadeloupe is a French Department, therefore the health care system is excellent. Unlike most tropical regions, there are almost no communicable diseases or those transmitted by parasites. There are no poisonous or dangerous animals, except as noted below.  Other good advice:</p>
<p>Don't spend time under a Manchineel tree (similar to an apple tree). It has caustic and mildly poisonous sap. Don't touch the leaves or eat the fruits. The juices burn the skin. The main island of the Guadeloupe archipelago is cleared of most of these trees, but there are still plenty of them on the Saintes and on Saint-Bart - very often marked with warning signs.</p>
<p>Some fish, especially around the northern islands eat poisoned seaweed which can lead to severe food poisoning in humans.</p>
<p>Swimming in some rivers is dangerous because of Bilharziosis (a parasitic disease). Normally there are warning signs.</p>
<p>Beware of the Scolopendra (millepede with a shell). Its sting is similar to that of a scorpion.</p>
<p>Be aware of stray dogs at the beaches, because they can transmit worms. Wear your sandals to the beach and use a mat.</p>
<p>Some mosquitos transmit the Dengue virus and Zika virus.  Sleep under a mosquito net even while in your yacht and wear mosquito repellant always.</p>
<p><strong>ZIKA VIRUS ALERT: (September 2016) </strong><span>There have been recent safety alerts from the US State Department, UK Foreign Office, and Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding travel to parts of Central and South America, Africa, southern Asia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific islands. Guadeloupe is an area of interest with multiple reported cases and active virus transmission. There is growing concern about the rapid spread of the ZIKA Virus and the impact of the virus on pregnant women and babies. ZIKA is transmitted by mosquitos in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and there is currently no cure or vaccine. This situation is evolving rapidly, so please refer to </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/">the CDC’s dedicated website</a><span> if you are intending to cruise in one of the effected areas.</span></p></div>

<div><p>Cats and dogs over three months old may be admitted temporarily with a bilingual veterinary certificate, which includes proof of anti-rabies inoculation at least 30 days prior to entry and proof of deworming for tapeworm 10 days or less prior to arrival. Dogs and cats must also be identified by a microchip that meets ISO standard 11784, which is the 15 digit transponder operating at 134.2 kHz.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>You may find that officials do not ask to see any documentation for your pet. However cruisers who have visited the French Islands with pets advise the following:</p>
<p>Make sure your dog's vaccinations and rabies documentation are current, get an International Health Certificate from your local vet prior to traveling, have an international microchip and keep invoices for products such as flea/tick/heartworm treatments. It is quite possible the officials in the French Islands will not question you or care about your pet. However, if they do, you can have a local vet provide the documentation required if something is missing from your records.</p>
