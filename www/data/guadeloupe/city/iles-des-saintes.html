<div class="hello"><div><p>Located 10km S of Guadeloupe, this picturesque group consists of two main islands, Terre-de-Haut and Terre-de-Bas, and seven smaller ones.</p>
<p>There are about 3,000 inhabitants, split between the two main islands. There is just one doctor, and his home, on Terre-de-Haut, resembles a ship's prow and is something of a local landmark.</p>

            </h2>
<div class="hello"><div><p>Clearance is no longer carried out at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Everything is done upstairs at the internet cafe (turn right off the main dock look upstairs on your right). It is calle "Les Saintes Multiservices" (LMS). Clearing in costs 2 Euros. Cruisers have reported staying 5 days and being able to clear in and out at the same time. It is also possible to leave laundry here.</p>
<p><span>The mooring fees can also paid here or will be collected by the LMS dinghy from your boat.</span></p>
<p><span>If wishing to pick up a mooring buoy <span>off <span>Bourg des Saintes</span> to enable you to clear in, arrive as early in the day as possible as they are likely to be fully occupied by midday</span> and anchoring, even for a short time, is not permitted. The officials are reported to be quite aggressive about enforcing this.</span></p>

<p><span>It is compulsory to use the new moorings unless they are all occupied, when it is then </span><span>permissible </span><span>to anchor.  However, anchoring is only allowed in certain areas, not all of which are suitable (too deep) or sheltered.</span></p>
<p><span>It is advisable to arrive as early in the day as possible as most mooring are occupied by midday.</span></p>
<p>Moorings have been installed in several anchorages:-</p>
<ul>
<li><span>In the harbour at Bourg des Saintes</span></li>
<li><span>On Terre D’en Haut, and</span></li>
<li><span>At the anchorage to the southwest of Ilet a Cabrit.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Pain de Sucre</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Prices depend on the size of the yacht and fees should be paid to les saintes Multiservices (LMS).</p>
<p><span>Fees are approximately 13 Euros per day; 60 Euros per week.</span></p>
<p>There are at present, no moorings at Anse Fideling on Terre D’en Bas.</p>
<p>Garbage can be collected for 2 Euro/day.</p>
<p>The LMS dinghy can deliver fresh bread from the barkery at 8am every morning.</p>
<p>Cruisers report this anchorage to be uncomfortable. See comments at bottom of page.</p>
