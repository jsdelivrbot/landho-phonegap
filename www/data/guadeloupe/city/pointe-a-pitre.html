<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two hurricane holes; Port de Plaisance and Riviere Salee. The passage north through the River Salee is tricky but do-able in daylight and good conditions if your draft is less than two metres.</p>
<p><b>However, the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.marinaguadeloupe.com/index.php/en/the-marina/river-bridges">Bridges of the River Salee</a> are closed until further notice due to maintenance.</b></p>
<p>The yachting services here are some of the best in the Leeward Islands and they are experienced in dealing with many types of yachts. The marina site has many bars and eateries with free Wifi.</p>
