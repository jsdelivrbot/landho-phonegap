<div class="hello"><div><p><span>The marina is approx. a mile south of the town. </span><span>Whilst it does not have space to accommodate catamarans, there is a pontoon at the entrance to the marina reserved for visiting yachts, which usually has space for a few nights. There is also a good fuel dock.</span></p>
<p>It is possible to anchor just north of the entrance. The holding here is good, but take care to remain on the shallower bank as the water around it is very deep.</p>
<p><span>Around the marina is a bakery, butcher, vegetable shop, small chandlery, mini-mart as well as a plethora of bars. There is a nice little beach behind the marina. A half hour walk along the promenade takes you into town with larger supermarkets for full provisioning.</span></p>
