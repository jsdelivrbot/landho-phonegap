<div class="hello"><div><p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/Pelican_clearance_Zanshin_sized.jpg/@@images/image/preview"/>Anchoring here is more difficult now that new mooring buoys have been laid. Once secure, dinghy ashore for clearance.</p>
<p>Th dinghy dock is in the middle of the main town strip.  Much more convenient than the old location up the small river.</p>
<p>The store "Le Pelican"  has a computer with which to clear in or out at a cost of 4 Euros. It is a brightly coloured building <span>located on the ocean side of the main street about halfway between the dock and the dinghy tie-up at the riverside; only about 50 meters from either.</span> (S<i>ee picture provided by Arnd of SV Zanshin</i>).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The breakwater here is 90m long, and T-shaped. The maximum draught is 1.5m.</p>
<p>More and more of the French Caribbean islands are trying to provide moorings to start preserving the sea bed for turtles and other marine life. Lots of new mooring buoys have been laid in Deshaies by the EU, which now means there is very little space left for anchoring. That said, latest reports are that the buoys are available to use for free. The moorings close to the shore are meant for smaller boats, those further out for larger vessels.</p>
<p>There is reported to be excellent WiFi out in the mooring field from Le Pelican and HotHotHot.</p>
<p><span>Talk to the dive shop on the dock if you need to take on water. There is also reported to be a tap near the tennis courts (see comment below by SY Calico Jack). </span></p>
<p>At Anse Deshayes there is a useful mooring for boats continuing North.</p>
