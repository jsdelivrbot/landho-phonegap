Inward clearance is likely to take some hours even though all the necessary papers would have have to have been received at least 72 hours earlier (courtecy of Mr Vladimir Ivankiv see <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Russia/?rc=Formalities#Clearance">Russia/Clearance</a> ). On departure, the proceedure is quicker.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The city is connected to the coast via a 22NM long sea canal from Baltiysk. A one-way system is in operation with east bound vessels leaving 0300-0400 and 1500-1600LT and west bound at 0800-1100 and 2000-2300LT.</p>
<p>When making for the Kaliningrad yacht harbour, allow 4 hours from the Passport Control office. Parts of the approach are very shallow, although the bottom is very soft mud.</p>
<p>There is a yacht harbour at Baltiysk, but it is not known if foreign yachts may use it.</p></div></div>

      Moor bows-to in 2.5m. No real facilities or services, although the Harbour Master and his staff are very helpful and do their best. Very few visiting yachts, so everyone very friendly. The city centre is about 10km away.
