<div class="hello"><div><p>The 36 mile long shipping channel is through the Kronstadt Passage and Morskoy Canal.</p>
<p>St Petersburg Radio can be contacted on VHF Channel 16 and 71, or on 2182 kHz.  Port Control on VHF Channels 16, 09, 67 or 20.</p>
<p>According to regulations, when a vessel reaches buoy 19 in the approach channel, it should ask to be met by a pilot to be accompanied to the Customs dock. At the moment, yachts clear at the passenger terminal, where there is a Customs office. The terminal is located on the Korabelny Channel. After formalities are completed, yachts are directed to one of the yacht clubs.</p>
<p>Changes in the rules now permit yachts to clear in at Fort Konstantine at Kronstadt instead of the cruise terminal.</p>

      Trickiest access due to shallow water and minimal buoyage. Bp prior arrangement the Club will send out a launch to guide you through the shallow approach. With strong East winds the maximum depth is only 2.5 metres, but the deep water difficult to find. Mooring is bows-on to a pontoon from buoys (some of which are about 30m from the pontoon so need long warps). Water, electricity, restaurant and bar, chandlery, crane, 24 hour guard. Winter storage.
