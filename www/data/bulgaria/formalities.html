<div><p>Clearance must be completed with Customs, Health, Immigration and Port Authority. Officials will usually visit the yacht on arrival and the crew must remain on board until formalities are completed. The formalities are not complicated, but passports and ship's papers may be retained until departure.</p>
<p>Standard documentation such as ships registration papers, insurance certificate and crew list and valid passports are required. A ships stamp is very helpful, not that there are many documents to be stamped in Bulgaria, but forms do have a place to stamp.</p>
<p>A certificate (Form A) will be issued at the first Port of Entry, valid for 6 months, and each section signed by the relevent officials. First Health officials, next the Border Police, then Customs and, finally, the Maritime Administration Office.<br/> If there are no changes to skipper or crew, then Form B will not be needed.</p>
<p>Yachts are no longer required to check in/out of each port once clearance has been completed.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong><br/> On departure from Bulgaria, Complete Form C and then follow the departure procedure at the Maritime Administration office and the Customs office. After which the form can then be authorised by the Border Police.</p>
<p>Port Control in the smaller harbours do not respond often on VHF 16.</p>

<div><p><!--think this is no more....The Harbourmaster issues a Clearance document "Sailing Permission" on exit from Bulgaria to a foreign port. The fee for this document is 25 Euros for vessels under 12m (as per registration) and 50 Euros for vessels over 12m. There still seems to be confusion between ports on the requirement of having a "Temporary Navigation Certificate". If you enter in Balchik, the Harbour-master will issue a "Temporary Navigation Certificate" at a cost of 30 Euros, this is valid for the entire coast of Bulgaria. Neither Varna nor Bourgas use this system.!--></p>
<p>All Bulgaria Ports of Entry follow the same procedure. The Certificate issued on entry to Bulgaria (see <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Bulgaria/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><b>Clearance</b></a> above) is valid for six months, as long as the yacht does not leave Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The officials here expect the skipper to be able to produce a "Certificate of Competance".</p></div>

<div><p>There are no restrictions on where you can go, but cruisers have commented that the local border Police in each town are obviously observant, because the minute you dock or come ashore by dinghy they will ask to see your passport. They record you in their "little black book", smile, and wish you a pleasant stay in Bulgaria.</p>
