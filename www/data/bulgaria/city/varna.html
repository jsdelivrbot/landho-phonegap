<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very pleasant city on the western shores of the Black Sea, about 60nm north of Burgas, even though it is one of the largest ports on the Bulgarian coast. The pedestrian area of town runs for miles in all different directions and it would be very easy to spend weeks touring the sites of Varna, as there is so much to see.</p>

<p>Call Port Control on VHF on approach.</p>
<p>No one should either leave or visit the boat until clearance is completed. All the appropriate officials will visit the boat at the Yacht Club and the paperwork completed onboard. Reports are that this is very speedily done. There are no fees payable.</p>
<p>Call Port Control to advise of departure.</p>
