<div class="hello"><div><p>Lying at the westernmost point of the Black Sea, Burgas is Bulgaria's largest port. It hold several international festivals during the summer and has a vibrant student population which adds to its atmosphere. The town has a cosmopolitan feel, however facilities for visiting yachts are limited. </p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry. See <a href="Countries/Bulgaria/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><b>Bulgaria Formalities</b></a> for details.</p>
<p>Call the Port Authorities on VHF channel 11 on approach. Moor at Quay 6 for clearance. The formalities are performed here and are straightforward. The ships papers may be retained by the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>The Port Control Office is situated on the 8th. floor of the tower with the radar antenna, by the dock gates. (NOTE: No lift after 3rd floor!). You must go here for departure clearance.</p>
<p>After clearance, a yacht can move to the yacht club.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The Yacht Club is immediately to starboard after passing the lighthouse at the entrance to the commercial harbour.</p>
<p>In 2006 cruisers report that the moorings are in a poor state and generally for smaller yachts (no more than 12m). It may be  advisable to drop your own anchor and back to the quay, but stand well off as wash from passing commercial traffic and swell can cause problems. There is 24 hour security.</p>
<p>It is quite a long walk into town from here with little shade.</p>
<p>There is an anchorage behind the commercial port. A few local boats moor here and it offers good shelter. The bottom is mud and good holding. You are closer to town and you do not have to walk through the port.</p>
<p>There is a dinghy ramp near the light on the end of the breakwater.</p>
