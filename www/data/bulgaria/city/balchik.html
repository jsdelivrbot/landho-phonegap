<div class="hello"><div><p>This port is the most northerly port in Bulgaria and the best port to clear in if coming from Romania. </p>
<p>When coming from the North (Romania) you will be called on VHF channel 16 by the Bulgarian border control authority when rounding Nos Kaliakra, requesting pertinent info. about boat and crew. They will also notify the border authorities in Balchik by telephone. </p>
<p>Approach from the East is straightforward with a breakwater clearly visible. </p>
<p>When coming from the South there is a permanent long fishing net set up a little to the West of the harbour entrance, with no lights. </p>
<p>The Town of Balchik becomes a busy seaside resort in the summer months. Its steep cobbled streets, Queen Mary's Palace and the botanical gardens all add to its interest as a port of call. There are many restaurants and bars and easy provisioning. </p>
<p>Position 43°24.0’N, 28° 09.8’E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Port of Entry. See <a href="Countries/Bulgaria/?rc=Formalities#Clearance"><strong>Bulgaria Formalities</strong></a> for further details.</p>
<p>If this is you first port of entry in Bulgaria you will need to complete entry procedures. The officials will call on VHF Ch16 when entering the harbour and direct you to the commercial dock. This is a huge concrete wall approximately 8 feet high, not ideal for berthing, however the officials are reported to be friendly and patient and will assist with mooring lines.</p>
<p>Clearance is straight forward; one form is to be completed and a crew list. The officials will then take these documents and passports to their office and return with them duly stamped. The completed form becomes the cruising permit for all of Bulgaria, to be surrendered when clearing out.</p>
<p>After completing the clearance procedure proceed to the inner harbour (old fishing harbour).</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The protection in Balchik harbour is very good.</p>
<p>The inner harbour gives good protection for all weather conditions and winds from all directions. This harbour has been converted to a marina with floating finger pontoons.  Depths vary and it is as shallow as 2.5 meters in some places, however at the pontoons the depth is 3.5m.</p>
<p>The pontoons are suitable for yachts up to 12m. While longer yachts can use them in fair weather, in strong northerly winds it might be safer to try and find a berth alongside if available.</p>
<p>Facilities are limited, but water and electricity are available on the pontoons and there are shower and laundry facilities nearby. Berthing charges remain at 2 Euros a metre, including water and electricity.</p>
<p>Note that the docks are public and there is no security. In the summer months the inner harbour is a popular place to stroll for locals and tourists alike.</p>
