<div class="hello"><div><p>The ancient town of Nessebar (an UNESCO World Heritage Site) is sometimes referred to as Bulgaria's Dubrovnik. It lies at the southern end of a big bay, with Sveti Vlas at its northern end.</p>
<p>Approach with care, shallows with scattered rocks extend some distance around the old town shoreline. Keep well to the South when approaching the breakwater from the North or East. A small marker buoy indicates the extent of the shallows to the South. </p>
<p>The old town is located on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a causeway. It consists of rebuilt churches, some dating back to the 5th century, cobblestone streets flanked by souvenir shops of every kind, and restaurants and bars. </p>
<p>It is a very popular tourist town and the crowds come to enjoy both the ancient buildings and remains, as well as one of the best beaches in Bulgaria. It is on the cruise ship itinerary and best seen on days when no cruise ships are in town.</p>
<p>Position 42° 39.2’N, 27° 43.7’E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are many possibilities for mooring. </p>
<p>The breakwater on the North side of the harbour may have room, but it is also used by the day tripper boats and you might be asked to move. Security is limited here. </p>
<p>To the North is the new Marina Nessebar with a floating breakwater pontoon offering protection from Southerly winds and waves. </p>
<p>To the West is Yacht's Port Marina with good shelter. </p>
<p><b>Anchorage</b><br>
It is possible to anchor in the harbour where there is good protection from all winds except Southerlies.</br></p>
<p>In Southerly winds anchor on the north side of the peninsula west of the fishing harbour. It is a sand/mud and weed bottom. Keep a careful eye out for isolated rocks when you are inside the 4m contour. </p>
<p>The town has banks, ATMs, internet cafes and easy provisioning.</p>
<p>It has been suggested by cruisers visiting in 2011 that Dinevi Marina in Sveti Vlas, 4 NM to the north of Nessebar, may be a better marina to leave your yacht if planning to travel inland.</p>
