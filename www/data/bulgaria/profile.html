<div><ul>
<li>Bulgaria is changing and there are no longer any restricted areas to visiting yachts. Once cleared in, there is no requirement to check in with any authorities at intermediate ports, except when clearing out again.</li>
<li>Officials are reported to be very friendly and helpful.</li>
<li>The best port to clear in coming from Turkey is Tzarevo, and coming from Romania is Balchik. Yachts can also clear-in at Varna and Burgas. Burgas is a large commercial harbour with limited facilities for private yachts, Sozopol would be a better place to stop.</li>
<li>The Bay of Burgas, between Sveti Vlas and Sozopol, is a real cruising ground where it is possible to find relatively isolated anchorages.</li>
<li>Great progress has been made developing facilities for cruisers with full service marinas in Sozopol and St. Vlas and finger pontoons in Balchik and Nesebar - all with water and electrical outlets and Wi-Fi.</li>
<li>On January 1 2007 Bulgaria joined the European Union.</li>
