<div class="hello"><div><p>Yachts are not allowed into the small harbour in the old walled city. Gruz Harbour, which is a commercial port, or Dubrovnik marina, in the Rijeka Dubrovacka, are the options available to visiting yachts.</p>
<p><i>Gruz</i> - Moor stern to and use your own anchor. Subject to surge from passing vessels.</p>
<p><i>Dubrovnik Marina</i> - Call the marina in advance (VHF channel 17), or wait at the entrance to be allocated a berth. Good shelter.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Once formalities are completed in Gruz, a nice place to anchor is outside the walled city, just a short hop around the bay from Gruz. Sometimes boats are asked for an anchoring fee here (4 euro/metre), however others have reported not having to pay anything.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>It is not permitted to land on <span>Lokrum Island before 09:15. Nor is it permitted to fasten mooring warps to the island.</span></p>

      The section of quay beyond the ferry berth is reserved for yachts and is designated a 'marina' and charged accordingly. Water and electricity. <br>
The advantage is that it is close to the town, but noise, dirt and tourists on the adjacent busy road are intrusive. Shops close by.<br>
See comment below about berthing in Gruz Harbour.
