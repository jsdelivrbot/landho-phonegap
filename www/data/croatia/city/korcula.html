<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Korcula Town</strong><br/> The usual berths here are in the ACI marina, which lies in a small cove, east of the town.  It is protected by a breakwater on the northern side. This is often full and it is worth reserving a berth in advance.</p>
<p>When the town marina is full, yachts are directed to the outside of the breakwater. This is exposed and it may be worth moving elsewhere.</p>
<p>An alternative is the quay near the Harbour Master's office, or on the west side of the town. Yachts that anchor in the bay near the town still get charged. In 2011 fees were approx. 40 Euros a night.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ports/Anchorages on Korcula Island</strong><br/> There are several more locations for mooring and anchoring around this attractive island:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor by the Missionary (42 57.1N 17 09.7E) for free. Dinghy about a mile to Korcula town.</li>
<li><i>Vela Luka</i> - on the northern end; a busy harbour with all facilities.</li>
<li><i>Brna</i> - in the middle of the south coast; a relaxing, quiet harbour with some facilities.</li>
<li><i>Zavalatica</i> - about 5nm E of Brna; a small harbour rapidly becoming a tourist centre. </li>
<li><i>Luka Racisce</i> - this little harbour is on the east side of the island, 5.5nm west of Korcula town. Some facilities.</li>
</ul>
