<div class="hello"><div><p>This attractive town is in one of the most sheltered natural harbours in the northern islands. It sits in the part of the island where it narrows.</p>
<p>The harbour can be entered from either the west coast or from the east, through the Prolaz Privlaka, an artificial canal. The canal is 3m deep and is spanned by a swing bridge which opens twice a day (9am and 6pm).</p>
<p>This long harbour has a fetch of about 3nm, so in northerly winds some berths can be unconfortable.</p>
<p>Berth in the marina, which is just south of the entrance to the canal.</p>
<p>Berth to one of the 3 long pontoons in SE end of the harbour. An early arrival is recommended as this is a popular stop for yachts.</p>
<p>It is also possible to berth to the quay SE of the ferry berth, but beware that this quay is very, very low and fendering can be a problem.</p>
<p>There is nowhere to anchor here.</p>
<p><strong>Susak</strong><br/> This small, green island lies just 6nm to the west of Mali Losinj. There is a good anchorage in the sheltered bay on its eastern side. The small port here has two grocery stores; the larger one being at the harbour. There is also a fish market and a post office. In addition, LPG is available.</p>
