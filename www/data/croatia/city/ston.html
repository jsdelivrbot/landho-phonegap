<div class="hello"><div><p>Located at the far end of the Stonski Kanal, at the southern end of the Peljesac peninsula and about 25NM NW of Dubrovnik, this charming medieval town is worth the detour to visit it. Very un-touristy with some striking architecture.</p>
<p>Position 42°50'N, 17°42.1'E.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>Information received in 2010 was that anchoring is permitted here, however, it is likely the harbour master will try to stop you doing so as the holding is very poor and constitutes a risk. Cruisers who have succesfully anchored here have not been charged as the harbour master will take no responsibility if there are problems.</p>
<p>In 2011, cruisers reported that the Port Captain &amp; police went so far as not to permit anchoring and were only allowing yachts to stay on the dock for a fee, or leave.  </p>
<p>Excellent shelter.</p>
<p>The Port Captain's office is in the centre of the town. He speaks German as well as Croatian. </p>
