<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a busy harbour, but easy to enter in all conditions.</p>
<p>There are several berthing options, however <strong>it is now forbidden to anchor anywhere in this harbour.</strong></p>
<p>For marina berths the large, sheltered ACI marina is a popular choice but that means arriving early afternoon and avoiding Friday and Saturdays during the summer to ensure getting a berth.</p>
<p>Various clubs also have berths here although prior arrangements might be advisable.</p>
<p>A quieter marina mooring may be found  at the PSD Zenta marina. Another alternative is the <span>luxurious Lav marina 3 miles east of Split.</span></p>
<p>There are two, more public, berthing spots in Split Harbour. One is at the quay just SE of the harbour office, and the other is the quay south of Diocletian's Palace. This one is free but very noisy.</p>
<p>The harbour is exposed to the S and SW and the constant movements of vessels causes surge, although the marina is protected from most of this.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="Countries/croatia-pics/SplitCroatia.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>Anchoring</strong><br/> Anchoring is now forbidden in this harbour, and yachts that do so face substantial fines and their boat papers being confiscated until payment is made.</p>
