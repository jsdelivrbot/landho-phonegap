<div class="hello"><div><p>Berth in the marina as directed or on the town quay (also administered by the marina) but there is no water or electricity here.</p>
<p>There is a good selection of sheltered anchorages in the bay, depending on the wind direction. There is good holding in the mud at the head of the bay or in the sand immediately to the west of the island of Kosijun.</p>
<p>There are several small ports and good anchorages all around the coast of the island of Krk.</p>
