<div class="hello"><div><p>Moor to the breakwater on the SE side of the bay. The berths at the outer end have a depth of 5 or 6m which decreases to 2m at the SW end.</p>
<p><span>There are now mooring balls just outside of the inner harbour.  These are strong, well spaced moorings anchored to 5-ton blocks.  The charge is 150Kn for boats 10m or less and 200Kn for boats 10-15m.  The price is half the cost of mooring on the inner mole.</span></p>
<p>Anchor in the bay, to the south of the stone bollards. There is good holding in the mud.</p>
<p>Shelter can be found in some part of the bay in alnost all winds, although the entrance can be difficult in strong W and SW winds.</p>
