<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several berthing options here and which is chosen will probably depend on the wind direction.</p>
<p>The <i>bora</i> here blows from the ENE and can arrive with little warning.</p>
<p>Possible berths are to be found:-<br>
On the southernside of the northern pier, clear of the ferries.<br>
On the western side of the pier in the SE corner.<br>
Alongside the quay by the harbour office on the southern side.</br></br></br></p>
