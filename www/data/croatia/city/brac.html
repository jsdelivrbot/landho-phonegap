<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several harbours on this island, from Milna on the west coast to Sumartin on the east. Bol is the only one on the southern side. The others mentioned are all on the northern coast.</p>
<p>Going round the island clockwise, these are the ports:-</p>
<p><i>Milna</i><br/> This is the best sheltered harbour. There are two marinas here. The quay opposite the fish factory is uncomfortable due to the speed at which the ferry passes this stretch. The main quay is very conveniently positioned but is often full of charter boats. Marina Vlaska is in the inlet opposite the fuel berth.</p>
<p><i>Supetar</i><br/> This harbour suffers from surge caused by the ferries and tripper boats, also the afternoon breeze can cause an uncomforatable chop. Berth alongside the inner breakwater or in the inner harbour where there is space.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the bay to the west of the harbour for a short trip ashore.</p>
<p><i>Splitska</i><br/> Lying just 2NM E of Supetar. The southwestern arm of this two pronged inlet provides an anchorage in 3 to 8m. The south eastern arm has a quay in front of the village. Both arms are exposed to the northerly winds.</p>
<p><i>Pucisca</i><br/> This is an attractive town with many old houses and several castles. The harbour is in the SW arm of this long inlet. Moor stern-to in the main part of the harbour. Not a comfortable harbour in strong winds <i>bora</i>.</p>
<p><i>Povlja</i><br/> Good shelter in most winds. Berth behind the pier, if possible, otherwise moor to the quay.</p>
<p><i>Sumartin</i><br/> A southerly wind causes a big swell in this harbour, otherwise it is sheltered. Berth stern-to in the main harbour.</p>
<p><i>Bol</i><br/> Good shelter except from the SW. Berth where there is space.</p>
