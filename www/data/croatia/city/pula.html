<div class="hello"><div><p><b>Marinas</b></p>
<p>There is the option of using a marina berth in the main harbour or in the huge Veruda Marina at Luka Veruda, just to the south. The latter marina being 10 nm from Pula by sea, but only 2 miles by land.</p>
<p>Another option is the Uljanik Sailing Club, also in Luka Veruda.</p>
<p><b>Anchoring</b></p>
<p>Anchoring is possible here, pay the Port Authority by the night. Whilst the city is beautiful, the harbour is reported to be dirty and the bottom foul in places. Getting ashore with your dinghy, you may have to negotiate finding a place to tie up. Cruisers report that the fuel dock are quite helpful, however the ACI Marina will demand papers and payment to use their docks.</p>
<p>Ancoring spots with good shelter include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>In Pula harbour, just N of Gat Rijeka, in 6 to 7m. Good holding in sticky mud.</span></li>
<li><span>In the northern part of Pula harbour, in slightly deeper water.</span></li>
<li><span>In the southern part of Luka Veruda.</span></li>
<li><span>At the E end of Uvala Kanalic, in 11m in mud, or in shallower water in one of the inlets on the southern side. Uvala Kanalic is just south of Luka Veruda.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br/>Security Note:</strong><span> In 2012 there were a spate of dinghy and outboard thefts reported. See recomendations in the </span><a href="Countries/Croatia">Security section.</a></p>
