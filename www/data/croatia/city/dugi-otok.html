<p><i>Veli Rat</i><br/> There is a very sheltered marina here on the west coast at the northern end of the island.</p>
<p><i>Sali</i><br/> This is a fishing port on the SE coast. There are visitors' berths on the east and southwest quays in the harbour.</p>
<p><i>Bozava</i><br/> This popular port is on the NE coast. Berth to the inner side of the pier or anchor close to the north shore at the harbour entrance and take lines ashore.</p>
<p><i>Luka Telascica</i><br/> There are a number of visitors' buoys in this inlet at the southern end of the island.</p>
<p><i>Uvala Lucina</i><br/> There are several mooring buoys here for visitors. It is also possible to anchor in 3 to 10m. Holding is reasonably good in sand.</p>
<p><i>Brbinj</i><br/> This is an attractive cove on the NE coast of Dugi Otok. There are several options here:-<br/> Berth to the quay in the NW part of the bay.<br/> Pick up a mooring buoy on the eastern side. <br/> Anchor either opposite the quay in 6 to 10m or in the inlet in the SW corner in 4m in mud.</p>
<p>This island provides many possible anchorages. The ones mentioned are just a few of them.</p>
