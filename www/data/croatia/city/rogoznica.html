<div class="hello"><div><p>Rogoznica is a small island lying in a deep sheltered bay, about 20NM from Sibenik to the north and 30NM from Split to the south. It is covered by thick pinewoods that come right down to the shore. The island is connected to the mainland by a causeway. It is known for its fresh fish, especially the fish soup prepared à la Rogoznica. </p>

<p>Frapa Marina : ©www.croatiasailigexperience.com</p>
<p>The harbour is deep and well protected. The marina here has been built on the mainland shore just to the west of the village.</p>
<p>Berth in the marina as directed or to the quay on the west side of the island. Avoid the fishing berths.</p>
<p>There are several options for anchoring in the bay, but take care to avoid the rocky patches. Uvala Soline, Uvala Stupin and Uvala Saline are all possible anchorages.</p>
