<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a port popular with Italian yachts, so an early arrival is advised to obtain a berth.</p>
<p>Berth stern-to on the SW side of the harbour. There is w<span>ater and electricity on the quay.</span> There are several bars and restaurants here.</p>
<p>If a quieter berth is preferred, moor to the quay at the village of Kut where shelter is better in a south westerly.</p>
<p>There are several anchorages in the outer bay but ensure your anchor penetrates the weed. Anchoring is not permitted in the inner bay.</p>
