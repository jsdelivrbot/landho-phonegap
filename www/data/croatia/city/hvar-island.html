<div class="hello"><div><p>Hvar Harbour is very popular and as a result the inner harbour gets very congested. Anchoring off is often the best solution. Yachts can anchor off the Borovac Islands off Hvar (43 09.61N 16 25.0E) for free and dinghy into Hvar town. Lots of traffic and poor holding can be a problem here. </p>
<p>An alternative is to use the marina at Palmizana and cross to Hvar using the water taxi (operates from June to August).</p>
<p>There is a coin operated laundrette in Hvar town. It is situated by the public toilets on the road from the harbour, very near to the bus station</p>
<p>There are many anchorages and several other harbours around the island. Apart from Hvar Harbour, Stari Grad, Jelsa, Sucuraj and Vrboska all offer good berthing. The latter place has a marina.</p>
