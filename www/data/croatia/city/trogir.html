<div class="hello"><div><p>On the mainland opposite the western end of the island of Clovo, to which it is connected by a low bridge, Trogir is a useful port for crew changes as it is close to Split airport.</p>
<p>It is an interesting historic town.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>The recently renovated Trogir Waterfront is an ideal place for berthing, but it is almost exclusively reserved for mega-yachts during summer season. Although it may be worth contacting the harbour master in advance for a reservation.</p>
<p>Boats under 25m generally berth in the nearby Marina Trogir (just across Trogir Waterfront) or on Island Ciovo waterfront. Marina Trogir has recently been taken over by the Camper and Nicholson  Group and has plans for expansion, the first phase due to be completed by May 2015. Advisable to call in advance to book a berth.</p>
<p>Yachts can anchor West of the old town, on the N side of the channel and inside the 5m contour. It is also possible to anchor in 2m on to the east of the low bridge. Anchoring East of the line between Rt. Cubrijan and the pier at Seget. Some boats have reported being asked for an anchoring fee here.</p>
<p>The water in this harbour is reported to be very dirty.</p>
<p>An alternative berth may be found at <a href="http://www.noonsite.com/Countries/Croatia/MarinaAgana"><strong>Marina Agana</strong></a> which lies at the head of a bay 6nm due west of Trogir.</p>
<p>Last updated October 2014.</p></div></div>
