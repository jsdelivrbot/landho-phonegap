<div class="hello"><div><p>There are several small harbours and anchorages as well as three good marinas around this bay.</p>
<p>The Spinut yacht harbours are on the opposite side of the spit from Split, on the SE coast of the bay. These two marinas are adjacent, PSD being the larger.</p>
<p>The other marina, Kastela, is due north across the bay. The winds here can be strong and cause difficulties when berthing.</p>
<p>At the western end of the bay, there is a low bridge (2.4m) connecting the island of Clovo to the mainland and the town of Trogir. This bars yachts from reaching Trogir by this route.</p>
