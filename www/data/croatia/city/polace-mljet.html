<div class="hello"><div><p>This is a very sheltered and attractive harbour.</p>
<p>Moor to the quay near the castle but beware of the shallow patches. The quay east of the ferry berth is free to patrons of the restauants which front it.</p>
<p>It is also possible to anchor in the bay. The northern part offers the best shelter and the holding is good in the mud there.</p>
<p>There are several more smaller harbours along the NE coast of the island and plenty of anchorages.</p>
