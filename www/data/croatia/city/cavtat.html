<p>It makes a pleasent base from which to visit Dubrovnik, 6 miles away.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p><strong>Port of Entry: Summer only</strong></p>
<p>It's advisable if coming from Greece to clear in either here or at Gruz, near Dubrovnik, to avoid problems further North. <span>It is the most convenient, southernmost Port of Entry. It may be a better option for clearing in than Dubrovnik, where the officials are busy with cruise ship and ferries during the summer. </span></p>
<p><span>Noonsite has however received mixed reports from cruisers about the officials' behaviour here, and several cruisers have reported being charged for mooring at the Customs quay</span><span> whilst attending to entry procedures (a restrictive practice which contravenes EU regulations). This is termed as a "mooring service" but you have the right to refuse their help and not pay the fee - see comments at bottom of page.</span></p>
<p>The Customs dock is on the port side of the town bay, identified by a large yellow board with letter Q. It is mandatory for yachts clearing in and out of Croatia to moor at this quay.</p>
<p>First go to the Police, situated about 50m to the North (through a garden). Fill in a crew list which is stamped and leave your passports. Then take the crew list to the Port Captain who completes further formalities and issues the Vignette. Take papers back to the Police who return the passports.</p>

<div class="hello"><div><p>There are two sheltered bays. The larger one, on the other side of the peninsula from the harbour, is good and secure; it is also free. Anchoring in the bay by the harbour is chargable in high season. Depth is 10 to 12m.</p>
<p>There are stern-to moorings along the quay, but it is often very full, largely with super-yachts.</p>
<p>In neither bay is shelter good in strong Northerlies.</p>
<p>See comments below on the "mooring service" provided here.</p>
