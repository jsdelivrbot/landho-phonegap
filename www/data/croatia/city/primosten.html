<div class="hello"><div><p>There is a quay on the southern side of the old town where v<span>isiting yachts have the option of mooring on the short town quay, where there are laid moorings with water and electricity, or picking up one of the dozen or so mooring buoys laid along the beach on the E side of the bay. Shelter is good in most conditions except strong SW winds, when it becomes very poor to untenable.</span></p>
<p>There is also a good anchorage in the bay, although again this is open to the south. A more sheltered berth may be found in the inlet to the east.</p>
<p><span>In settled weather, the bay just north of the town isthmus is a good anchorage.</span></p>
<p>About 2nm south of Premosten, is the very sheltered Kremik marina.</p>
