                Facts
                
                
            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>From Dubrovnik in the south to the Istra peninsula in the north, Croatia has an extensive coastline indented with innumerable bays and there are hundreds of islands that abound in scenic anchorages. More and more mooring buoys are appearing in popular anchorages as local authorities grant more concessions. Whilst this development somewhat kills the charm of anchoring in bays, it does mean that more boats can stay in these bays and safety has improved considerably.</li>
<li>The establishment of the Croatian coast as a popular cruising destination in the 1980s seemed threatened by the war which followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. After a spate of fighting on the coast, which saw the destruction of parts of Dubrovnik, hostilities continued mostly inland. The Dalmatian islands and most of Northern Croatia were not touched by the war and by the summer of 1999 most damaged buildings as well as the marina in Dubrovnik had been restored.</li>
<li>Croatia is one of the prime cruising destinations in the Mediterranean. It is an especially popular destination for Italian motor-boaters, particularly during August, and many marinas are full by mid afternoon.</li>
<li>Facilities along the entire Croatian coast are of a very good standard. There are approximately 40 marinas along the coast and as a minimum they have a 10 ton crane and the necessary frame to lift boats up to that weight. There are travelifts with a minimum capacity of 30 tons at Umag, Cres, Sukosan, Hramina, Murter, Bettina, Mali Losinj, Kremik, Vodice and Dubrovnik. The biggest concentration of boatyards is in the Zadar Sibenik area. </li>
<li>Croatia is now however becoming one of the more expensive Mediterranean countries to cruise. Not only is the practice of charging for anchoring becoming more prevalent (normally 50% of the docking fee), but a new "Sojourn Tax" was introduced in 2010 in addition to the expensive cruising permit, fees for changing crews and other official fees. There is no official list of ports that charge for anchoring, however noonsite has noted under each port if it is known that charges are made.</li>
<li>Fuel and provisions are available in most places. Marine equipment is limited, although Split and Trogir have good chandleries. One should carry all essential spares.</li>
<li><span>Croatia joined the EU on 1July 2013. Immigration rules and permitted length of stay for the boat will then be in line with EU practice. Croatia hopes to be within the Schengen zone by 2015.</span></li>

<div><p><b>April 2016:<i> Security levels at ports raised when cruise ships in dock due to terrorism concerns.<br/></i></b><span>Whilst on the whole most cruise ship docks are seperate from yacht marinas/quays in Croatia, there are some ports </span><span>where the 2 share the same quay. As the port authority secure the dock whilst the cruise ship is in port, with no prior warning, this can be very inconvenient for yacht crew wishing to get off or on their boat. It is recommended to enquire if berthing at a shared cruise ship dock if/when the next cruise ship is expected, so you can plan accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Dinghy Thefts</b></span></p>
<p>In common with many areas in Europe and elsewhere, dinghy theft can be a problem. Ensure that it is well secured to the boat with chain and lock, lifted out of the water at night and that also the outboard is as difficult to remove as possible.</p>
<p>The latest report (2012) is of a spate of such thefts at Uvala Kanalic, near Pula.</p>
