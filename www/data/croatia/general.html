<p><strong>Adriatic Pilot - Croatia,Slovenia, Montenegro, East Coast of Italy, Albania</strong><br/> By Trevor and Dinah Thompson <br/> Publisher Imray, Laurie, Norie, Wilson Ltd (8th Edition 2008)<br/> ISBN 978 085288970-1<br/> Adriatic Pilot is the standard guide to Croatia and the neighbouring countries of Slovenia, Montenegro and Albania which provides coverage of the eastern coast of Italy, and is the only guide to the Venice Lagoon and harbours adjacent to Istria, and at present is the only book that covers the entire Adriatic region in a single volume.</p>
<p><strong>Croatian Charts</strong> M24,25,26 and 27 covering the entire Croatian Coast from the Golfo di Trieste in the North to Bar and Ulcinj in the South.</p>
<p><strong>777 Harbours and Anchorages - Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Albania</strong><br/> By Anna and Rod Bailey<br/> Publisher Edizioni Magnamare<br/> ISBN 978 8862000123<br/> 777 contains detailed, up-to-date information on more than 1000 ports and anchorages, as well as the technical details which are of most interest to pleasure yachters: the phone numbers of the Marinas and Harbourmaster's offices, the facilities available, mooring facilities, where to buy provisions. Besides the main harbours, there are charts showing solitary, nearly unknown coves; this result was achieved thanks to the patience and precision of the author. Also contains a few hints and coves which were added to the original book, thanks to the contributions by editors, Piero and Silvia Magnabosco.</p>
