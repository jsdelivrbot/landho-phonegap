<div><p><b>Update January 2016: </b>Due to the current situation with regard to the number of migrants and refugees attempting to enter Europe, a number of Schengen Area countries have re-introduced border controls. Therefore, it is advisable that cruisers now check with the official authorities when entering or leaving a country.<span> </span></p>
<p>While at sea it is also advisable that any sightings of refugee/migrant boats be immediately reported to the appropriate Coast Guard via VHF. This is especially important if it is necessary to rescue any whose life is in danger.</p>
<p><i>Croatian Authorities are reported to be very strict and "by the book". Failure to comply with the correct procedures can result in hefty fines (see comments from cruisers at bottom of page and this <a href="Countries/Croatia/croatia-clearance-do-so-immediately-on-arrival-or-risk-being-fined/"><strong>noonsite report</strong></a>).<br/></i></p>
<p>On arrival in Croatian waters, the yacht must make its way to the nearest official Port of Entry* and <strong>clear in immediately</strong> even if this is at night. In some ports the officials might come to come to the yacht for clearance. In marinas, the staff will call the relevant officials.</p>
<p>If necessary the skipper should go ashore and report to the police for passport control, as well as Customs and Harbour Master. The crew must remain on board until formalities are complete.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that if the yacht has an operational AIS, its movements will be tracked and the time of your arrival at a port recorded.</p>
<p>Skippers are required to obtain a cruising permit (vignette) and pay the  fee for safe navigation, marine information chart and light fee, and a one-off payment for the sojourn tax. This can all be done at the same time at the port authority or branch office of the port authority. See<strong> <a href="Countries/Croatia/?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> below for more details.</p>
<p>For further information on the cruising permit and other paperwork expected by Croatian officials, see <a href="Countries/Croatia/?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents</strong></a> below.</p>
<p>It is necessary to list (together with passport information etc.) everyone who is either on the yacht are entry or who plan to join it while in Croatian waters.  See <a href="http://www.mppi.hr/userdocsimages/2005/041231-uredba-dolazak-boravak-engl.pdf"><strong>www.mppi.hr</strong></a> for the full details for foreign yacht regulations.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to amend the list of people on board after you have entered the country. Take the passports of your new visitors to the nearest Harbour Master's Office, make a new crew list, and amend the list that accompanies the cruising permit. The procedure is free of charge.</p>
<p>The yacht will not be allowed to carry persons who are not mentioned on the official list, and any yacht found to be in breach of this will be considered to be undertaking illegal chartering.</p>
<p><span>Boats leaving Croatia must obtain clearance from the Harbour Master at a port of entry. The vessel must leave Croatian territorial waters immediately and by the shortest route.</span></p>

<div><p>The Customs regulations for Croatia are now the same as other  EU member states.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This means that non-EU yachts may now only stay in the country for 18 months before import tax/VAT is payable.</p>
<p>Boats which were berthed in Croatia before it joined the EU may now be forced to pay a significant fee (possibly in cash and without a receipt) before they can be re-launched and leave the country. See Yachting Monthly article <a href="http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/536737/sailors-flee-croatia-as-eu-fees-imposed"><strong>http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/536737/sailors-flee-croatia-as-eu-fees-imposed#</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Unusual for EU countries, Croatian Customs require EU boat owners to produce evidence of a boat's VAT paid status. <span>Despite the fact that a VAT invoice is also evidence of the boat’s status for Customs purposes, the Croatian authorities are insisting that boat owners have a T2L in addition to any VAT paperwork. <span>A T2L document is not normally issued to boats sold new within the EU, just to those imported. <span>Marinas and shipping agents inspecting paperwork have been demanding a T2L for pleasure craft that will never have been issued with a T2L because they are of EU origin. A notice <span>issued by Croatian Customs acknowledges that documents other than a T2L are acceptable to prove community status (e.g. a VAT invoice), but Croatian Customs is not ensuring that people inspecting paperwork (presumably on its behalf) understand this.</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>Foreign citizens spending more than 500 kuna are entitled to a VAT refund by handing to the Customs authorities the PDV-P form  on departure from Croatia.</p>
<p>Valuable and professional and technical equipment must be declared on entering the country</p>
<p>Import of meat and dairy products without prior veterinary inspection is limited to 1 kg, while the import of alcoholic beverages is limited only up to 5 litres.</p>
<p>Firearms must be declared on arrival and will be sealed and checked again when leaving. All details of the firearms must be entered on the cruising permit.</p>
<p>Radio equipment must be declared and an operator's permit shown. CB and portable VHF radios need a special permit.</p>

<div><p>Diving Emergencies
There are some 200 doctors in Croatia trained in diving medicine and skilled to deal with diving emergencies. Most of them live and work along the coast and on the islands of the Croatian Adriatic. They could be reached dialing "94", the unique phone number for medical emergencies in Croatia. Dialing this number you will reach the nearest urgent medicine facility in the area, and get an advice or help.</p>

<div><p>See the above Customs section for the difficulties that might be encountered regarding a boat's VAT paid status. U.K. boats can obtain a T2L form by applying the the RYA at <a href="mailto:T2L@rya.org.uk">T2L@rya.org.uk</a></p>
<p><b>Cruising Permit</b></p>
<p>A cruising permit is issued on arrival at the port of entry in the form of a licence disc or sticker and must be displayed prominently on the yacht. A counterfoil of the licence will be affixed to the crew list after it has been approved by the Harbourmaster.</p>
<p>The permit lasts for the calendar year and covers any number of exits and entries, but must be stamped at each major port by the harbour master and customs. The permit allows a yacht to cruise along the entire coast including the islands, except for certain prohibited areas.</p>
<p>When obtaining your cruising permit on entry into Croatia, you must complete a crew list, crew changes are possible, but all the  different individuals that may be on board the boat during the validity of the one year permit should be listed. It is possible for this list to be amended, but such amendments must be endorsed at a Harbour Master's office. <span>Children under 12 are not included.</span></p>
<p>It is not possible for a boat to have more than one cruising permit in a 12 month period.</p>
<p>Be sure to organise renewal of the cruising permit in advance of the expiry date as fines for not having a valid permit are high.</p>
<p><b>Certificate of Competence</b></p>
<p><span>Even though it may not be required by the cruiser's flag state, Croatian officials still expect to see a certificate of sailing competency. <br/></span><span>Read</span><b><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Croatia/croatia-boat-driver-s-license-make-sure-you-have-your-icc/"> this American's Experience</a></b><span> for further details.</span><span><br/></span>Also this <a href="General/CruisingInformation/DOCUMENTS%20YOU%20WILL%20NEED/icc-now-available-to-all">Noonsite report</a><span> and the </span><a href="General/EuropeanUnion"><strong>Noonsite/European page</strong></a><span> with information on the International Certificate of Competence (ICC) if you need to obtain one.</span></p>

<p><b>Other Documents</b></p>
<p>3rd party insurance, proof of ownership or permission to use the craft, and, if an EU registered boat, evidence of its VAT status, are required (see details above).</p>
<p>The full regulations can be found at <a href="http://www.mmtpr.hr"><strong>www.mmtpr.hr</strong></a> (select English, then Sea, then Nautics). As there have been a number of updates, you need to look at several documents before you have all the information.</p>
